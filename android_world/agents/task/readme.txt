Do not forget to install ADBKeyboard.

By accident I doubled the limit of max steps as I assumed that Android World would give me the expected numbers of steps but they gave me double that.
If there is an error with Gemini (e.g., server problems, no internet connection), a task is restarted.

While testing I saw that these Simple apps have a different name in the AppDrawer than in the task.
I thought it was kinda pointless to watch the agent fail for hours trying to find the apps, so I added the names as tips.
(Maybe the name of the Simple Apps changed? At least I think the tasks are wrong these are not the Pro version. Those should cost money.)

I always copied the results displayed into the terminal per hand and wrote success : true or succees : false at the end of the file.
(I probably should have automated this.)
Except once: The task OpenAppTaskEval did not seem to run properly. I changed the granding to failure.
