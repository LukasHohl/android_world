By accident I doubled the limit of max steps as I assumed that Android World would give me the expected numbers of steps but they gave me double that.

Additionally, I graded some task per hand because of strange errors like this:
W0514 12:18:03.743592 126966152508928 task_eval.py:123] Skipping app snapshot loading : Snapshot not found in /data/data/android_world/snapshots/net.gsantner.markor.
I get these all the time and sometime the grading does not seem to be correct.
