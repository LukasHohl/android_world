Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, you plan to add important text information to the agent\\'s memory.

We need to confirm Markor is open (`MarkorAppOpen`).\\n2.  **Navigate to \"StudyGuides\" folder**: Once Markor is open, we need to find and open the \"StudyGuides\" folder where the note is currently located. We need to confirm this folder is open (`StudyGuidesFolderOpen`).\\n3.  **Find and select the note**: Inside \"StudyGuides\", we must locate \"shy_king_copy.md\" and select it, likely via a long press, to bring up options for file operations. We need to confirm the note is selected (`NoteFoundAndSelected`).\\n4.  **Initiate move operation**: After selecting the note, we need to find and activate the \"Move\" (or similar) command from a context menu or action bar. We need to confirm the move UI is active (`MoveOperationInitiated`).\\n5.  **Select \"MeetingMinutes\" as destination**: In the move UI, we need to navigate to and select the \"MeetingMinutes\" folder as the target destination for the note. We need to confirm this folder is selected (`DestinationFolderSelected`).\\n6.  **Confirm the move**: Finally, we need to confirm the move action, usually by tapping a \"Confirm\" or \"Move\" button. We then need to verify the note has been moved successfully (`MoveConfirmed`). This involves checking its presence in \"MeetingMinutes\" and absence from \"StudyGuides\", or observing a success message. After confirmation, an answer will be sent to the user.\\n\\nThis step-by-step approach ensures each part of the user\\'s request is addressed systematically.

Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 798], \\'text\\': \\'Prs: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 65, 948], \\'text\\': \\'Size: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [123, 46, 147, 306], \\'text\\': \\'Sun; Oct 15\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 336, 722, 431], \\'text\\': \\'Gmail\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 561, 722, 676], \\'text\\': \\'Photos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [704, 781, 722, 921], \\'text\\': \\'YouTube\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [775, 295, 872, 709], \\'text\\': \\'0 (9\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 72, 855, 232]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [788, 764, 856, 929]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 535, 858, 706]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 299, 856, 466]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [628, 536, 729, 695]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 764, 728, 927]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 299, 731, 463]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [900, 701, 948, 795]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [893, 801, 952, 923]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is predicted to reveal the app drawer, where the Markor app can be found. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to display a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, which is to open the Markor app. The Markor app icon is now visible.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[867,615],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon, which is located at approximately [867, 615]. This action is predicted to open the Markor app, bringing the agent to the app\\'s main screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Markor app icon at [867, 615] was successful. The Markor application opened, and its main screen, displaying a list of folders, is now visible. This completes the first subgoal and brings the agent closer to the overall user instruction. The folders \\'.app\\', \\'MeetingMinutes\\', and \\'StudyGuides\\' are visible.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.35\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [74, 38, 96, 203], \\'text\\': \\'Markor\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 728, 95, 888], \\'text\\': \\'= Q\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [143, 139, 167, 689], \\'text\\': \\'Istorage/emulated/0 /Documents\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [183, 143, 223, 449], \\'text\\': \\'.app 10/15/2023, 15.44\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [237, 144, 283, 493], \\'text\\': \\'MeetingMinutes 10/15/2023, 15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [298, 142, 343, 449], \\'text\\': \\'StudyGuides 10/15/2023, 15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [950, 85, 966, 163], \\'text\\': \\'Files\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [951, 332, 966, 417], \\'text\\': \\'To-Do\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 553, 966, 699], \\'text\\': \\'QuickNote\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 840, 966, 913], \\'text\\': \\'More\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [833, 819, 896, 969]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 494, 974, 758]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 0, 974, 257]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 253, 974, 499]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 907, 102, 985]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 813, 104, 895]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 822, 37, 899]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 617, 112, 704]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 836, 972, 914]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 710, 99, 796]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 905, 37, 943]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 194, 39, 241]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [984, 363, 1000, 634]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is predicted to reveal the app drawer, where the Markor app can be found. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to display a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, which is to open the Markor app. The Markor app icon is now visible.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

This action is predicted to open the Markor app, bringing the agent to the app\\'s main screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Markor app icon at [867, 615] was successful. The Markor application opened, and its main screen, displaying a list of folders, is now visible. This completes the first subgoal and brings the agent closer to the overall user instruction.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is predicted to reveal the app drawer, where the Markor app can be found. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to display a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, which is to open the Markor app. The Markor app icon is now visible.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[867,615],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon, which is located at approximately [867, 615]. This action is predicted to open the Markor app, bringing the agent to the app\\'s main screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Markor app icon at [867, 615] was successful. The Markor application opened, and its main screen, displaying a list of folders, is now visible. This completes the first subgoal and brings the agent closer to the overall user instruction. The folders \\'.app\\', \\'MeetingMinutes\\', and \\'StudyGuides\\' are visible.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[320,295],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"StudyGuides\" folder, which is located at approximately [320, 295]. This action is predicted to open the \"StudyGuides\" folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \"StudyGuides\" folder at [320, 295] was successful. The Markor app navigated into the \"StudyGuides\" folder, and its contents (a list of .md files) are now displayed on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully navigating to the source folder of the note to be moved. Subgoal 2 is now complete.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is predicted to reveal the app drawer, where the Markor app can be found. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to display a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, which is to open the Markor app. The Markor app icon is now visible.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[867,615],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon, which is located at approximately [867, 615]. This action is predicted to open the Markor app, bringing the agent to the app\\'s main screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Markor app icon at [867, 615] was successful. The Markor application opened, and its main screen, displaying a list of folders, is now visible. This completes the first subgoal and brings the agent closer to the overall user instruction. The folders \\'.app\\', \\'MeetingMinutes\\', and \\'StudyGuides\\' are visible.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[320,295],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"StudyGuides\" folder, which is located at approximately [320, 295]. This action is predicted to open the \"StudyGuides\" folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \"StudyGuides\" folder at [320, 295] was successful. The Markor app navigated into the \"StudyGuides\" folder, and its contents (a list of .md files) are now displayed on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully navigating to the source folder of the note to be moved. Subgoal 2 is now complete.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 3: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point.

This is predicted to select the file and open a context menu or enable a selection mode, which should allow for a \\'move\\' operation.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is predicted to reveal the app drawer, where the Markor app can be found. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to display a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, which is to open the Markor app. The Markor app icon is now visible.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[867,615],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon, which is located at approximately [867, 615]. This action is predicted to open the Markor app, bringing the agent to the app\\'s main screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Markor app icon at [867, 615] was successful. The Markor application opened, and its main screen, displaying a list of folders, is now visible. This completes the first subgoal and brings the agent closer to the overall user instruction. The folders \\'.app\\', \\'MeetingMinutes\\', and \\'StudyGuides\\' are visible.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[320,295],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"StudyGuides\" folder, which is located at approximately [320, 295]. This action is predicted to open the \"StudyGuides\" folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \"StudyGuides\" folder at [320, 295] was successful. The Markor app navigated into the \"StudyGuides\" folder, and its contents (a list of .md files) are now displayed on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully navigating to the source folder of the note to be moved. Subgoal 2 is now complete.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[201,469],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file named \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" (center coordinates [201, 469]). This is predicted to select the file and open a context menu or enable a selection mode, which should allow for a \\'move\\' operation. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the file \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" at coordinates [201, 469] did not result in any visible change on the screen. The file was not highlighted, no checkmark appeared, and no context menu was displayed. Therefore, the file was not selected.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is predicted to reveal the app drawer, where the Markor app can be found. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to display a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, which is to open the Markor app. The Markor app icon is now visible.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[867,615],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon, which is located at approximately [867, 615]. This action is predicted to open the Markor app, bringing the agent to the app\\'s main screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Markor app icon at [867, 615] was successful. The Markor application opened, and its main screen, displaying a list of folders, is now visible. This completes the first subgoal and brings the agent closer to the overall user instruction. The folders \\'.app\\', \\'MeetingMinutes\\', and \\'StudyGuides\\' are visible.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[320,295],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"StudyGuides\" folder, which is located at approximately [320, 295]. This action is predicted to open the \"StudyGuides\" folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \"StudyGuides\" folder at [320, 295] was successful. The Markor app navigated into the \"StudyGuides\" folder, and its contents (a list of .md files) are now displayed on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully navigating to the source folder of the note to be moved. Subgoal 2 is now complete.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[201,469],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file named \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" (center coordinates [201, 469]). This is predicted to select the file and open a context menu or enable a selection mode, which should allow for a \\'move\\' operation. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the file \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" at coordinates [201, 469] did not result in any visible change on the screen. The file was not highlighted, no checkmark appeared, and no context menu was displayed. Therefore, the file was not selected. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 4: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top-right of the screen (approximate coordinates [83, 945]). This is predicted to open a menu with options, potentially including a \\'Select\\' or \\'Move\\' option, which will help in selecting and moving the file. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16.

This action is predicted to reveal the app drawer, where the Markor app can be found. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to display a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, which is to open the Markor app. The Markor app icon is now visible.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[867,615],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon, which is located at approximately [867, 615]. This action is predicted to open the Markor app, bringing the agent to the app\\'s main screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Markor app icon at [867, 615] was successful. The Markor application opened, and its main screen, displaying a list of folders, is now visible. This completes the first subgoal and brings the agent closer to the overall user instruction. The folders \\'.app\\', \\'MeetingMinutes\\', and \\'StudyGuides\\' are visible.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[320,295],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"StudyGuides\" folder, which is located at approximately [320, 295]. This action is predicted to open the \"StudyGuides\" folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \"StudyGuides\" folder at [320, 295] was successful. The Markor app navigated into the \"StudyGuides\" folder, and its contents (a list of .md files) are now displayed on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully navigating to the source folder of the note to be moved. Subgoal 2 is now complete.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[201,469],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file named \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" (center coordinates [201, 469]). This is predicted to select the file and open a context menu or enable a selection mode, which should allow for a \\'move\\' operation. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the file \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" at coordinates [201, 469] did not result in any visible change on the screen. The file was not highlighted, no checkmark appeared, and no context menu was displayed. Therefore, the file was not selected. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top-right of the screen (approximate coordinates [83, 945]). This is predicted to open a menu with options, potentially including a \\'Select\\' or \\'Move\\' option, which will help in selecting and moving the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon (located at the top-right, approximate coordinates [83, 945] based on the red ring in the first image) was successful in opening a menu. The menu appeared at the top right of the screen and contains the options \"Import from device\" and \"Settings\". These options do not help with selecting the file \"shy_king_copy.md\" for moving. Therefore, this action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of selecting the note. The opened menu needs to be closed before another attempt to select the file can be made.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below.

This action is predicted to reveal the app drawer, where the Markor app can be found. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to display a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, which is to open the Markor app. The Markor app icon is now visible.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[867,615],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon, which is located at approximately [867, 615]. This action is predicted to open the Markor app, bringing the agent to the app\\'s main screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Markor app icon at [867, 615] was successful. The Markor application opened, and its main screen, displaying a list of folders, is now visible. This completes the first subgoal and brings the agent closer to the overall user instruction. The folders \\'.app\\', \\'MeetingMinutes\\', and \\'StudyGuides\\' are visible.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[320,295],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"StudyGuides\" folder, which is located at approximately [320, 295]. This action is predicted to open the \"StudyGuides\" folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \"StudyGuides\" folder at [320, 295] was successful. The Markor app navigated into the \"StudyGuides\" folder, and its contents (a list of .md files) are now displayed on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully navigating to the source folder of the note to be moved. Subgoal 2 is now complete.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[201,469],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file named \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" (center coordinates [201, 469]). This is predicted to select the file and open a context menu or enable a selection mode, which should allow for a \\'move\\' operation. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the file \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" at coordinates [201, 469] did not result in any visible change on the screen. The file was not highlighted, no checkmark appeared, and no context menu was displayed. Therefore, the file was not selected. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top-right of the screen (approximate coordinates [83, 945]). This is predicted to open a menu with options, potentially including a \\'Select\\' or \\'Move\\' option, which will help in selecting and moving the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon (located at the top-right, approximate coordinates [83, 945] based on the red ring in the first image) was successful in opening a menu. The menu appeared at the top right of the screen and contains the options \"Import from device\" and \"Settings\". These options do not help with selecting the file \"shy_king_copy.md\" for moving. Therefore, this action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of selecting the note. The opened menu needs to be closed before another attempt to select the file can be made.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 5: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to close the currently open menu (\\'Import from device\\', \\'Settings\\'). This is predicted to return the screen to the file list view without the menu, allowing for interaction with the files themselves. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[867,615],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon, which is located at approximately [867, 615]. This action is predicted to open the Markor app, bringing the agent to the app\\'s main screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Markor app icon at [867, 615] was successful. The Markor application opened, and its main screen, displaying a list of folders, is now visible. This completes the first subgoal and brings the agent closer to the overall user instruction. The folders \\'.app\\', \\'MeetingMinutes\\', and \\'StudyGuides\\' are visible.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[320,295],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"StudyGuides\" folder, which is located at approximately [320, 295]. This action is predicted to open the \"StudyGuides\" folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \"StudyGuides\" folder at [320, 295] was successful. The Markor app navigated into the \"StudyGuides\" folder, and its contents (a list of .md files) are now displayed on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully navigating to the source folder of the note to be moved. Subgoal 2 is now complete.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[201,469],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file named \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" (center coordinates [201, 469]). This is predicted to select the file and open a context menu or enable a selection mode, which should allow for a \\'move\\' operation. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the file \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" at coordinates [201, 469] did not result in any visible change on the screen. The file was not highlighted, no checkmark appeared, and no context menu was displayed. Therefore, the file was not selected. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top-right of the screen (approximate coordinates [83, 945]). This is predicted to open a menu with options, potentially including a \\'Select\\' or \\'Move\\' option, which will help in selecting and moving the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon (located at the top-right, approximate coordinates [83, 945] based on the red ring in the first image) was successful in opening a menu. The menu appeared at the top right of the screen and contains the options \"Import from device\" and \"Settings\". These options do not help with selecting the file \"shy_king_copy.md\" for moving. Therefore, this action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of selecting the note. The opened menu needs to be closed before another attempt to select the file can be made.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to close the currently open menu (\\'Import from device\\', \\'Settings\\'). This is predicted to return the screen to the file list view without the menu, allowing for interaction with the files themselves. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action was successful. The menu (\"Import from device\", \"Settings\") that was previously open at the top right of the screen is now closed. The screen displays the list of files within the \"StudyGuides\" folder. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by clearing the overlaying menu, allowing for further interaction with the files to select the target note.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[867,615],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon, which is located at approximately [867, 615]. This action is predicted to open the Markor app, bringing the agent to the app\\'s main screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Markor app icon at [867, 615] was successful. The Markor application opened, and its main screen, displaying a list of folders, is now visible. This completes the first subgoal and brings the agent closer to the overall user instruction. The folders \\'.app\\', \\'MeetingMinutes\\', and \\'StudyGuides\\' are visible.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[320,295],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"StudyGuides\" folder, which is located at approximately [320, 295]. This action is predicted to open the \"StudyGuides\" folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \"StudyGuides\" folder at [320, 295] was successful. The Markor app navigated into the \"StudyGuides\" folder, and its contents (a list of .md files) are now displayed on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully navigating to the source folder of the note to be moved. Subgoal 2 is now complete.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[201,469],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file named \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" (center coordinates [201, 469]). This is predicted to select the file and open a context menu or enable a selection mode, which should allow for a \\'move\\' operation. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the file \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" at coordinates [201, 469] did not result in any visible change on the screen. The file was not highlighted, no checkmark appeared, and no context menu was displayed. Therefore, the file was not selected. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top-right of the screen (approximate coordinates [83, 945]). This is predicted to open a menu with options, potentially including a \\'Select\\' or \\'Move\\' option, which will help in selecting and moving the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon (located at the top-right, approximate coordinates [83, 945] based on the red ring in the first image) was successful in opening a menu. The menu appeared at the top right of the screen and contains the options \"Import from device\" and \"Settings\". These options do not help with selecting the file \"shy_king_copy.md\" for moving. Therefore, this action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of selecting the note. The opened menu needs to be closed before another attempt to select the file can be made.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to close the currently open menu (\\'Import from device\\', \\'Settings\\'). This is predicted to return the screen to the file list view without the menu, allowing for interaction with the files themselves. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action was successful. The menu (\"Import from device\", \"Settings\") that was previously open at the top right of the screen is now closed. The screen displays the list of files within the \"StudyGuides\" folder. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by clearing the overlaying menu, allowing for further interaction with the files to select the target note.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 6: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[200,79],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file icon associated with \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\", located approximately at [200, 79]. This is predicted to select the file, potentially highlighting it or opening a context menu with options like \\'Move\\'.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[320,295],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"StudyGuides\" folder, which is located at approximately [320, 295]. This action is predicted to open the \"StudyGuides\" folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \"StudyGuides\" folder at [320, 295] was successful. The Markor app navigated into the \"StudyGuides\" folder, and its contents (a list of .md files) are now displayed on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully navigating to the source folder of the note to be moved. Subgoal 2 is now complete.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[201,469],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file named \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" (center coordinates [201, 469]). This is predicted to select the file and open a context menu or enable a selection mode, which should allow for a \\'move\\' operation. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the file \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" at coordinates [201, 469] did not result in any visible change on the screen. The file was not highlighted, no checkmark appeared, and no context menu was displayed. Therefore, the file was not selected. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top-right of the screen (approximate coordinates [83, 945]). This is predicted to open a menu with options, potentially including a \\'Select\\' or \\'Move\\' option, which will help in selecting and moving the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon (located at the top-right, approximate coordinates [83, 945] based on the red ring in the first image) was successful in opening a menu. The menu appeared at the top right of the screen and contains the options \"Import from device\" and \"Settings\". These options do not help with selecting the file \"shy_king_copy.md\" for moving. Therefore, this action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of selecting the note. The opened menu needs to be closed before another attempt to select the file can be made.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to close the currently open menu (\\'Import from device\\', \\'Settings\\'). This is predicted to return the screen to the file list view without the menu, allowing for interaction with the files themselves. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action was successful. The menu (\"Import from device\", \"Settings\") that was previously open at the top right of the screen is now closed. The screen displays the list of files within the \"StudyGuides\" folder. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by clearing the overlaying menu, allowing for further interaction with the files to select the target note.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[200,79],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file icon associated with \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\", located approximately at [200, 79]. This is predicted to select the file, potentially highlighting it or opening a context menu with options like \\'Move\\'. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the file icon for \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" at [200, 79] was unsuccessful in selecting the file. The screen remained unchanged, with no indication that the file was selected (e.g., no highlighting, checkmark, or context menu). This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of selecting the note.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[320,295],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"StudyGuides\" folder, which is located at approximately [320, 295]. This action is predicted to open the \"StudyGuides\" folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \"StudyGuides\" folder at [320, 295] was successful. The Markor app navigated into the \"StudyGuides\" folder, and its contents (a list of .md files) are now displayed on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully navigating to the source folder of the note to be moved. Subgoal 2 is now complete.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[201,469],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file named \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" (center coordinates [201, 469]). This is predicted to select the file and open a context menu or enable a selection mode, which should allow for a \\'move\\' operation. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the file \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" at coordinates [201, 469] did not result in any visible change on the screen. The file was not highlighted, no checkmark appeared, and no context menu was displayed. Therefore, the file was not selected. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top-right of the screen (approximate coordinates [83, 945]). This is predicted to open a menu with options, potentially including a \\'Select\\' or \\'Move\\' option, which will help in selecting and moving the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon (located at the top-right, approximate coordinates [83, 945] based on the red ring in the first image) was successful in opening a menu. The menu appeared at the top right of the screen and contains the options \"Import from device\" and \"Settings\". These options do not help with selecting the file \"shy_king_copy.md\" for moving. Therefore, this action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of selecting the note. The opened menu needs to be closed before another attempt to select the file can be made.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to close the currently open menu (\\'Import from device\\', \\'Settings\\'). This is predicted to return the screen to the file list view without the menu, allowing for interaction with the files themselves. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action was successful. The menu (\"Import from device\", \"Settings\") that was previously open at the top right of the screen is now closed. The screen displays the list of files within the \"StudyGuides\" folder. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by clearing the overlaying menu, allowing for further interaction with the files to select the target note.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[200,79],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file icon associated with \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\", located approximately at [200, 79]. This is predicted to select the file, potentially highlighting it or opening a context menu with options like \\'Move\\'. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the file icon for \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" at [200, 79] was unsuccessful in selecting the file. The screen remained unchanged, with no indication that the file was selected (e.g., no highlighting, checkmark, or context menu). This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of selecting the note. A different interaction method is required.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 7: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[201,469],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file named \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" (center coordinates [201, 469]). This is predicted to either open the file for editing or select it. If it opens for editing, the next step will be to press back. If it selects the file, the next step will be to look for a move option. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[201,469],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file named \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" (center coordinates [201, 469]). This is predicted to select the file and open a context menu or enable a selection mode, which should allow for a \\'move\\' operation. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the file \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" at coordinates [201, 469] did not result in any visible change on the screen. The file was not highlighted, no checkmark appeared, and no context menu was displayed. Therefore, the file was not selected. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top-right of the screen (approximate coordinates [83, 945]). This is predicted to open a menu with options, potentially including a \\'Select\\' or \\'Move\\' option, which will help in selecting and moving the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon (located at the top-right, approximate coordinates [83, 945] based on the red ring in the first image) was successful in opening a menu. The menu appeared at the top right of the screen and contains the options \"Import from device\" and \"Settings\". These options do not help with selecting the file \"shy_king_copy.md\" for moving. Therefore, this action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of selecting the note. The opened menu needs to be closed before another attempt to select the file can be made.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to close the currently open menu (\\'Import from device\\', \\'Settings\\'). This is predicted to return the screen to the file list view without the menu, allowing for interaction with the files themselves. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action was successful. The menu (\"Import from device\", \"Settings\") that was previously open at the top right of the screen is now closed. The screen displays the list of files within the \"StudyGuides\" folder. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by clearing the overlaying menu, allowing for further interaction with the files to select the target note.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[200,79],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file icon associated with \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\", located approximately at [200, 79]. This is predicted to select the file, potentially highlighting it or opening a context menu with options like \\'Move\\'. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the file icon for \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" at [200, 79] was unsuccessful in selecting the file. The screen remained unchanged, with no indication that the file was selected (e.g., no highlighting, checkmark, or context menu). This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of selecting the note. A different interaction method is required.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[201,469],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file named \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" (center coordinates [201, 469]). This is predicted to either open the file for editing or select it. If it opens for editing, the next step will be to press back. If it selects the file, the next step will be to look for a move option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the file named \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" (center coordinates [201, 469]) resulted in the file being opened for editing. The screen changed from the file list view to the editor view, displaying the content of the note. This action did not select the file for moving and therefore did not directly bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. It did, however, clarify that a simple tap opens the file. To proceed, the agent needs to return to the file list and try a different interaction to select the file.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 41, 36, 133], \\'text\\': \\'15.41\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 66, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [73, 34, 100, 421], \\'text\\': \\'2023_02_13_sh.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [135, 35, 152, 432], \\'text\\': \\'ieCxOYI9DFvoucrkSPDY\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [936, 150, 964, 495], \\'text\\': \\'= B  I\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 950, 973, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 596, 971, 698]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 365, 970, 457]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 249, 970, 342]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 717, 971, 814]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [928, 124, 972, 231]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 908, 100, 985]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [930, 835, 971, 931]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 822, 37, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 483, 971, 573]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 140, 37, 189]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 811, 102, 897]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 617, 100, 702]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 38, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 713, 100, 799]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 9, 972, 105]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [985, 361, 1000, 634]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 517, 99, 609]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 904, 37, 944]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[201,469],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file named \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" (center coordinates [201, 469]). This is predicted to select the file and open a context menu or enable a selection mode, which should allow for a \\'move\\' operation. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the file \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" at coordinates [201, 469] did not result in any visible change on the screen. The file was not highlighted, no checkmark appeared, and no context menu was displayed. Therefore, the file was not selected. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top-right of the screen (approximate coordinates [83, 945]). This is predicted to open a menu with options, potentially including a \\'Select\\' or \\'Move\\' option, which will help in selecting and moving the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon (located at the top-right, approximate coordinates [83, 945] based on the red ring in the first image) was successful in opening a menu. The menu appeared at the top right of the screen and contains the options \"Import from device\" and \"Settings\". These options do not help with selecting the file \"shy_king_copy.md\" for moving. Therefore, this action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of selecting the note. The opened menu needs to be closed before another attempt to select the file can be made.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to close the currently open menu (\\'Import from device\\', \\'Settings\\'). This is predicted to return the screen to the file list view without the menu, allowing for interaction with the files themselves. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action was successful. The menu (\"Import from device\", \"Settings\") that was previously open at the top right of the screen is now closed. The screen displays the list of files within the \"StudyGuides\" folder. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by clearing the overlaying menu, allowing for further interaction with the files to select the target note.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[200,79],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file icon associated with \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\", located approximately at [200, 79]. This is predicted to select the file, potentially highlighting it or opening a context menu with options like \\'Move\\'. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the file icon for \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" at [200, 79] was unsuccessful in selecting the file. The screen remained unchanged, with no indication that the file was selected (e.g., no highlighting, checkmark, or context menu). This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of selecting the note. A different interaction method is required.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[201,469],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file named \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" (center coordinates [201, 469]). This is predicted to either open the file for editing or select it. If it opens for editing, the next step will be to press back. If it selects the file, the next step will be to look for a move option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the file named \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" (center coordinates [201, 469]) resulted in the file being opened for editing. The screen changed from the file list view to the editor view, displaying the content of the note. This action did not select the file for moving and therefore did not directly bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. It did, however, clarify that a simple tap opens the file. To proceed, the agent needs to return to the file list and try a different interaction to select the file.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 8: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to exit the editor view and return to the file list view. This is predicted to show the list of files in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, allowing for further actions to select the note. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top-right of the screen (approximate coordinates [83, 945]). This is predicted to open a menu with options, potentially including a \\'Select\\' or \\'Move\\' option, which will help in selecting and moving the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon (located at the top-right, approximate coordinates [83, 945] based on the red ring in the first image) was successful in opening a menu. The menu appeared at the top right of the screen and contains the options \"Import from device\" and \"Settings\". These options do not help with selecting the file \"shy_king_copy.md\" for moving. Therefore, this action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of selecting the note. The opened menu needs to be closed before another attempt to select the file can be made.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to close the currently open menu (\\'Import from device\\', \\'Settings\\'). This is predicted to return the screen to the file list view without the menu, allowing for interaction with the files themselves. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action was successful. The menu (\"Import from device\", \"Settings\") that was previously open at the top right of the screen is now closed. The screen displays the list of files within the \"StudyGuides\" folder. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by clearing the overlaying menu, allowing for further interaction with the files to select the target note.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[200,79],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file icon associated with \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\", located approximately at [200, 79]. This is predicted to select the file, potentially highlighting it or opening a context menu with options like \\'Move\\'. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the file icon for \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" at [200, 79] was unsuccessful in selecting the file. The screen remained unchanged, with no indication that the file was selected (e.g., no highlighting, checkmark, or context menu). This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of selecting the note. A different interaction method is required.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[201,469],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file named \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" (center coordinates [201, 469]). This is predicted to either open the file for editing or select it. If it opens for editing, the next step will be to press back. If it selects the file, the next step will be to look for a move option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the file named \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" (center coordinates [201, 469]) resulted in the file being opened for editing. The screen changed from the file list view to the editor view, displaying the content of the note. This action did not select the file for moving and therefore did not directly bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. It did, however, clarify that a simple tap opens the file. To proceed, the agent needs to return to the file list and try a different interaction to select the file.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to exit the editor view and return to the file list view. This is predicted to show the list of files in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, allowing for further actions to select the note. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action was successful. The note editor view was closed, and the screen returned to the file list view within the \"StudyGuides\" folder.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top-right of the screen (approximate coordinates [83, 945]). This is predicted to open a menu with options, potentially including a \\'Select\\' or \\'Move\\' option, which will help in selecting and moving the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon (located at the top-right, approximate coordinates [83, 945] based on the red ring in the first image) was successful in opening a menu. The menu appeared at the top right of the screen and contains the options \"Import from device\" and \"Settings\". These options do not help with selecting the file \"shy_king_copy.md\" for moving. Therefore, this action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of selecting the note. The opened menu needs to be closed before another attempt to select the file can be made.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to close the currently open menu (\\'Import from device\\', \\'Settings\\'). This is predicted to return the screen to the file list view without the menu, allowing for interaction with the files themselves. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action was successful. The menu (\"Import from device\", \"Settings\") that was previously open at the top right of the screen is now closed. The screen displays the list of files within the \"StudyGuides\" folder. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by clearing the overlaying menu, allowing for further interaction with the files to select the target note.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[200,79],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file icon associated with \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\", located approximately at [200, 79]. This is predicted to select the file, potentially highlighting it or opening a context menu with options like \\'Move\\'. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the file icon for \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" at [200, 79] was unsuccessful in selecting the file. The screen remained unchanged, with no indication that the file was selected (e.g., no highlighting, checkmark, or context menu). This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of selecting the note. A different interaction method is required.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[201,469],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file named \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" (center coordinates [201, 469]). This is predicted to either open the file for editing or select it. If it opens for editing, the next step will be to press back. If it selects the file, the next step will be to look for a move option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the file named \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" (center coordinates [201, 469]) resulted in the file being opened for editing. The screen changed from the file list view to the editor view, displaying the content of the note. This action did not select the file for moving and therefore did not directly bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. It did, however, clarify that a simple tap opens the file. To proceed, the agent needs to return to the file list and try a different interaction to select the file.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to exit the editor view and return to the file list view. This is predicted to show the list of files in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, allowing for further actions to select the note. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action was successful. The note editor view was closed, and the screen returned to the file list view within the \"StudyGuides\" folder. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing further attempts to select the note from the file list.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 9: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,876],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"More\" option in the bottom navigation bar, located at approximately [959, 876]. This is predicted to open a menu or reveal options that might include a way to select or move files. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution.

This is predicted to return the screen to the file list view without the menu, allowing for interaction with the files themselves. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action was successful. The menu (\"Import from device\", \"Settings\") that was previously open at the top right of the screen is now closed. The screen displays the list of files within the \"StudyGuides\" folder. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by clearing the overlaying menu, allowing for further interaction with the files to select the target note.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[200,79],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file icon associated with \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\", located approximately at [200, 79]. This is predicted to select the file, potentially highlighting it or opening a context menu with options like \\'Move\\'. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the file icon for \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" at [200, 79] was unsuccessful in selecting the file. The screen remained unchanged, with no indication that the file was selected (e.g., no highlighting, checkmark, or context menu). This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of selecting the note. A different interaction method is required.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[201,469],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file named \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" (center coordinates [201, 469]). This is predicted to either open the file for editing or select it. If it opens for editing, the next step will be to press back. If it selects the file, the next step will be to look for a move option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the file named \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" (center coordinates [201, 469]) resulted in the file being opened for editing. The screen changed from the file list view to the editor view, displaying the content of the note. This action did not select the file for moving and therefore did not directly bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. It did, however, clarify that a simple tap opens the file. To proceed, the agent needs to return to the file list and try a different interaction to select the file.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to exit the editor view and return to the file list view. This is predicted to show the list of files in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, allowing for further actions to select the note. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action was successful. The note editor view was closed, and the screen returned to the file list view within the \"StudyGuides\" folder. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing further attempts to select the note from the file list.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,876],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"More\" option in the bottom navigation bar, located at approximately [959, 876]. This is predicted to open a menu or reveal options that might include a way to select or move files. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \"More\" option in the bottom navigation bar (approximate coordinates [959, 876]) successfully opened the \"More\" screen. This screen displays various app-related options such as \"Rate this app\", \"Settings\", \"Help / FAQ\", etc. It does not provide any functionality for selecting or moving files. Therefore, this action did not help in progressing towards selecting the note \"shy_king_copy.md\". To proceed, the agent needs to return to the file list view.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nIn Markor, move the note shy_king_copy.md from StudyGuides to MeetingMinutes.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to close the currently open menu (\\'Import from device\\', \\'Settings\\'). This is predicted to return the screen to the file list view without the menu, allowing for interaction with the files themselves. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action was successful. The menu (\"Import from device\", \"Settings\") that was previously open at the top right of the screen is now closed. The screen displays the list of files within the \"StudyGuides\" folder. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by clearing the overlaying menu, allowing for further interaction with the files to select the target note.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[200,79],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file icon associated with \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\", located approximately at [200, 79]. This is predicted to select the file, potentially highlighting it or opening a context menu with options like \\'Move\\'. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the file icon for \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" at [200, 79] was unsuccessful in selecting the file. The screen remained unchanged, with no indication that the file was selected (e.g., no highlighting, checkmark, or context menu). This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of selecting the note. A different interaction method is required.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[201,469],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file named \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" (center coordinates [201, 469]). This is predicted to either open the file for editing or select it. If it opens for editing, the next step will be to press back. If it selects the file, the next step will be to look for a move option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the file named \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" (center coordinates [201, 469]) resulted in the file being opened for editing. The screen changed from the file list view to the editor view, displaying the content of the note. This action did not select the file for moving and therefore did not directly bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. It did, however, clarify that a simple tap opens the file. To proceed, the agent needs to return to the file list and try a different interaction to select the file.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to exit the editor view and return to the file list view. This is predicted to show the list of files in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, allowing for further actions to select the note. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action was successful. The note editor view was closed, and the screen returned to the file list view within the \"StudyGuides\" folder. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing further attempts to select the note from the file list.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,876],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"More\" option in the bottom navigation bar, located at approximately [959, 876]. This is predicted to open a menu or reveal options that might include a way to select or move files. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \"More\" option in the bottom navigation bar (approximate coordinates [959, 876]) successfully opened the \"More\" screen. This screen displays various app-related options such as \"Rate this app\", \"Settings\", \"Help / FAQ\", etc. It does not provide any functionality for selecting or moving files. Therefore, this action did not help in progressing towards selecting the note \"shy_king_copy.md\". To proceed, the agent needs to return to the file list view.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 10: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to navigate from the current \"More\" screen back to the previous screen, which should be the file list view within the \"StudyGuides\" folder. This will allow further attempts to select the target note. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[200,79],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file icon associated with \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\", located approximately at [200, 79]. This is predicted to select the file, potentially highlighting it or opening a context menu with options like \\'Move\\'. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the file icon for \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" at [200, 79] was unsuccessful in selecting the file. The screen remained unchanged, with no indication that the file was selected (e.g., no highlighting, checkmark, or context menu). This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of selecting the note. A different interaction method is required.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[201,469],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file named \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" (center coordinates [201, 469]). This is predicted to either open the file for editing or select it. If it opens for editing, the next step will be to press back. If it selects the file, the next step will be to look for a move option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the file named \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" (center coordinates [201, 469]) resulted in the file being opened for editing. The screen changed from the file list view to the editor view, displaying the content of the note. This action did not select the file for moving and therefore did not directly bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. It did, however, clarify that a simple tap opens the file. To proceed, the agent needs to return to the file list and try a different interaction to select the file.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to exit the editor view and return to the file list view. This is predicted to show the list of files in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, allowing for further actions to select the note. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action was successful. The note editor view was closed, and the screen returned to the file list view within the \"StudyGuides\" folder. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing further attempts to select the note from the file list.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,876],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"More\" option in the bottom navigation bar, located at approximately [959, 876]. This is predicted to open a menu or reveal options that might include a way to select or move files. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \"More\" option in the bottom navigation bar (approximate coordinates [959, 876]) successfully opened the \"More\" screen. This screen displays various app-related options such as \"Rate this app\", \"Settings\", \"Help / FAQ\", etc. It does not provide any functionality for selecting or moving files. Therefore, this action did not help in progressing towards selecting the note \"shy_king_copy.md\". To proceed, the agent needs to return to the file list view.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to navigate from the current \"More\" screen back to the previous screen, which should be the file list view within the \"StudyGuides\" folder. This will allow further attempts to select the target note. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action was intended to navigate from the \"More\" screen back to the file list view. However, the screen remained unchanged, still displaying the \"More\" screen. This means the action was not effective in returning to the previous screen. The agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal of selecting the note.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[200,79],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file icon associated with \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\", located approximately at [200, 79]. This is predicted to select the file, potentially highlighting it or opening a context menu with options like \\'Move\\'. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the file icon for \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" at [200, 79] was unsuccessful in selecting the file. The screen remained unchanged, with no indication that the file was selected (e.g., no highlighting, checkmark, or context menu). This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of selecting the note. A different interaction method is required.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[201,469],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file named \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" (center coordinates [201, 469]). This is predicted to either open the file for editing or select it. If it opens for editing, the next step will be to press back. If it selects the file, the next step will be to look for a move option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the file named \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" (center coordinates [201, 469]) resulted in the file being opened for editing. The screen changed from the file list view to the editor view, displaying the content of the note. This action did not select the file for moving and therefore did not directly bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. It did, however, clarify that a simple tap opens the file. To proceed, the agent needs to return to the file list and try a different interaction to select the file.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to exit the editor view and return to the file list view. This is predicted to show the list of files in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, allowing for further actions to select the note. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action was successful. The note editor view was closed, and the screen returned to the file list view within the \"StudyGuides\" folder. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing further attempts to select the note from the file list.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,876],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"More\" option in the bottom navigation bar, located at approximately [959, 876]. This is predicted to open a menu or reveal options that might include a way to select or move files. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \"More\" option in the bottom navigation bar (approximate coordinates [959, 876]) successfully opened the \"More\" screen. This screen displays various app-related options such as \"Rate this app\", \"Settings\", \"Help / FAQ\", etc. It does not provide any functionality for selecting or moving files. Therefore, this action did not help in progressing towards selecting the note \"shy_king_copy.md\". To proceed, the agent needs to return to the file list view.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to navigate from the current \"More\" screen back to the previous screen, which should be the file list view within the \"StudyGuides\" folder. This will allow further attempts to select the target note. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action was intended to navigate from the \"More\" screen back to the file list view. However, the screen remained unchanged, still displaying the \"More\" screen. This means the action was not effective in returning to the previous screen. The agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal of selecting the note. To proceed, the agent needs to find an alternative way to return to the file list, such as tapping the \"Files\" tab in the bottom navigation bar.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 11: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,125],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Files\" option in the bottom navigation bar, located at approximately [959, 125]. This is predicted to navigate the app from the current \"More\" screen back to the file list view, which is necessary to continue with selecting the note. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[201,469],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file named \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" (center coordinates [201, 469]). This is predicted to either open the file for editing or select it. If it opens for editing, the next step will be to press back. If it selects the file, the next step will be to look for a move option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the file named \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" (center coordinates [201, 469]) resulted in the file being opened for editing. The screen changed from the file list view to the editor view, displaying the content of the note. This action did not select the file for moving and therefore did not directly bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. It did, however, clarify that a simple tap opens the file. To proceed, the agent needs to return to the file list and try a different interaction to select the file.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to exit the editor view and return to the file list view. This is predicted to show the list of files in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, allowing for further actions to select the note. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action was successful. The note editor view was closed, and the screen returned to the file list view within the \"StudyGuides\" folder. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing further attempts to select the note from the file list.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,876],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"More\" option in the bottom navigation bar, located at approximately [959, 876]. This is predicted to open a menu or reveal options that might include a way to select or move files. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \"More\" option in the bottom navigation bar (approximate coordinates [959, 876]) successfully opened the \"More\" screen. This screen displays various app-related options such as \"Rate this app\", \"Settings\", \"Help / FAQ\", etc. It does not provide any functionality for selecting or moving files. Therefore, this action did not help in progressing towards selecting the note \"shy_king_copy.md\". To proceed, the agent needs to return to the file list view.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to navigate from the current \"More\" screen back to the previous screen, which should be the file list view within the \"StudyGuides\" folder. This will allow further attempts to select the target note. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action was intended to navigate from the \"More\" screen back to the file list view. However, the screen remained unchanged, still displaying the \"More\" screen. This means the action was not effective in returning to the previous screen. The agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal of selecting the note. To proceed, the agent needs to find an alternative way to return to the file list, such as tapping the \"Files\" tab in the bottom navigation bar.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,125],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Files\" option in the bottom navigation bar, located at approximately [959, 125]. This is predicted to navigate the app from the current \"More\" screen back to the file list view, which is necessary to continue with selecting the note. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \"Files\" option in the bottom navigation bar (coordinates were [959, 125] in the previous screen, but the actual tap was on the \\'Files\\' tab which is at the bottom left, around [959, 125] was likely a typo in the previous step\\'s predicted coordinates, the actual coordinates for \\'Files\\' tab are closer to [958, 125] or [952, 90] based on the text detection in the first screenshot) successfully navigated the app from the \"More\" screen back to the \"StudyGuides\" file list view. The screen now displays the contents of the \"StudyGuides\" folder. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by returning to the necessary screen to select the note.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[201,469],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file named \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" (center coordinates [201, 469]). This is predicted to either open the file for editing or select it. If it opens for editing, the next step will be to press back. If it selects the file, the next step will be to look for a move option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the file named \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" (center coordinates [201, 469]) resulted in the file being opened for editing. The screen changed from the file list view to the editor view, displaying the content of the note. This action did not select the file for moving and therefore did not directly bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. It did, however, clarify that a simple tap opens the file. To proceed, the agent needs to return to the file list and try a different interaction to select the file.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to exit the editor view and return to the file list view. This is predicted to show the list of files in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, allowing for further actions to select the note. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action was successful. The note editor view was closed, and the screen returned to the file list view within the \"StudyGuides\" folder. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing further attempts to select the note from the file list.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,876],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"More\" option in the bottom navigation bar, located at approximately [959, 876]. This is predicted to open a menu or reveal options that might include a way to select or move files. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \"More\" option in the bottom navigation bar (approximate coordinates [959, 876]) successfully opened the \"More\" screen. This screen displays various app-related options such as \"Rate this app\", \"Settings\", \"Help / FAQ\", etc. It does not provide any functionality for selecting or moving files. Therefore, this action did not help in progressing towards selecting the note \"shy_king_copy.md\". To proceed, the agent needs to return to the file list view.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to navigate from the current \"More\" screen back to the previous screen, which should be the file list view within the \"StudyGuides\" folder. This will allow further attempts to select the target note. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action was intended to navigate from the \"More\" screen back to the file list view. However, the screen remained unchanged, still displaying the \"More\" screen. This means the action was not effective in returning to the previous screen. The agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal of selecting the note. To proceed, the agent needs to find an alternative way to return to the file list, such as tapping the \"Files\" tab in the bottom navigation bar.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,125],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Files\" option in the bottom navigation bar, located at approximately [959, 125]. This is predicted to navigate the app from the current \"More\" screen back to the file list view, which is necessary to continue with selecting the note. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \"Files\" option in the bottom navigation bar (coordinates were [959, 125] in the previous screen, but the actual tap was on the \\'Files\\' tab which is at the bottom left, around [959, 125] was likely a typo in the previous step\\'s predicted coordinates, the actual coordinates for \\'Files\\' tab are closer to [958, 125] or [952, 90] based on the text detection in the first screenshot) successfully navigated the app from the \"More\" screen back to the \"StudyGuides\" file list view. The screen now displays the contents of the \"StudyGuides\" folder. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by returning to the necessary screen to select the note.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 12: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[201,469],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the file named \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" (center coordinates [201, 469]). This is predicted to select the file or open a context menu with options like \"Move\", \"Delete\", etc. If the file is selected, the next step will be to find and tap the \"Move\" option. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is predicted to show the list of files in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, allowing for further actions to select the note. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action was successful. The note editor view was closed, and the screen returned to the file list view within the \"StudyGuides\" folder. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing further attempts to select the note from the file list.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,876],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"More\" option in the bottom navigation bar, located at approximately [959, 876]. This is predicted to open a menu or reveal options that might include a way to select or move files. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \"More\" option in the bottom navigation bar (approximate coordinates [959, 876]) successfully opened the \"More\" screen. This screen displays various app-related options such as \"Rate this app\", \"Settings\", \"Help / FAQ\", etc. It does not provide any functionality for selecting or moving files. Therefore, this action did not help in progressing towards selecting the note \"shy_king_copy.md\". To proceed, the agent needs to return to the file list view.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to navigate from the current \"More\" screen back to the previous screen, which should be the file list view within the \"StudyGuides\" folder. This will allow further attempts to select the target note. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action was intended to navigate from the \"More\" screen back to the file list view. However, the screen remained unchanged, still displaying the \"More\" screen. This means the action was not effective in returning to the previous screen. The agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal of selecting the note. To proceed, the agent needs to find an alternative way to return to the file list, such as tapping the \"Files\" tab in the bottom navigation bar.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,125],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Files\" option in the bottom navigation bar, located at approximately [959, 125]. This is predicted to navigate the app from the current \"More\" screen back to the file list view, which is necessary to continue with selecting the note. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \"Files\" option in the bottom navigation bar (coordinates were [959, 125] in the previous screen, but the actual tap was on the \\'Files\\' tab which is at the bottom left, around [959, 125] was likely a typo in the previous step\\'s predicted coordinates, the actual coordinates for \\'Files\\' tab are closer to [958, 125] or [952, 90] based on the text detection in the first screenshot) successfully navigated the app from the \"More\" screen back to the \"StudyGuides\" file list view. The screen now displays the contents of the \"StudyGuides\" folder. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by returning to the necessary screen to select the note.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[201,469],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the file named \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" (center coordinates [201, 469]). This is predicted to select the file or open a context menu with options like \"Move\", \"Delete\", etc. If the file is selected, the next step will be to find and tap the \"Move\" option. Actual Outcome: The long press action on the file \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" was successful. The file is now selected, as indicated by a red checkmark next to its name. Additionally, the top action bar changed, displaying contextual icons (star, AI, info, trash, three-dot menu) instead of the folder title. This action brought the agent significantly closer to completing the user instruction by successfully selecting the target file. The active subgoal \"Find and select the note \\\\\"shy_king_copy.md\\\\\"\" is now complete.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is predicted to show the list of files in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, allowing for further actions to select the note. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action was successful. The note editor view was closed, and the screen returned to the file list view within the \"StudyGuides\" folder. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing further attempts to select the note from the file list.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

This is predicted to open a menu or reveal options that might include a way to select or move files. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \"More\" option in the bottom navigation bar (approximate coordinates [959, 876]) successfully opened the \"More\" screen. This screen displays various app-related options such as \"Rate this app\", \"Settings\", \"Help / FAQ\", etc. It does not provide any functionality for selecting or moving files. Therefore, this action did not help in progressing towards selecting the note \"shy_king_copy.md\". To proceed, the agent needs to return to the file list view.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to navigate from the current \"More\" screen back to the previous screen, which should be the file list view within the \"StudyGuides\" folder. This will allow further attempts to select the target note. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action was intended to navigate from the \"More\" screen back to the file list view. However, the screen remained unchanged, still displaying the \"More\" screen. This means the action was not effective in returning to the previous screen. The agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal of selecting the note. To proceed, the agent needs to find an alternative way to return to the file list, such as tapping the \"Files\" tab in the bottom navigation bar.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,125],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Files\" option in the bottom navigation bar, located at approximately [959, 125]. This is predicted to navigate the app from the current \"More\" screen back to the file list view, which is necessary to continue with selecting the note. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \"Files\" option in the bottom navigation bar (coordinates were [959, 125] in the previous screen, but the actual tap was on the \\'Files\\' tab which is at the bottom left, around [959, 125] was likely a typo in the previous step\\'s predicted coordinates, the actual coordinates for \\'Files\\' tab are closer to [958, 125] or [952, 90] based on the text detection in the first screenshot) successfully navigated the app from the \"More\" screen back to the \"StudyGuides\" file list view. The screen now displays the contents of the \"StudyGuides\" folder. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by returning to the necessary screen to select the note.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[201,469],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the file named \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" (center coordinates [201, 469]). This is predicted to select the file or open a context menu with options like \"Move\", \"Delete\", etc. If the file is selected, the next step will be to find and tap the \"Move\" option. Actual Outcome: The long press action on the file \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" was successful. The file is now selected, as indicated by a red checkmark next to its name. Additionally, the top action bar changed, displaying contextual icons (star, AI, info, trash, three-dot menu) instead of the folder title. This action brought the agent significantly closer to completing the user instruction by successfully selecting the target file. The active subgoal \"Find and select the note \\\\\"shy_king_copy.md\\\\\"\" is now complete.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 13: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,944],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon, located at approximately [83, 944] in the top action bar. This is predicted to open a context menu containing options for the selected file, including a \"Move\" or \"Move to\" option. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,876],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"More\" option in the bottom navigation bar, located at approximately [959, 876]. This is predicted to open a menu or reveal options that might include a way to select or move files. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \"More\" option in the bottom navigation bar (approximate coordinates [959, 876]) successfully opened the \"More\" screen. This screen displays various app-related options such as \"Rate this app\", \"Settings\", \"Help / FAQ\", etc. It does not provide any functionality for selecting or moving files. Therefore, this action did not help in progressing towards selecting the note \"shy_king_copy.md\". To proceed, the agent needs to return to the file list view.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to navigate from the current \"More\" screen back to the previous screen, which should be the file list view within the \"StudyGuides\" folder. This will allow further attempts to select the target note. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action was intended to navigate from the \"More\" screen back to the file list view. However, the screen remained unchanged, still displaying the \"More\" screen. This means the action was not effective in returning to the previous screen. The agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal of selecting the note. To proceed, the agent needs to find an alternative way to return to the file list, such as tapping the \"Files\" tab in the bottom navigation bar.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,125],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Files\" option in the bottom navigation bar, located at approximately [959, 125]. This is predicted to navigate the app from the current \"More\" screen back to the file list view, which is necessary to continue with selecting the note. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \"Files\" option in the bottom navigation bar (coordinates were [959, 125] in the previous screen, but the actual tap was on the \\'Files\\' tab which is at the bottom left, around [959, 125] was likely a typo in the previous step\\'s predicted coordinates, the actual coordinates for \\'Files\\' tab are closer to [958, 125] or [952, 90] based on the text detection in the first screenshot) successfully navigated the app from the \"More\" screen back to the \"StudyGuides\" file list view. The screen now displays the contents of the \"StudyGuides\" folder. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by returning to the necessary screen to select the note.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[201,469],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the file named \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" (center coordinates [201, 469]). This is predicted to select the file or open a context menu with options like \"Move\", \"Delete\", etc. If the file is selected, the next step will be to find and tap the \"Move\" option. Actual Outcome: The long press action on the file \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" was successful. The file is now selected, as indicated by a red checkmark next to its name. Additionally, the top action bar changed, displaying contextual icons (star, AI, info, trash, three-dot menu) instead of the folder title. This action brought the agent significantly closer to completing the user instruction by successfully selecting the target file. The active subgoal \"Find and select the note \\\\\"shy_king_copy.md\\\\\"\" is now complete.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,944],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon, located at approximately [83, 944] in the top action bar. This is predicted to open a context menu containing options for the selected file, including a \"Move\" or \"Move to\" option. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping the three-dot menu icon (predicted coordinates [83, 944]), successfully opened a context menu. This menu displays several options for the selected file: \"Clipboard\", \"Move\", \"Copy\", \"Create shortcut\", and \"Share\".

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,876],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"More\" option in the bottom navigation bar, located at approximately [959, 876]. This is predicted to open a menu or reveal options that might include a way to select or move files. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \"More\" option in the bottom navigation bar (approximate coordinates [959, 876]) successfully opened the \"More\" screen. This screen displays various app-related options such as \"Rate this app\", \"Settings\", \"Help / FAQ\", etc. It does not provide any functionality for selecting or moving files. Therefore, this action did not help in progressing towards selecting the note \"shy_king_copy.md\". To proceed, the agent needs to return to the file list view.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to navigate from the current \"More\" screen back to the previous screen, which should be the file list view within the \"StudyGuides\" folder. This will allow further attempts to select the target note. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action was intended to navigate from the \"More\" screen back to the file list view. However, the screen remained unchanged, still displaying the \"More\" screen. This means the action was not effective in returning to the previous screen. The agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal of selecting the note. To proceed, the agent needs to find an alternative way to return to the file list, such as tapping the \"Files\" tab in the bottom navigation bar.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,125],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Files\" option in the bottom navigation bar, located at approximately [959, 125]. This is predicted to navigate the app from the current \"More\" screen back to the file list view, which is necessary to continue with selecting the note. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \"Files\" option in the bottom navigation bar (coordinates were [959, 125] in the previous screen, but the actual tap was on the \\'Files\\' tab which is at the bottom left, around [959, 125] was likely a typo in the previous step\\'s predicted coordinates, the actual coordinates for \\'Files\\' tab are closer to [958, 125] or [952, 90] based on the text detection in the first screenshot) successfully navigated the app from the \"More\" screen back to the \"StudyGuides\" file list view. The screen now displays the contents of the \"StudyGuides\" folder. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by returning to the necessary screen to select the note.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[201,469],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the file named \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" (center coordinates [201, 469]). This is predicted to select the file or open a context menu with options like \"Move\", \"Delete\", etc. If the file is selected, the next step will be to find and tap the \"Move\" option. Actual Outcome: The long press action on the file \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" was successful. The file is now selected, as indicated by a red checkmark next to its name. Additionally, the top action bar changed, displaying contextual icons (star, AI, info, trash, three-dot menu) instead of the folder title. This action brought the agent significantly closer to completing the user instruction by successfully selecting the target file. The active subgoal \"Find and select the note \\\\\"shy_king_copy.md\\\\\"\" is now complete.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,944],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon, located at approximately [83, 944] in the top action bar. This is predicted to open a context menu containing options for the selected file, including a \"Move\" or \"Move to\" option. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping the three-dot menu icon (predicted coordinates [83, 944]), successfully opened a context menu. This menu displays several options for the selected file: \"Clipboard\", \"Move\", \"Copy\", \"Create shortcut\", and \"Share\". This outcome is positive and directly progresses towards completing the active subgoal, as the \"Move\" option is now visible and accessible.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 14: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[137,659],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Move\" option in the context menu, located at approximately [137, 659]. This is predicted to initiate the move operation, likely by opening a folder selection screen or dialog where the destination folder can be chosen. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This will allow further attempts to select the target note. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action was intended to navigate from the \"More\" screen back to the file list view. However, the screen remained unchanged, still displaying the \"More\" screen. This means the action was not effective in returning to the previous screen. The agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal of selecting the note. To proceed, the agent needs to find an alternative way to return to the file list, such as tapping the \"Files\" tab in the bottom navigation bar.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,125],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Files\" option in the bottom navigation bar, located at approximately [959, 125]. This is predicted to navigate the app from the current \"More\" screen back to the file list view, which is necessary to continue with selecting the note. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \"Files\" option in the bottom navigation bar (coordinates were [959, 125] in the previous screen, but the actual tap was on the \\'Files\\' tab which is at the bottom left, around [959, 125] was likely a typo in the previous step\\'s predicted coordinates, the actual coordinates for \\'Files\\' tab are closer to [958, 125] or [952, 90] based on the text detection in the first screenshot) successfully navigated the app from the \"More\" screen back to the \"StudyGuides\" file list view. The screen now displays the contents of the \"StudyGuides\" folder. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by returning to the necessary screen to select the note.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[201,469],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the file named \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" (center coordinates [201, 469]). This is predicted to select the file or open a context menu with options like \"Move\", \"Delete\", etc. If the file is selected, the next step will be to find and tap the \"Move\" option. Actual Outcome: The long press action on the file \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" was successful. The file is now selected, as indicated by a red checkmark next to its name. Additionally, the top action bar changed, displaying contextual icons (star, AI, info, trash, three-dot menu) instead of the folder title. This action brought the agent significantly closer to completing the user instruction by successfully selecting the target file. The active subgoal \"Find and select the note \\\\\"shy_king_copy.md\\\\\"\" is now complete.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,944],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon, located at approximately [83, 944] in the top action bar. This is predicted to open a context menu containing options for the selected file, including a \"Move\" or \"Move to\" option. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping the three-dot menu icon (predicted coordinates [83, 944]), successfully opened a context menu. This menu displays several options for the selected file: \"Clipboard\", \"Move\", \"Copy\", \"Create shortcut\", and \"Share\". This outcome is positive and directly progresses towards completing the active subgoal, as the \"Move\" option is now visible and accessible.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[137,659],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Move\" option in the context menu, located at approximately [137, 659]. This is predicted to initiate the move operation, likely by opening a folder selection screen or dialog where the destination folder can be chosen. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \"Move\" option in the context menu successfully initiated the move operation. A new screen appeared, which is a folder selection dialog. The title of the screen is \"Move\", and it displays the current path as \"/storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\". Navigation options (home, parent directory \"..\") and confirmation buttons (\"CANCEL\", \"SELECT THIS FOLDER\") are available. This action directly progresses towards the user\\'s goal by opening the necessary interface to choose the destination folder. The active subgoal \"Initiate the move operation for the selected note\" is now completed.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 42, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.46\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [95, 78, 115, 201], \\'text\\': \\'1i\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [91, 264, 121, 555], \\'text\\': \\'onuohiunders\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [216, 178, 241, 858], \\'text\\': \\'Istorage/lemulated/0 /Documents/markor\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [912, 396, 928, 906], \\'text\\': \\'CANCEL SELECT THIS FOLDER\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [955, 106, 965, 161], \\'text\\': \\'1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [958, 353, 963, 412], \\'text\\': \\'UVU\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [955, 556, 965, 696], \\'text\\': \\'QuICKNOle\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [955, 838, 965, 911], \\'text\\': \\'IIore\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 822, 35, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 141, 36, 189]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 37, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 906, 36, 942]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [147, 855, 180, 931]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [909, 394, 930, 535]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [985, 363, 1000, 633]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [146, 67, 183, 145]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This will allow further attempts to select the target note. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action was intended to navigate from the \"More\" screen back to the file list view. However, the screen remained unchanged, still displaying the \"More\" screen. This means the action was not effective in returning to the previous screen. The agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal of selecting the note. To proceed, the agent needs to find an alternative way to return to the file list, such as tapping the \"Files\" tab in the bottom navigation bar.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,125],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Files\" option in the bottom navigation bar, located at approximately [959, 125]. This is predicted to navigate the app from the current \"More\" screen back to the file list view, which is necessary to continue with selecting the note. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \"Files\" option in the bottom navigation bar (coordinates were [959, 125] in the previous screen, but the actual tap was on the \\'Files\\' tab which is at the bottom left, around [959, 125] was likely a typo in the previous step\\'s predicted coordinates, the actual coordinates for \\'Files\\' tab are closer to [958, 125] or [952, 90] based on the text detection in the first screenshot) successfully navigated the app from the \"More\" screen back to the \"StudyGuides\" file list view. The screen now displays the contents of the \"StudyGuides\" folder. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by returning to the necessary screen to select the note.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[201,469],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the file named \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" (center coordinates [201, 469]). This is predicted to select the file or open a context menu with options like \"Move\", \"Delete\", etc. If the file is selected, the next step will be to find and tap the \"Move\" option. Actual Outcome: The long press action on the file \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" was successful. The file is now selected, as indicated by a red checkmark next to its name. Additionally, the top action bar changed, displaying contextual icons (star, AI, info, trash, three-dot menu) instead of the folder title. This action brought the agent significantly closer to completing the user instruction by successfully selecting the target file. The active subgoal \"Find and select the note \\\\\"shy_king_copy.md\\\\\"\" is now complete.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,944],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon, located at approximately [83, 944] in the top action bar. This is predicted to open a context menu containing options for the selected file, including a \"Move\" or \"Move to\" option. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping the three-dot menu icon (predicted coordinates [83, 944]), successfully opened a context menu. This menu displays several options for the selected file: \"Clipboard\", \"Move\", \"Copy\", \"Create shortcut\", and \"Share\". This outcome is positive and directly progresses towards completing the active subgoal, as the \"Move\" option is now visible and accessible.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[137,659],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Move\" option in the context menu, located at approximately [137, 659]. This is predicted to initiate the move operation, likely by opening a folder selection screen or dialog where the destination folder can be chosen. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \"Move\" option in the context menu successfully initiated the move operation. A new screen appeared, which is a folder selection dialog. The title of the screen is \"Move\", and it displays the current path as \"/storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\". Navigation options (home, parent directory \"..\") and confirmation buttons (\"CANCEL\", \"SELECT THIS FOLDER\") are available. This action directly progresses towards the user\\'s goal by opening the necessary interface to choose the destination folder. The active subgoal \"Initiate the move operation for the selected note\" is now completed.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 15: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[260,110],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'..\\' entry (folder icon) to navigate to the parent directory. The \\'..\\' entry is located below the current path display \\'/storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\\'. This action is predicted to change the current directory to \\'/storage/emulated/0/Documents/\\', allowing me to search for the \\'MeetingMinutes\\' folder there or to re-enter the \\'markor\\' folder if needed.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,125],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Files\" option in the bottom navigation bar, located at approximately [959, 125]. This is predicted to navigate the app from the current \"More\" screen back to the file list view, which is necessary to continue with selecting the note. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \"Files\" option in the bottom navigation bar (coordinates were [959, 125] in the previous screen, but the actual tap was on the \\'Files\\' tab which is at the bottom left, around [959, 125] was likely a typo in the previous step\\'s predicted coordinates, the actual coordinates for \\'Files\\' tab are closer to [958, 125] or [952, 90] based on the text detection in the first screenshot) successfully navigated the app from the \"More\" screen back to the \"StudyGuides\" file list view. The screen now displays the contents of the \"StudyGuides\" folder. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by returning to the necessary screen to select the note.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[201,469],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the file named \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" (center coordinates [201, 469]). This is predicted to select the file or open a context menu with options like \"Move\", \"Delete\", etc. If the file is selected, the next step will be to find and tap the \"Move\" option. Actual Outcome: The long press action on the file \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" was successful. The file is now selected, as indicated by a red checkmark next to its name. Additionally, the top action bar changed, displaying contextual icons (star, AI, info, trash, three-dot menu) instead of the folder title. This action brought the agent significantly closer to completing the user instruction by successfully selecting the target file. The active subgoal \"Find and select the note \\\\\"shy_king_copy.md\\\\\"\" is now complete.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,944],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon, located at approximately [83, 944] in the top action bar. This is predicted to open a context menu containing options for the selected file, including a \"Move\" or \"Move to\" option. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping the three-dot menu icon (predicted coordinates [83, 944]), successfully opened a context menu. This menu displays several options for the selected file: \"Clipboard\", \"Move\", \"Copy\", \"Create shortcut\", and \"Share\". This outcome is positive and directly progresses towards completing the active subgoal, as the \"Move\" option is now visible and accessible.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[137,659],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Move\" option in the context menu, located at approximately [137, 659]. This is predicted to initiate the move operation, likely by opening a folder selection screen or dialog where the destination folder can be chosen. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \"Move\" option in the context menu successfully initiated the move operation. A new screen appeared, which is a folder selection dialog. The title of the screen is \"Move\", and it displays the current path as \"/storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\". Navigation options (home, parent directory \"..\") and confirmation buttons (\"CANCEL\", \"SELECT THIS FOLDER\") are available. This action directly progresses towards the user\\'s goal by opening the necessary interface to choose the destination folder. The active subgoal \"Initiate the move operation for the selected note\" is now completed.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[260,110],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'..\\' entry (folder icon) to navigate to the parent directory. The \\'..\\' entry is located below the current path display \\'/storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\\'. This action is predicted to change the current directory to \\'/storage/emulated/0/Documents/\\', allowing me to search for the \\'MeetingMinutes\\' folder there or to re-enter the \\'markor\\' folder if needed. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [260, 110] was intended to tap the \\'..\\' (parent directory) option in the \"Move\" dialog. However, the tap occurred on an empty area below the actual \\'..\\' entry. Consequently, the screen remained unchanged, still displaying the \\'/storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\\' path. The action was a failure and did not bring the agent closer to selecting the \"MeetingMinutes\" folder. To proceed, the agent must tap the \\'..\\' entry at its correct location.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 41, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.49\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [95, 78, 115, 201], \\'text\\': \\'1i\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [91, 264, 121, 555], \\'text\\': \\'onuohiunders\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [216, 178, 241, 858], \\'text\\': \\'Istorage/lemulated/0 /Documents/markor\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [912, 396, 928, 906], \\'text\\': \\'CANCEL SELECT THIS FOLDER\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [955, 106, 965, 161], \\'text\\': \\'1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [958, 353, 963, 412], \\'text\\': \\'UVU\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [955, 556, 965, 696], \\'text\\': \\'QuICKNOle\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [955, 838, 965, 911], \\'text\\': \\'IIore\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 822, 35, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 140, 36, 189]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 37, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 906, 35, 941]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [148, 856, 180, 930]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [147, 69, 183, 144]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [909, 394, 930, 535]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [985, 363, 1000, 633]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [910, 563, 930, 906]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,125],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Files\" option in the bottom navigation bar, located at approximately [959, 125]. This is predicted to navigate the app from the current \"More\" screen back to the file list view, which is necessary to continue with selecting the note. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \"Files\" option in the bottom navigation bar (coordinates were [959, 125] in the previous screen, but the actual tap was on the \\'Files\\' tab which is at the bottom left, around [959, 125] was likely a typo in the previous step\\'s predicted coordinates, the actual coordinates for \\'Files\\' tab are closer to [958, 125] or [952, 90] based on the text detection in the first screenshot) successfully navigated the app from the \"More\" screen back to the \"StudyGuides\" file list view. The screen now displays the contents of the \"StudyGuides\" folder. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by returning to the necessary screen to select the note.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[201,469],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the file named \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" (center coordinates [201, 469]). This is predicted to select the file or open a context menu with options like \"Move\", \"Delete\", etc. If the file is selected, the next step will be to find and tap the \"Move\" option. Actual Outcome: The long press action on the file \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" was successful. The file is now selected, as indicated by a red checkmark next to its name. Additionally, the top action bar changed, displaying contextual icons (star, AI, info, trash, three-dot menu) instead of the folder title. This action brought the agent significantly closer to completing the user instruction by successfully selecting the target file. The active subgoal \"Find and select the note \\\\\"shy_king_copy.md\\\\\"\" is now complete.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,944],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon, located at approximately [83, 944] in the top action bar. This is predicted to open a context menu containing options for the selected file, including a \"Move\" or \"Move to\" option. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping the three-dot menu icon (predicted coordinates [83, 944]), successfully opened a context menu. This menu displays several options for the selected file: \"Clipboard\", \"Move\", \"Copy\", \"Create shortcut\", and \"Share\". This outcome is positive and directly progresses towards completing the active subgoal, as the \"Move\" option is now visible and accessible.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[137,659],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Move\" option in the context menu, located at approximately [137, 659]. This is predicted to initiate the move operation, likely by opening a folder selection screen or dialog where the destination folder can be chosen. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \"Move\" option in the context menu successfully initiated the move operation. A new screen appeared, which is a folder selection dialog. The title of the screen is \"Move\", and it displays the current path as \"/storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\". Navigation options (home, parent directory \"..\") and confirmation buttons (\"CANCEL\", \"SELECT THIS FOLDER\") are available. This action directly progresses towards the user\\'s goal by opening the necessary interface to choose the destination folder. The active subgoal \"Initiate the move operation for the selected note\" is now completed.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[260,110],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'..\\' entry (folder icon) to navigate to the parent directory. The \\'..\\' entry is located below the current path display \\'/storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\\'. This action is predicted to change the current directory to \\'/storage/emulated/0/Documents/\\', allowing me to search for the \\'MeetingMinutes\\' folder there or to re-enter the \\'markor\\' folder if needed. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [260, 110] was intended to tap the \\'..\\' (parent directory) option in the \"Move\" dialog. However, the tap occurred on an empty area below the actual \\'..\\' entry. Consequently, the screen remained unchanged, still displaying the \\'/storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\\' path. The action was a failure and did not bring the agent closer to selecting the \"MeetingMinutes\" folder. To proceed, the agent must tap the \\'..\\' entry at its correct location.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 16: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[200,110],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'..\\' (parent directory) entry, which is represented by a folder icon and two dots. This entry is located below the home icon and above the current path display. The estimated coordinates for the tap are [200, 110]. This action is predicted to navigate to the parent directory \\'/storage/emulated/0/Documents/\\', allowing the \\'MeetingMinutes\\' folder to be located. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below.

For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[201,469],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the file named \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" (center coordinates [201, 469]). This is predicted to select the file or open a context menu with options like \"Move\", \"Delete\", etc. If the file is selected, the next step will be to find and tap the \"Move\" option. Actual Outcome: The long press action on the file \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" was successful. The file is now selected, as indicated by a red checkmark next to its name. Additionally, the top action bar changed, displaying contextual icons (star, AI, info, trash, three-dot menu) instead of the folder title. This action brought the agent significantly closer to completing the user instruction by successfully selecting the target file. The active subgoal \"Find and select the note \\\\\"shy_king_copy.md\\\\\"\" is now complete.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,944],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon, located at approximately [83, 944] in the top action bar. This is predicted to open a context menu containing options for the selected file, including a \"Move\" or \"Move to\" option. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping the three-dot menu icon (predicted coordinates [83, 944]), successfully opened a context menu. This menu displays several options for the selected file: \"Clipboard\", \"Move\", \"Copy\", \"Create shortcut\", and \"Share\". This outcome is positive and directly progresses towards completing the active subgoal, as the \"Move\" option is now visible and accessible.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[137,659],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Move\" option in the context menu, located at approximately [137, 659]. This is predicted to initiate the move operation, likely by opening a folder selection screen or dialog where the destination folder can be chosen. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \"Move\" option in the context menu successfully initiated the move operation. A new screen appeared, which is a folder selection dialog. The title of the screen is \"Move\", and it displays the current path as \"/storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\". Navigation options (home, parent directory \"..\") and confirmation buttons (\"CANCEL\", \"SELECT THIS FOLDER\") are available. This action directly progresses towards the user\\'s goal by opening the necessary interface to choose the destination folder. The active subgoal \"Initiate the move operation for the selected note\" is now completed.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[260,110],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'..\\' entry (folder icon) to navigate to the parent directory. The \\'..\\' entry is located below the current path display \\'/storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\\'. This action is predicted to change the current directory to \\'/storage/emulated/0/Documents/\\', allowing me to search for the \\'MeetingMinutes\\' folder there or to re-enter the \\'markor\\' folder if needed. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [260, 110] was intended to tap the \\'..\\' (parent directory) option in the \"Move\" dialog. However, the tap occurred on an empty area below the actual \\'..\\' entry. Consequently, the screen remained unchanged, still displaying the \\'/storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\\' path. The action was a failure and did not bring the agent closer to selecting the \"MeetingMinutes\" folder. To proceed, the agent must tap the \\'..\\' entry at its correct location.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[200,110],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'..\\' (parent directory) entry, which is represented by a folder icon and two dots. This entry is located below the home icon and above the current path display. The estimated coordinates for the tap are [200, 110]. This action is predicted to navigate to the parent directory \\'/storage/emulated/0/Documents/\\', allowing the \\'MeetingMinutes\\' folder to be located. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [200, 110] on the \\'..\\' (parent directory) entry failed. The screen did not change, and the current path remains \"/storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\". The agent is not closer to selecting the \"MeetingMinutes\" folder. The action needs to be retried with more precise coordinates for the \\'..\\' entry.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.52\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [95, 78, 115, 201], \\'text\\': \\'1i\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [91, 264, 121, 555], \\'text\\': \\'onuohiunders\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [216, 178, 241, 858], \\'text\\': \\'Istorage/lemulated/0 /Documents/markor\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [912, 396, 928, 906], \\'text\\': \\'CANCEL SELECT THIS FOLDER\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [955, 106, 965, 161], \\'text\\': \\'1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [958, 353, 963, 412], \\'text\\': \\'UVU\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [955, 556, 965, 696], \\'text\\': \\'QuICKNOle\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [955, 838, 965, 911], \\'text\\': \\'IIore\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 822, 35, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 37, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 141, 36, 188]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 906, 36, 942]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [148, 856, 180, 930]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [909, 394, 930, 536]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [146, 67, 184, 145]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [985, 363, 1000, 633]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [294, 960, 353, 1000]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nIn Markor, move the note shy_king_copy.md from StudyGuides to MeetingMinutes.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[201,469],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the file named \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" (center coordinates [201, 469]). This is predicted to select the file or open a context menu with options like \"Move\", \"Delete\", etc. If the file is selected, the next step will be to find and tap the \"Move\" option. Actual Outcome: The long press action on the file \"2023_02_13_shy_king_copy.md\" was successful. The file is now selected, as indicated by a red checkmark next to its name. Additionally, the top action bar changed, displaying contextual icons (star, AI, info, trash, three-dot menu) instead of the folder title. This action brought the agent significantly closer to completing the user instruction by successfully selecting the target file. The active subgoal \"Find and select the note \\\\\"shy_king_copy.md\\\\\"\" is now complete.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,944],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon, located at approximately [83, 944] in the top action bar. This is predicted to open a context menu containing options for the selected file, including a \"Move\" or \"Move to\" option. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping the three-dot menu icon (predicted coordinates [83, 944]), successfully opened a context menu. This menu displays several options for the selected file: \"Clipboard\", \"Move\", \"Copy\", \"Create shortcut\", and \"Share\". This outcome is positive and directly progresses towards completing the active subgoal, as the \"Move\" option is now visible and accessible.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[137,659],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Move\" option in the context menu, located at approximately [137, 659]. This is predicted to initiate the move operation, likely by opening a folder selection screen or dialog where the destination folder can be chosen. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \"Move\" option in the context menu successfully initiated the move operation. A new screen appeared, which is a folder selection dialog. The title of the screen is \"Move\", and it displays the current path as \"/storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\". Navigation options (home, parent directory \"..\") and confirmation buttons (\"CANCEL\", \"SELECT THIS FOLDER\") are available. This action directly progresses towards the user\\'s goal by opening the necessary interface to choose the destination folder. The active subgoal \"Initiate the move operation for the selected note\" is now completed.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[260,110],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'..\\' entry (folder icon) to navigate to the parent directory. The \\'..\\' entry is located below the current path display \\'/storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\\'. This action is predicted to change the current directory to \\'/storage/emulated/0/Documents/\\', allowing me to search for the \\'MeetingMinutes\\' folder there or to re-enter the \\'markor\\' folder if needed. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [260, 110] was intended to tap the \\'..\\' (parent directory) option in the \"Move\" dialog. However, the tap occurred on an empty area below the actual \\'..\\' entry. Consequently, the screen remained unchanged, still displaying the \\'/storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\\' path. The action was a failure and did not bring the agent closer to selecting the \"MeetingMinutes\" folder. To proceed, the agent must tap the \\'..\\' entry at its correct location.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[200,110],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'..\\' (parent directory) entry, which is represented by a folder icon and two dots. This entry is located below the home icon and above the current path display. The estimated coordinates for the tap are [200, 110]. This action is predicted to navigate to the parent directory \\'/storage/emulated/0/Documents/\\', allowing the \\'MeetingMinutes\\' folder to be located. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [200, 110] on the \\'..\\' (parent directory) entry failed. The screen did not change, and the current path remains \"/storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\". The agent is not closer to selecting the \"MeetingMinutes\" folder. The action needs to be retried with more precise coordinates for the \\'..\\' entry.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 17: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[205,105],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the folder icon of the \"..\" (parent directory) entry, located at approximately [205, 105]. This is predicted to navigate to the parent directory \"/storage/emulated/0/Documents/\", which should allow locating the \"MeetingMinutes\" folder. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,944],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon, located at approximately [83, 944] in the top action bar. This is predicted to open a context menu containing options for the selected file, including a \"Move\" or \"Move to\" option. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping the three-dot menu icon (predicted coordinates [83, 944]), successfully opened a context menu. This menu displays several options for the selected file: \"Clipboard\", \"Move\", \"Copy\", \"Create shortcut\", and \"Share\". This outcome is positive and directly progresses towards completing the active subgoal, as the \"Move\" option is now visible and accessible.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[137,659],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Move\" option in the context menu, located at approximately [137, 659]. This is predicted to initiate the move operation, likely by opening a folder selection screen or dialog where the destination folder can be chosen. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \"Move\" option in the context menu successfully initiated the move operation. A new screen appeared, which is a folder selection dialog. The title of the screen is \"Move\", and it displays the current path as \"/storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\". Navigation options (home, parent directory \"..\") and confirmation buttons (\"CANCEL\", \"SELECT THIS FOLDER\") are available. This action directly progresses towards the user\\'s goal by opening the necessary interface to choose the destination folder. The active subgoal \"Initiate the move operation for the selected note\" is now completed.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[260,110],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'..\\' entry (folder icon) to navigate to the parent directory. The \\'..\\' entry is located below the current path display \\'/storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\\'. This action is predicted to change the current directory to \\'/storage/emulated/0/Documents/\\', allowing me to search for the \\'MeetingMinutes\\' folder there or to re-enter the \\'markor\\' folder if needed. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [260, 110] was intended to tap the \\'..\\' (parent directory) option in the \"Move\" dialog. However, the tap occurred on an empty area below the actual \\'..\\' entry. Consequently, the screen remained unchanged, still displaying the \\'/storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\\' path. The action was a failure and did not bring the agent closer to selecting the \"MeetingMinutes\" folder. To proceed, the agent must tap the \\'..\\' entry at its correct location.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[200,110],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'..\\' (parent directory) entry, which is represented by a folder icon and two dots. This entry is located below the home icon and above the current path display. The estimated coordinates for the tap are [200, 110]. This action is predicted to navigate to the parent directory \\'/storage/emulated/0/Documents/\\', allowing the \\'MeetingMinutes\\' folder to be located. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [200, 110] on the \\'..\\' (parent directory) entry failed. The screen did not change, and the current path remains \"/storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\". The agent is not closer to selecting the \"MeetingMinutes\" folder. The action needs to be retried with more precise coordinates for the \\'..\\' entry.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[205,105],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the folder icon of the \"..\" (parent directory) entry, located at approximately [205, 105]. This is predicted to navigate to the parent directory \"/storage/emulated/0/Documents/\", which should allow locating the \"MeetingMinutes\" folder. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [205, 105] on the folder icon of the \"..\" (parent directory) entry failed. The screen did not change, and the current path remains \"/storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\". The agent is not closer to selecting the \"MeetingMinutes\" folder. The action needs to be retried by tapping on the text \"..\" instead of the icon.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 43, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.54\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [95, 78, 115, 201], \\'text\\': \\'1i\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [91, 264, 121, 555], \\'text\\': \\'onuohiunders\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [216, 178, 241, 858], \\'text\\': \\'Istorage/lemulated/0 /Documents/markor\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [912, 396, 928, 906], \\'text\\': \\'CANCEL SELECT THIS FOLDER\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [955, 106, 965, 161], \\'text\\': \\'1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [958, 353, 963, 412], \\'text\\': \\'UVU\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [955, 556, 965, 696], \\'text\\': \\'QuICKNOle\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [955, 838, 965, 911], \\'text\\': \\'IIore\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 822, 35, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 906, 35, 941]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 38, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 143, 37, 190]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [147, 856, 180, 931]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [909, 394, 930, 536]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [985, 363, 1000, 633]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [147, 68, 183, 144]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [294, 960, 353, 1000]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,944],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon, located at approximately [83, 944] in the top action bar. This is predicted to open a context menu containing options for the selected file, including a \"Move\" or \"Move to\" option. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping the three-dot menu icon (predicted coordinates [83, 944]), successfully opened a context menu. This menu displays several options for the selected file: \"Clipboard\", \"Move\", \"Copy\", \"Create shortcut\", and \"Share\". This outcome is positive and directly progresses towards completing the active subgoal, as the \"Move\" option is now visible and accessible.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[137,659],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Move\" option in the context menu, located at approximately [137, 659]. This is predicted to initiate the move operation, likely by opening a folder selection screen or dialog where the destination folder can be chosen. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \"Move\" option in the context menu successfully initiated the move operation. A new screen appeared, which is a folder selection dialog. The title of the screen is \"Move\", and it displays the current path as \"/storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\". Navigation options (home, parent directory \"..\") and confirmation buttons (\"CANCEL\", \"SELECT THIS FOLDER\") are available. This action directly progresses towards the user\\'s goal by opening the necessary interface to choose the destination folder. The active subgoal \"Initiate the move operation for the selected note\" is now completed.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[260,110],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'..\\' entry (folder icon) to navigate to the parent directory. The \\'..\\' entry is located below the current path display \\'/storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\\'. This action is predicted to change the current directory to \\'/storage/emulated/0/Documents/\\', allowing me to search for the \\'MeetingMinutes\\' folder there or to re-enter the \\'markor\\' folder if needed. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [260, 110] was intended to tap the \\'..\\' (parent directory) option in the \"Move\" dialog. However, the tap occurred on an empty area below the actual \\'..\\' entry. Consequently, the screen remained unchanged, still displaying the \\'/storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\\' path. The action was a failure and did not bring the agent closer to selecting the \"MeetingMinutes\" folder. To proceed, the agent must tap the \\'..\\' entry at its correct location.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[200,110],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'..\\' (parent directory) entry, which is represented by a folder icon and two dots. This entry is located below the home icon and above the current path display. The estimated coordinates for the tap are [200, 110]. This action is predicted to navigate to the parent directory \\'/storage/emulated/0/Documents/\\', allowing the \\'MeetingMinutes\\' folder to be located. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [200, 110] on the \\'..\\' (parent directory) entry failed. The screen did not change, and the current path remains \"/storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\". The agent is not closer to selecting the \"MeetingMinutes\" folder. The action needs to be retried with more precise coordinates for the \\'..\\' entry.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[205,105],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the folder icon of the \"..\" (parent directory) entry, located at approximately [205, 105]. This is predicted to navigate to the parent directory \"/storage/emulated/0/Documents/\", which should allow locating the \"MeetingMinutes\" folder. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [205, 105] on the folder icon of the \"..\" (parent directory) entry failed. The screen did not change, and the current path remains \"/storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\". The agent is not closer to selecting the \"MeetingMinutes\" folder. The action needs to be retried by tapping on the text \"..\" instead of the icon.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 18: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[205,190],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \"..\" of the parent directory entry, located at approximately [205, 190]. This is predicted to navigate to the parent directory \"/storage/emulated/0/Documents/\", which should allow locating the \"MeetingMinutes\" folder. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[137,659],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Move\" option in the context menu, located at approximately [137, 659]. This is predicted to initiate the move operation, likely by opening a folder selection screen or dialog where the destination folder can be chosen. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \"Move\" option in the context menu successfully initiated the move operation. A new screen appeared, which is a folder selection dialog. The title of the screen is \"Move\", and it displays the current path as \"/storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\". Navigation options (home, parent directory \"..\") and confirmation buttons (\"CANCEL\", \"SELECT THIS FOLDER\") are available. This action directly progresses towards the user\\'s goal by opening the necessary interface to choose the destination folder. The active subgoal \"Initiate the move operation for the selected note\" is now completed.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[260,110],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'..\\' entry (folder icon) to navigate to the parent directory. The \\'..\\' entry is located below the current path display \\'/storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\\'. This action is predicted to change the current directory to \\'/storage/emulated/0/Documents/\\', allowing me to search for the \\'MeetingMinutes\\' folder there or to re-enter the \\'markor\\' folder if needed. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [260, 110] was intended to tap the \\'..\\' (parent directory) option in the \"Move\" dialog. However, the tap occurred on an empty area below the actual \\'..\\' entry. Consequently, the screen remained unchanged, still displaying the \\'/storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\\' path. The action was a failure and did not bring the agent closer to selecting the \"MeetingMinutes\" folder. To proceed, the agent must tap the \\'..\\' entry at its correct location.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[200,110],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'..\\' (parent directory) entry, which is represented by a folder icon and two dots. This entry is located below the home icon and above the current path display. The estimated coordinates for the tap are [200, 110]. This action is predicted to navigate to the parent directory \\'/storage/emulated/0/Documents/\\', allowing the \\'MeetingMinutes\\' folder to be located. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [200, 110] on the \\'..\\' (parent directory) entry failed. The screen did not change, and the current path remains \"/storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\". The agent is not closer to selecting the \"MeetingMinutes\" folder. The action needs to be retried with more precise coordinates for the \\'..\\' entry.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[205,105],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the folder icon of the \"..\" (parent directory) entry, located at approximately [205, 105]. This is predicted to navigate to the parent directory \"/storage/emulated/0/Documents/\", which should allow locating the \"MeetingMinutes\" folder. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [205, 105] on the folder icon of the \"..\" (parent directory) entry failed. The screen did not change, and the current path remains \"/storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\". The agent is not closer to selecting the \"MeetingMinutes\" folder. The action needs to be retried by tapping on the text \"..\" instead of the icon.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[205,190],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \"..\" of the parent directory entry, located at approximately [205, 190]. This is predicted to navigate to the parent directory \"/storage/emulated/0/Documents/\", which should allow locating the \"MeetingMinutes\" folder. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'..\\' entry at [205, 190] was successful. The folder selection dialog navigated to the parent directory, \\'/storage/emulated/0/Documents\\'. The list of folders now includes \\'.app\\', \\'MeetingMinutes\\', and \\'StudyGuides\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the \\'MeetingMinutes\\' folder is now accessible for selection.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 43, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.55\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [95, 78, 115, 201], \\'text\\': \\'1i\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [95, 269, 115, 433], \\'text\\': \\'1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [219, 179, 240, 727], \\'text\\': \\'Istorage/emulated/0/Documents\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [257, 178, 301, 858], \\'text\\': \\'app Istorage/lemulated/0 /Documents/markor\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [312, 178, 361, 858], \\'text\\': \\'MeetingMinutes Istorage/lemulated/0 /Documents/markor\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [372, 178, 421, 858], \\'text\\': \\'StudyGuides Istorage/lemulated/0 /Documents/markor\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [912, 396, 928, 906], \\'text\\': \\'CANCEL SELECT THIS FOLDER\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [955, 106, 965, 161], \\'text\\': \\'1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [957, 353, 963, 412], \\'text\\': \\'0-VO\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [955, 556, 965, 696], \\'text\\': \\'QuICKNOle\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [955, 838, 965, 911], \\'text\\': \\'IIore\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [250, 45, 310, 969]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [139, 50, 251, 964]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 822, 35, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 38, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 906, 35, 942]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 141, 37, 189]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [148, 856, 180, 931]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [985, 363, 1000, 633]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [909, 393, 930, 539]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [594, 960, 653, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [910, 562, 930, 905]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [534, 960, 593, 1000]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[137,659],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Move\" option in the context menu, located at approximately [137, 659]. This is predicted to initiate the move operation, likely by opening a folder selection screen or dialog where the destination folder can be chosen. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \"Move\" option in the context menu successfully initiated the move operation. A new screen appeared, which is a folder selection dialog. The title of the screen is \"Move\", and it displays the current path as \"/storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\". Navigation options (home, parent directory \"..\") and confirmation buttons (\"CANCEL\", \"SELECT THIS FOLDER\") are available. This action directly progresses towards the user\\'s goal by opening the necessary interface to choose the destination folder. The active subgoal \"Initiate the move operation for the selected note\" is now completed.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[260,110],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'..\\' entry (folder icon) to navigate to the parent directory. The \\'..\\' entry is located below the current path display \\'/storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\\'. This action is predicted to change the current directory to \\'/storage/emulated/0/Documents/\\', allowing me to search for the \\'MeetingMinutes\\' folder there or to re-enter the \\'markor\\' folder if needed. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [260, 110] was intended to tap the \\'..\\' (parent directory) option in the \"Move\" dialog. However, the tap occurred on an empty area below the actual \\'..\\' entry. Consequently, the screen remained unchanged, still displaying the \\'/storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\\' path. The action was a failure and did not bring the agent closer to selecting the \"MeetingMinutes\" folder. To proceed, the agent must tap the \\'..\\' entry at its correct location.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[200,110],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'..\\' (parent directory) entry, which is represented by a folder icon and two dots. This entry is located below the home icon and above the current path display. The estimated coordinates for the tap are [200, 110]. This action is predicted to navigate to the parent directory \\'/storage/emulated/0/Documents/\\', allowing the \\'MeetingMinutes\\' folder to be located. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [200, 110] on the \\'..\\' (parent directory) entry failed. The screen did not change, and the current path remains \"/storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\". The agent is not closer to selecting the \"MeetingMinutes\" folder. The action needs to be retried with more precise coordinates for the \\'..\\' entry.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[205,105],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the folder icon of the \"..\" (parent directory) entry, located at approximately [205, 105]. This is predicted to navigate to the parent directory \"/storage/emulated/0/Documents/\", which should allow locating the \"MeetingMinutes\" folder. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [205, 105] on the folder icon of the \"..\" (parent directory) entry failed. The screen did not change, and the current path remains \"/storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\". The agent is not closer to selecting the \"MeetingMinutes\" folder. The action needs to be retried by tapping on the text \"..\" instead of the icon.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[205,190],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \"..\" of the parent directory entry, located at approximately [205, 190]. This is predicted to navigate to the parent directory \"/storage/emulated/0/Documents/\", which should allow locating the \"MeetingMinutes\" folder. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'..\\' entry at [205, 190] was successful. The folder selection dialog navigated to the parent directory, \\'/storage/emulated/0/Documents\\'. The list of folders now includes \\'.app\\', \\'MeetingMinutes\\', and \\'StudyGuides\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the \\'MeetingMinutes\\' folder is now accessible for selection.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 19: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[336,518],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"MeetingMinutes\" folder entry, which is visible on the screen. The text \"MeetingMinutes\" is located at approximately [336, 518]. This action is predicted to select \"MeetingMinutes\" as the destination folder for the move operation. The path at the top of the screen should update to include \"MeetingMinutes\". The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[260,110],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'..\\' entry (folder icon) to navigate to the parent directory. The \\'..\\' entry is located below the current path display \\'/storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\\'. This action is predicted to change the current directory to \\'/storage/emulated/0/Documents/\\', allowing me to search for the \\'MeetingMinutes\\' folder there or to re-enter the \\'markor\\' folder if needed. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [260, 110] was intended to tap the \\'..\\' (parent directory) option in the \"Move\" dialog. However, the tap occurred on an empty area below the actual \\'..\\' entry. Consequently, the screen remained unchanged, still displaying the \\'/storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\\' path. The action was a failure and did not bring the agent closer to selecting the \"MeetingMinutes\" folder. To proceed, the agent must tap the \\'..\\' entry at its correct location.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[200,110],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'..\\' (parent directory) entry, which is represented by a folder icon and two dots. This entry is located below the home icon and above the current path display. The estimated coordinates for the tap are [200, 110]. This action is predicted to navigate to the parent directory \\'/storage/emulated/0/Documents/\\', allowing the \\'MeetingMinutes\\' folder to be located. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [200, 110] on the \\'..\\' (parent directory) entry failed. The screen did not change, and the current path remains \"/storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\". The agent is not closer to selecting the \"MeetingMinutes\" folder. The action needs to be retried with more precise coordinates for the \\'..\\' entry.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[205,105],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the folder icon of the \"..\" (parent directory) entry, located at approximately [205, 105]. This is predicted to navigate to the parent directory \"/storage/emulated/0/Documents/\", which should allow locating the \"MeetingMinutes\" folder. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [205, 105] on the folder icon of the \"..\" (parent directory) entry failed. The screen did not change, and the current path remains \"/storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\". The agent is not closer to selecting the \"MeetingMinutes\" folder. The action needs to be retried by tapping on the text \"..\" instead of the icon.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[205,190],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \"..\" of the parent directory entry, located at approximately [205, 190]. This is predicted to navigate to the parent directory \"/storage/emulated/0/Documents/\", which should allow locating the \"MeetingMinutes\" folder. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'..\\' entry at [205, 190] was successful. The folder selection dialog navigated to the parent directory, \\'/storage/emulated/0/Documents\\'. The list of folders now includes \\'.app\\', \\'MeetingMinutes\\', and \\'StudyGuides\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the \\'MeetingMinutes\\' folder is now accessible for selection.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[336,518],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"MeetingMinutes\" folder entry, which is visible on the screen. The text \"MeetingMinutes\" is located at approximately [336, 518]. This action is predicted to select \"MeetingMinutes\" as the destination folder for the move operation. The path at the top of the screen should update to include \"MeetingMinutes\". Actual Outcome: The tap on the \"MeetingMinutes\" folder entry was successful. The folder selection dialog updated: the title changed to \"Move MeetingMinutes\", indicating that \"MeetingMinutes\" is now the selected destination folder. The view also navigated into the \"MeetingMinutes\" folder, displaying its content (which includes an item named \"markor\" at path \"/storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\"). This action successfully selected the destination folder, completing the active subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 43, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.56\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [95, 78, 115, 201], \\'text\\': \\'1i\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [93, 270, 119, 634], \\'text\\': \\'Mheremmgimtners\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [216, 178, 241, 858], \\'text\\': \\'Istorage/lemulated/0 /Documents/markor\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [912, 396, 928, 906], \\'text\\': \\'CANCEL SELECT THIS FOLDER\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [955, 106, 965, 161], \\'text\\': \\'1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [958, 353, 963, 412], \\'text\\': \\'UVU\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [955, 556, 965, 696], \\'text\\': \\'QuICKNOle\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [955, 838, 965, 911], \\'text\\': \\'IIore\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 822, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 141, 37, 189]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 37, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 906, 36, 942]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [148, 856, 180, 931]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [909, 394, 930, 536]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [147, 68, 183, 144]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [985, 363, 1000, 633]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[260,110],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'..\\' entry (folder icon) to navigate to the parent directory. The \\'..\\' entry is located below the current path display \\'/storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\\'. This action is predicted to change the current directory to \\'/storage/emulated/0/Documents/\\', allowing me to search for the \\'MeetingMinutes\\' folder there or to re-enter the \\'markor\\' folder if needed. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [260, 110] was intended to tap the \\'..\\' (parent directory) option in the \"Move\" dialog. However, the tap occurred on an empty area below the actual \\'..\\' entry. Consequently, the screen remained unchanged, still displaying the \\'/storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\\' path. The action was a failure and did not bring the agent closer to selecting the \"MeetingMinutes\" folder. To proceed, the agent must tap the \\'..\\' entry at its correct location.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[200,110],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'..\\' (parent directory) entry, which is represented by a folder icon and two dots. This entry is located below the home icon and above the current path display. The estimated coordinates for the tap are [200, 110]. This action is predicted to navigate to the parent directory \\'/storage/emulated/0/Documents/\\', allowing the \\'MeetingMinutes\\' folder to be located. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [200, 110] on the \\'..\\' (parent directory) entry failed. The screen did not change, and the current path remains \"/storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\". The agent is not closer to selecting the \"MeetingMinutes\" folder. The action needs to be retried with more precise coordinates for the \\'..\\' entry.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[205,105],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the folder icon of the \"..\" (parent directory) entry, located at approximately [205, 105]. This is predicted to navigate to the parent directory \"/storage/emulated/0/Documents/\", which should allow locating the \"MeetingMinutes\" folder. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [205, 105] on the folder icon of the \"..\" (parent directory) entry failed. The screen did not change, and the current path remains \"/storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\". The agent is not closer to selecting the \"MeetingMinutes\" folder. The action needs to be retried by tapping on the text \"..\" instead of the icon.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[205,190],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \"..\" of the parent directory entry, located at approximately [205, 190]. This is predicted to navigate to the parent directory \"/storage/emulated/0/Documents/\", which should allow locating the \"MeetingMinutes\" folder. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'..\\' entry at [205, 190] was successful. The folder selection dialog navigated to the parent directory, \\'/storage/emulated/0/Documents\\'. The list of folders now includes \\'.app\\', \\'MeetingMinutes\\', and \\'StudyGuides\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the \\'MeetingMinutes\\' folder is now accessible for selection.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[336,518],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"MeetingMinutes\" folder entry, which is visible on the screen. The text \"MeetingMinutes\" is located at approximately [336, 518]. This action is predicted to select \"MeetingMinutes\" as the destination folder for the move operation. The path at the top of the screen should update to include \"MeetingMinutes\". Actual Outcome: The tap on the \"MeetingMinutes\" folder entry was successful. The folder selection dialog updated: the title changed to \"Move MeetingMinutes\", indicating that \"MeetingMinutes\" is now the selected destination folder. The view also navigated into the \"MeetingMinutes\" folder, displaying its content (which includes an item named \"markor\" at path \"/storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\"). This action successfully selected the destination folder, completing the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 20: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[920,778],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"SELECT THIS FOLDER\" button to confirm moving the selected note to the \"MeetingMinutes\" folder. The button is located at the bottom right of the dialog. This action is predicted to finalize the move operation and potentially return to the previous screen or show a confirmation message. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",
