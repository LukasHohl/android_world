Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 46, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [123, 46, 147, 306], \\'text\\': \\'Sun; Oct 15\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 336, 722, 431], \\'text\\': \\'Gmail\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 561, 722, 676], \\'text\\': \\'Photos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [704, 781, 722, 921], \\'text\\': \\'YouTube\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [775, 295, 872, 709], \\'text\\': \\'0 (9\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 72, 855, 232]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [788, 764, 856, 929]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 535, 858, 706]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 298, 856, 466]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [628, 536, 729, 695]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 764, 728, 927]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 299, 730, 463]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [901, 701, 947, 795]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [893, 802, 952, 922]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 823, 40, 900]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [895, 87, 950, 184]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is predicted to reveal the list of installed applications, where the Markor app can then be located. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Markor app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[867,615],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon, which is located at approximately [867, 615]. This action is predicted to open the Markor app, displaying its main screen (e.g., file list). Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Markor app icon (located at [867, 615] in the previous screen) successfully launched the Markor application. The current screen shows the Markor app\\'s file browser, displaying several notes including \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\', \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\', and \\'2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md\\'. This action directly led to the completion of the active Subgoal 1 (\"Open Markor App\").\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.35\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [74, 38, 96, 203], \\'text\\': \\'Markor\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 728, 95, 894], \\'text\\': \\'= Q\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [143, 140, 166, 688], \\'text\\': \\'Istorage/emulated/0/Documents\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 142, 223, 789], \\'text\\': \\'2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md 10/15/2023, 15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [236, 141, 283, 576], \\'text\\': \\'proud_cat_edited.txt 10/15/2023, 15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [295, 138, 343, 716], \\'text\\': \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt 10/15/2023, 15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [950, 85, 966, 163], \\'text\\': \\'Files\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [951, 332, 966, 417], \\'text\\': \\'To-Do\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 553, 966, 699], \\'text\\': \\'QuickNote\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 840, 966, 913], \\'text\\': \\'More\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [833, 819, 896, 968]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 494, 974, 758]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 0, 974, 257]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 253, 974, 499]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [175, 4, 235, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 822, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 908, 101, 984]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 711, 99, 795]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 813, 104, 896]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 905, 36, 942]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 837, 972, 914]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 617, 107, 704]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 194, 38, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [984, 363, 1000, 634]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Add a new line between the content of each note.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 2 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (e.g., start at [900, 500], end at [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is predicted to reveal the list of installed applications, where the Markor app can then be located. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Markor app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[867,615],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon, which is located at approximately [867, 615]. This action is predicted to open the Markor app, displaying its main screen (e.g., file list). Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Markor app icon (located at [867, 615] in the previous screen) successfully launched the Markor application. The current screen shows the Markor app\\'s file browser, displaying several notes including \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\', \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\', and \\'2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md\\'.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is predicted to reveal the list of installed applications, where the Markor app can then be located. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Markor app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[867,615],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon, which is located at approximately [867, 615]. This action is predicted to open the Markor app, displaying its main screen (e.g., file list). Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Markor app icon (located at [867, 615] in the previous screen) successfully launched the Markor application. The current screen shows the Markor app\\'s file browser, displaying several notes including \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\', \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\', and \\'2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md\\'. This action directly led to the completion of the active Subgoal 1 (\"Open Markor App\").\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[319,427],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\' to open it. The note is currently listed in the file browser. This action is predicted to open the note in an editor or viewer, allowing its content to be accessed. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\' successfully opened the note. The screen now displays the content of the note, which is \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.36\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 66, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 29, 102, 381], \\'text\\': \\'tough_frog_20.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [134, 37, 156, 470], \\'text\\': \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [938, 150, 962, 332], \\'text\\': \\'= ,\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 834, 972, 930]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [930, 717, 969, 813]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 951, 971, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [930, 482, 970, 577]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [931, 602, 968, 693]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 366, 973, 457]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 908, 100, 985]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [928, 242, 973, 344]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 822, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 617, 98, 703]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [928, 128, 972, 228]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 517, 97, 609]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 811, 102, 897]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 714, 99, 799]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [931, 15, 969, 101]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [985, 362, 1000, 634]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 905, 37, 943]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 38, 239]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 425, 98, 512]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 45, 38, 189]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\n\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nMerge the contents of Markor notes tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt, proud_cat_edited.txt and 2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md (in the same order) into a new Markor note named mIObBbo4 and save it. Add a new line between the content of each note.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 3 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (e.g., start at [900, 500], end at [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is predicted to reveal the list of installed applications, where the Markor app can then be located. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Markor app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[867,615],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon, which is located at approximately [867, 615]. This action is predicted to open the Markor app, displaying its main screen (e.g., file list). Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Markor app icon (located at [867, 615] in the previous screen) successfully launched the Markor application. The current screen shows the Markor app\\'s file browser, displaying several notes including \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\', \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\', and \\'2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md\\'. This action directly led to the completion of the active Subgoal 1 (\"Open Markor App\").\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[319,427],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\' to open it. The note is currently listed in the file browser. This action is predicted to open the note in an editor or viewer, allowing its content to be accessed. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\' successfully opened the note. The screen now displays the content of the note, which is \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 3: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[145,254],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the text content \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' (center at approximately [145, 254]) to initiate text selection. This is predicted to select the text or bring up a context menu with options like \\'Select All\\' and \\'Copy\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen (e.g., file list) is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The app drawer was opened by swiping up.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is predicted to reveal the list of installed applications, where the Markor app can then be located. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Markor app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[867,615],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon, which is located at approximately [867, 615]. This action is predicted to open the Markor app, displaying its main screen (e.g., file list). Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Markor app icon (located at [867, 615] in the previous screen) successfully launched the Markor application. The current screen shows the Markor app\\'s file browser, displaying several notes including \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\', \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\', and \\'2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md\\'. This action directly led to the completion of the active Subgoal 1 (\"Open Markor App\").\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[319,427],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\' to open it. The note is currently listed in the file browser. This action is predicted to open the note in an editor or viewer, allowing its content to be accessed. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\' successfully opened the note. The screen now displays the content of the note, which is \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[145,254],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the text content \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' (center at approximately [145, 254]) to initiate text selection. This is predicted to select the text or bring up a context menu with options like \\'Select All\\' and \\'Copy\\'. Actual Outcome: The long press action on the text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' was successful. It brought up a context menu with options: \"Cut\", \"Copy\", \"Paste\", \"Share\", and \"Select all\". The text content is now selected. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\n\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Add a new line between the content of each note.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 4 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (e.g., start at [900, 500], end at [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is predicted to reveal the list of installed applications, where the Markor app can then be located. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Markor app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[867,615],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon, which is located at approximately [867, 615]. This action is predicted to open the Markor app, displaying its main screen (e.g., file list). Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Markor app icon (located at [867, 615] in the previous screen) successfully launched the Markor application. The current screen shows the Markor app\\'s file browser, displaying several notes including \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\', \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\', and \\'2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md\\'. This action directly led to the completion of the active Subgoal 1 (\"Open Markor App\").\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[319,427],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\' to open it. The note is currently listed in the file browser. This action is predicted to open the note in an editor or viewer, allowing its content to be accessed. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\' successfully opened the note. The screen now displays the content of the note, which is \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[145,254],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the text content \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' (center at approximately [145, 254]) to initiate text selection. This is predicted to select the text or bring up a context menu with options like \\'Select All\\' and \\'Copy\\'. Actual Outcome: The long press action on the text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' was successful. It brought up a context menu with options: \"Cut\", \"Copy\", \"Paste\", \"Share\", and \"Select all\". The text content is now selected. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 4: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[99,223],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Copy\\' button in the context menu. The \\'Copy\\' button is currently visible and enabled. This action is predicted to copy the selected text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' to the clipboard.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is predicted to reveal the list of installed applications, where the Markor app can then be located. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Markor app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[867,615],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon, which is located at approximately [867, 615]. This action is predicted to open the Markor app, displaying its main screen (e.g., file list). Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Markor app icon (located at [867, 615] in the previous screen) successfully launched the Markor application. The current screen shows the Markor app\\'s file browser, displaying several notes including \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\', \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\', and \\'2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md\\'. This action directly led to the completion of the active Subgoal 1 (\"Open Markor App\").\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[319,427],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\' to open it. The note is currently listed in the file browser. This action is predicted to open the note in an editor or viewer, allowing its content to be accessed. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\' successfully opened the note. The screen now displays the content of the note, which is \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[145,254],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the text content \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' (center at approximately [145, 254]) to initiate text selection. This is predicted to select the text or bring up a context menu with options like \\'Select All\\' and \\'Copy\\'. Actual Outcome: The long press action on the text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' was successful. It brought up a context menu with options: \"Cut\", \"Copy\", \"Paste\", \"Share\", and \"Select all\". The text content is now selected. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[99,223],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Copy\\' button in the context menu. The \\'Copy\\' button is currently visible and enabled. This action is predicted to copy the selected text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' to the clipboard. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Copy\\' button was successful. The selected text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' was copied to the clipboard, as confirmed by the pop-up message at the bottom left of the screen. The context menu disappeared. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 42, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.37\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [73, 30, 102, 380], \\'text\\': \\'tough_frog_20.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [133, 37, 157, 475], \\'text\\': \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [836, 65, 893, 214], \\'text\\': \\'m4kMyO GWaENo Pj6FqLjd\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [890, 629, 914, 665], \\'text\\': \\'0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 653], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [864, 402, 912, 521]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [816, 34, 913, 252]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [864, 268, 912, 389]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 834, 926, 932]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 605, 923, 693]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 908, 100, 984]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 950, 925, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 719, 925, 813]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 822, 37, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 617, 99, 703]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 811, 103, 897]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 714, 100, 799]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 516, 98, 609]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 37, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 905, 37, 944]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 141, 37, 188]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 425, 99, 511]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"0\", text=\"m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\n\", resource-id=\"net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"net.gsantner.markor\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[0,275][1080,2102]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\n\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Add a new line between the content of each note.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (e.g., start at [900, 500], end at [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is predicted to reveal the list of installed applications, where the Markor app can then be located. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Markor app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[867,615],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon, which is located at approximately [867, 615]. This action is predicted to open the Markor app, displaying its main screen (e.g., file list). Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Markor app icon (located at [867, 615] in the previous screen) successfully launched the Markor application. The current screen shows the Markor app\\'s file browser, displaying several notes including \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\', \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\', and \\'2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md\\'. This action directly led to the completion of the active Subgoal 1 (\"Open Markor App\").\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[319,427],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\' to open it. The note is currently listed in the file browser. This action is predicted to open the note in an editor or viewer, allowing its content to be accessed. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\' successfully opened the note. The screen now displays the content of the note, which is \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[145,254],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the text content \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' (center at approximately [145, 254]) to initiate text selection. This is predicted to select the text or bring up a context menu with options like \\'Select All\\' and \\'Copy\\'. Actual Outcome: The long press action on the text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' was successful. It brought up a context menu with options: \"Cut\", \"Copy\", \"Paste\", \"Share\", and \"Select all\". The text content is now selected. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[99,223],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Copy\\' button in the context menu. The \\'Copy\\' button is currently visible and enabled. This action is predicted to copy the selected text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' to the clipboard. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Copy\\' button was successful. The selected text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' was copied to the clipboard, as confirmed by the pop-up message at the bottom left of the screen. The context menu disappeared. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 5: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button. This action is predicted to navigate from the current note view back to Markor\\'s main file list screen. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen (e.g., file list) is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The app drawer was opened by swiping up.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[867,615],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon, which is located at approximately [867, 615]. This action is predicted to open the Markor app, displaying its main screen (e.g., file list). Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Markor app icon (located at [867, 615] in the previous screen) successfully launched the Markor application. The current screen shows the Markor app\\'s file browser, displaying several notes including \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\', \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\', and \\'2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md\\'. This action directly led to the completion of the active Subgoal 1 (\"Open Markor App\").\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[319,427],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\' to open it. The note is currently listed in the file browser. This action is predicted to open the note in an editor or viewer, allowing its content to be accessed. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\' successfully opened the note. The screen now displays the content of the note, which is \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[145,254],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the text content \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' (center at approximately [145, 254]) to initiate text selection. This is predicted to select the text or bring up a context menu with options like \\'Select All\\' and \\'Copy\\'. Actual Outcome: The long press action on the text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' was successful. It brought up a context menu with options: \"Cut\", \"Copy\", \"Paste\", \"Share\", and \"Select all\". The text content is now selected. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[99,223],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Copy\\' button in the context menu. The \\'Copy\\' button is currently visible and enabled. This action is predicted to copy the selected text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' to the clipboard. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Copy\\' button was successful. The selected text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' was copied to the clipboard, as confirmed by the pop-up message at the bottom left of the screen. The context menu disappeared. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button. This action is predicted to navigate from the current note view back to Markor\\'s main file list screen. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the virtual keyboard. The screen changed from showing the keyboard to showing the editor\\'s toolbar at the bottom. However, the action did not navigate back to the Markor file list as initially predicted for a single back press. The agent is still viewing the note \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal, as closing the keyboard is a prerequisite for the back button to perform navigation. The next step should be another `KEYCODE_BACK` to return to the file list.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 42, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.37\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [73, 30, 102, 378], \\'text\\': \\'tough_frog_20.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [134, 37, 156, 470], \\'text\\': \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [938, 150, 962, 332], \\'text\\': \\'= ,\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 834, 972, 930]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [930, 717, 969, 814]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 951, 971, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [930, 482, 970, 578]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [931, 602, 968, 693]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 822, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 366, 973, 457]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 908, 99, 985]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [928, 242, 973, 344]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 617, 98, 703]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [928, 128, 972, 228]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 517, 97, 609]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 905, 36, 943]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 811, 102, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 714, 99, 799]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [931, 15, 969, 102]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [985, 362, 1000, 634]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 194, 38, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 63, 38, 189]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 425, 99, 512]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Add a new line between the content of each note.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[867,615],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon, which is located at approximately [867, 615]. This action is predicted to open the Markor app, displaying its main screen (e.g., file list). Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Markor app icon (located at [867, 615] in the previous screen) successfully launched the Markor application. The current screen shows the Markor app\\'s file browser, displaying several notes including \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\', \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\', and \\'2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md\\'. This action directly led to the completion of the active Subgoal 1 (\"Open Markor App\").\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[319,427],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\' to open it. The note is currently listed in the file browser. This action is predicted to open the note in an editor or viewer, allowing its content to be accessed. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\' successfully opened the note. The screen now displays the content of the note, which is \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[145,254],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the text content \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' (center at approximately [145, 254]) to initiate text selection. This is predicted to select the text or bring up a context menu with options like \\'Select All\\' and \\'Copy\\'. Actual Outcome: The long press action on the text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' was successful. It brought up a context menu with options: \"Cut\", \"Copy\", \"Paste\", \"Share\", and \"Select all\". The text content is now selected. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[99,223],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Copy\\' button in the context menu. The \\'Copy\\' button is currently visible and enabled. This action is predicted to copy the selected text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' to the clipboard. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Copy\\' button was successful. The selected text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' was copied to the clipboard, as confirmed by the pop-up message at the bottom left of the screen. The context menu disappeared. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button. This action is predicted to navigate from the current note view back to Markor\\'s main file list screen. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the virtual keyboard. The screen changed from showing the keyboard to showing the editor\\'s toolbar at the bottom. However, the action did not navigate back to the Markor file list as initially predicted for a single back press. The agent is still viewing the note \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal, as closing the keyboard is a prerequisite for the back button to perform navigation. The next step should be another `KEYCODE_BACK` to return to the file list.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 6: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button. This action is predicted to navigate from the current note view back to Markor\\'s main file list screen, completing Subgoal 2. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen (e.g., file list) is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The app drawer was opened by swiping up.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[319,427],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\' to open it. The note is currently listed in the file browser. This action is predicted to open the note in an editor or viewer, allowing its content to be accessed. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\' successfully opened the note. The screen now displays the content of the note, which is \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[145,254],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the text content \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' (center at approximately [145, 254]) to initiate text selection. This is predicted to select the text or bring up a context menu with options like \\'Select All\\' and \\'Copy\\'. Actual Outcome: The long press action on the text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' was successful. It brought up a context menu with options: \"Cut\", \"Copy\", \"Paste\", \"Share\", and \"Select all\". The text content is now selected. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[99,223],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Copy\\' button in the context menu. The \\'Copy\\' button is currently visible and enabled. This action is predicted to copy the selected text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' to the clipboard. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Copy\\' button was successful. The selected text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' was copied to the clipboard, as confirmed by the pop-up message at the bottom left of the screen. The context menu disappeared. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button. This action is predicted to navigate from the current note view back to Markor\\'s main file list screen. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the virtual keyboard. The screen changed from showing the keyboard to showing the editor\\'s toolbar at the bottom. However, the action did not navigate back to the Markor file list as initially predicted for a single back press. The agent is still viewing the note \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal, as closing the keyboard is a prerequisite for the back button to perform navigation. The next step should be another `KEYCODE_BACK` to return to the file list.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button. This action is predicted to navigate from the current note view back to Markor\\'s main file list screen, completing Subgoal 2. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully navigated from the note editor view of \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\' back to the Markor file list screen. This action completed the final step of Subgoal 2.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.38\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [74, 38, 96, 203], \\'text\\': \\'Markor\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 728, 95, 894], \\'text\\': \\'= Q\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [143, 140, 166, 688], \\'text\\': \\'Istorage/emulated/0/Documents\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 142, 223, 789], \\'text\\': \\'2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md 10/15/2023, 15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [236, 141, 283, 576], \\'text\\': \\'proud_cat_edited.txt 10/15/2023, 15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [295, 138, 343, 716], \\'text\\': \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt 10/15/2023, 15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [950, 85, 966, 163], \\'text\\': \\'Files\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [951, 332, 966, 417], \\'text\\': \\'To-Do\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 553, 966, 699], \\'text\\': \\'QuickNote\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 840, 966, 913], \\'text\\': \\'More\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [833, 819, 896, 968]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 494, 974, 758]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 0, 974, 257]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 254, 974, 498]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [175, 4, 235, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 822, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 908, 101, 984]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 905, 36, 942]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 711, 99, 795]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 756, 974, 998]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 813, 103, 896]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 194, 38, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 617, 107, 704]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [985, 363, 1000, 634]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Add a new line between the content of each note.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[319,427],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\' to open it. The note is currently listed in the file browser. This action is predicted to open the note in an editor or viewer, allowing its content to be accessed. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\' successfully opened the note. The screen now displays the content of the note, which is \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[145,254],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the text content \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' (center at approximately [145, 254]) to initiate text selection. This is predicted to select the text or bring up a context menu with options like \\'Select All\\' and \\'Copy\\'. Actual Outcome: The long press action on the text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' was successful. It brought up a context menu with options: \"Cut\", \"Copy\", \"Paste\", \"Share\", and \"Select all\". The text content is now selected. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[99,223],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Copy\\' button in the context menu. The \\'Copy\\' button is currently visible and enabled. This action is predicted to copy the selected text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' to the clipboard. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Copy\\' button was successful. The selected text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' was copied to the clipboard, as confirmed by the pop-up message at the bottom left of the screen. The context menu disappeared. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button. This action is predicted to navigate from the current note view back to Markor\\'s main file list screen. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the virtual keyboard. The screen changed from showing the keyboard to showing the editor\\'s toolbar at the bottom. However, the action did not navigate back to the Markor file list as initially predicted for a single back press. The agent is still viewing the note \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal, as closing the keyboard is a prerequisite for the back button to perform navigation. The next step should be another `KEYCODE_BACK` to return to the file list.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button. This action is predicted to navigate from the current note view back to Markor\\'s main file list screen, completing Subgoal 2. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully navigated from the note editor view of \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\' back to the Markor file list screen. This action completed the final step of Subgoal 2.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 7: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[259,358],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\' to open it. The note is currently listed in the file browser. This action is predicted to open the note in an editor or viewer, allowing its content to be accessed.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[145,254],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the text content \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' (center at approximately [145, 254]) to initiate text selection. This is predicted to select the text or bring up a context menu with options like \\'Select All\\' and \\'Copy\\'. Actual Outcome: The long press action on the text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' was successful. It brought up a context menu with options: \"Cut\", \"Copy\", \"Paste\", \"Share\", and \"Select all\". The text content is now selected. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[99,223],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Copy\\' button in the context menu. The \\'Copy\\' button is currently visible and enabled. This action is predicted to copy the selected text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' to the clipboard. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Copy\\' button was successful. The selected text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' was copied to the clipboard, as confirmed by the pop-up message at the bottom left of the screen. The context menu disappeared. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button. This action is predicted to navigate from the current note view back to Markor\\'s main file list screen. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the virtual keyboard. The screen changed from showing the keyboard to showing the editor\\'s toolbar at the bottom. However, the action did not navigate back to the Markor file list as initially predicted for a single back press. The agent is still viewing the note \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal, as closing the keyboard is a prerequisite for the back button to perform navigation. The next step should be another `KEYCODE_BACK` to return to the file list.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button. This action is predicted to navigate from the current note view back to Markor\\'s main file list screen, completing Subgoal 2. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully navigated from the note editor view of \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\' back to the Markor file list screen. This action completed the final step of Subgoal 2.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[259,358],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\' to open it. The note is currently listed in the file browser. This action is predicted to open the note in an editor or viewer, allowing its content to be accessed. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\' successfully opened the note. The screen now displays the content of the note, which is \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.38\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 66, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [70, 32, 101, 405], \\'text\\': \\'proud_cat_edit_\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [134, 33, 156, 435], \\'text\\': \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [938, 150, 962, 332], \\'text\\': \\'= ,\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 834, 972, 931]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [930, 717, 969, 813]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 951, 971, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [931, 603, 968, 693]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [930, 483, 970, 577]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 366, 973, 457]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 909, 99, 985]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [928, 243, 973, 344]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 822, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [928, 129, 972, 227]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 617, 99, 703]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 517, 97, 609]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 811, 102, 897]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [931, 15, 969, 101]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [985, 362, 1000, 634]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 905, 37, 943]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 712, 99, 798]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 38, 239]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 46, 37, 189]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\n\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nMerge the contents of Markor notes tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt, proud_cat_edited.txt and 2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md (in the same order) into a new Markor note named mIObBbo4 and save it. Add a new line between the content of each note.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[145,254],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the text content \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' (center at approximately [145, 254]) to initiate text selection. This is predicted to select the text or bring up a context menu with options like \\'Select All\\' and \\'Copy\\'. Actual Outcome: The long press action on the text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' was successful. It brought up a context menu with options: \"Cut\", \"Copy\", \"Paste\", \"Share\", and \"Select all\". The text content is now selected. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[99,223],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Copy\\' button in the context menu. The \\'Copy\\' button is currently visible and enabled. This action is predicted to copy the selected text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' to the clipboard. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Copy\\' button was successful. The selected text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' was copied to the clipboard, as confirmed by the pop-up message at the bottom left of the screen. The context menu disappeared. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button. This action is predicted to navigate from the current note view back to Markor\\'s main file list screen. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the virtual keyboard. The screen changed from showing the keyboard to showing the editor\\'s toolbar at the bottom. However, the action did not navigate back to the Markor file list as initially predicted for a single back press. The agent is still viewing the note \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal, as closing the keyboard is a prerequisite for the back button to perform navigation. The next step should be another `KEYCODE_BACK` to return to the file list.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button. This action is predicted to navigate from the current note view back to Markor\\'s main file list screen, completing Subgoal 2. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully navigated from the note editor view of \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\' back to the Markor file list screen. This action completed the final step of Subgoal 2.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[259,358],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\' to open it. The note is currently listed in the file browser. This action is predicted to open the note in an editor or viewer, allowing its content to be accessed. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\' successfully opened the note. The screen now displays the content of the note, which is \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 8: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[145,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the text content \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\' (center at approximately [145, 234]) to initiate text selection. This is predicted to select the text or bring up a context menu with options like \\'Select All\\' and \\'Copy\\'.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[99,223],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Copy\\' button in the context menu. The \\'Copy\\' button is currently visible and enabled. This action is predicted to copy the selected text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' to the clipboard. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Copy\\' button was successful. The selected text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' was copied to the clipboard, as confirmed by the pop-up message at the bottom left of the screen. The context menu disappeared. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button. This action is predicted to navigate from the current note view back to Markor\\'s main file list screen. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the virtual keyboard. The screen changed from showing the keyboard to showing the editor\\'s toolbar at the bottom. However, the action did not navigate back to the Markor file list as initially predicted for a single back press. The agent is still viewing the note \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal, as closing the keyboard is a prerequisite for the back button to perform navigation. The next step should be another `KEYCODE_BACK` to return to the file list.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button. This action is predicted to navigate from the current note view back to Markor\\'s main file list screen, completing Subgoal 2. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully navigated from the note editor view of \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\' back to the Markor file list screen. This action completed the final step of Subgoal 2.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[259,358],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\' to open it. The note is currently listed in the file browser. This action is predicted to open the note in an editor or viewer, allowing its content to be accessed. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\' successfully opened the note. The screen now displays the content of the note, which is \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[145,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the text content \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\' (center at approximately [145, 234]) to initiate text selection. This is predicted to select the text or bring up a context menu with options like \\'Select All\\' and \\'Copy\\'. Actual Outcome: The long press action on the text \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\' was successful. The text was selected, and a context menu appeared at the top of the screen with options: \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Paste\\', \\'Share\\', and \\'Select all\\'. This action directly contributes to the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content by preparing the text for copying.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\n\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Add a new line between the content of each note.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[99,223],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Copy\\' button in the context menu. The \\'Copy\\' button is currently visible and enabled. This action is predicted to copy the selected text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' to the clipboard. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Copy\\' button was successful. The selected text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' was copied to the clipboard, as confirmed by the pop-up message at the bottom left of the screen. The context menu disappeared. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button. This action is predicted to navigate from the current note view back to Markor\\'s main file list screen. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the virtual keyboard. The screen changed from showing the keyboard to showing the editor\\'s toolbar at the bottom. However, the action did not navigate back to the Markor file list as initially predicted for a single back press. The agent is still viewing the note \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal, as closing the keyboard is a prerequisite for the back button to perform navigation. The next step should be another `KEYCODE_BACK` to return to the file list.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button. This action is predicted to navigate from the current note view back to Markor\\'s main file list screen, completing Subgoal 2. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully navigated from the note editor view of \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\' back to the Markor file list screen. This action completed the final step of Subgoal 2.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[259,358],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\' to open it. The note is currently listed in the file browser. This action is predicted to open the note in an editor or viewer, allowing its content to be accessed. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\' successfully opened the note. The screen now displays the content of the note, which is \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[145,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the text content \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\' (center at approximately [145, 234]) to initiate text selection. This is predicted to select the text or bring up a context menu with options like \\'Select All\\' and \\'Copy\\'. Actual Outcome: The long press action on the text \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\' was successful. The text was selected, and a context menu appeared at the top of the screen with options: \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Paste\\', \\'Share\\', and \\'Select all\\'. This action directly contributes to the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content by preparing the text for copying.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 9: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[99,223],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Copy\\' button in the context menu. The \\'Copy\\' button is currently visible and enabled. This action is predicted to copy the selected text \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\' to the clipboard.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is predicted to navigate from the current note view back to Markor\\'s main file list screen. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the virtual keyboard. The screen changed from showing the keyboard to showing the editor\\'s toolbar at the bottom. However, the action did not navigate back to the Markor file list as initially predicted for a single back press. The agent is still viewing the note \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal, as closing the keyboard is a prerequisite for the back button to perform navigation. The next step should be another `KEYCODE_BACK` to return to the file list.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button. This action is predicted to navigate from the current note view back to Markor\\'s main file list screen, completing Subgoal 2. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully navigated from the note editor view of \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\' back to the Markor file list screen. This action completed the final step of Subgoal 2.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[259,358],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\' to open it. The note is currently listed in the file browser. This action is predicted to open the note in an editor or viewer, allowing its content to be accessed. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\' successfully opened the note. The screen now displays the content of the note, which is \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[145,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the text content \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\' (center at approximately [145, 234]) to initiate text selection. This is predicted to select the text or bring up a context menu with options like \\'Select All\\' and \\'Copy\\'. Actual Outcome: The long press action on the text \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\' was successful. The text was selected, and a context menu appeared at the top of the screen with options: \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Paste\\', \\'Share\\', and \\'Select all\\'. This action directly contributes to the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content by preparing the text for copying.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

The \\'Copy\\' button is currently visible and enabled. This action is predicted to copy the selected text \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\' to the clipboard. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Copy\\' button was successful. The selected text \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\' was copied to the clipboard, as confirmed by the pop-up message at the bottom left of the screen showing the copied text. The context menu disappeared. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.39\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 66, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [70, 32, 101, 405], \\'text\\': \\'proud_cat_edit_\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [134, 34, 156, 438], \\'text\\': \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg]\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [831, 61, 897, 225], \\'text\\': \\'fxHXZsq rmnwYj Xvtegpg\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [890, 629, 914, 665], \\'text\\': \\'0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 653], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [864, 402, 912, 520]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [864, 268, 912, 389]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [816, 37, 913, 251]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 834, 926, 931]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 605, 923, 693]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 908, 100, 984]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 950, 924, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 720, 924, 812]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 822, 37, 897]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 811, 103, 897]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 617, 100, 703]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 712, 100, 798]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 905, 37, 944]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 516, 98, 609]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 37, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 141, 37, 188]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"0\", text=\"fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\n\", resource-id=\"net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"net.gsantner.markor\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[0,275][1080,2102]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\n\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Add a new line between the content of each note.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button. This action is predicted to navigate from the current note view back to Markor\\'s main file list screen. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the virtual keyboard. The screen changed from showing the keyboard to showing the editor\\'s toolbar at the bottom. However, the action did not navigate back to the Markor file list as initially predicted for a single back press. The agent is still viewing the note \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal, as closing the keyboard is a prerequisite for the back button to perform navigation. The next step should be another `KEYCODE_BACK` to return to the file list.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button. This action is predicted to navigate from the current note view back to Markor\\'s main file list screen, completing Subgoal 2. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully navigated from the note editor view of \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\' back to the Markor file list screen. This action completed the final step of Subgoal 2.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[259,358],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\' to open it. The note is currently listed in the file browser. This action is predicted to open the note in an editor or viewer, allowing its content to be accessed. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\' successfully opened the note. The screen now displays the content of the note, which is \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[145,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the text content \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\' (center at approximately [145, 234]) to initiate text selection. This is predicted to select the text or bring up a context menu with options like \\'Select All\\' and \\'Copy\\'. Actual Outcome: The long press action on the text \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\' was successful. The text was selected, and a context menu appeared at the top of the screen with options: \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Paste\\', \\'Share\\', and \\'Select all\\'. This action directly contributes to the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content by preparing the text for copying.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[99,223],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Copy\\' button in the context menu. The \\'Copy\\' button is currently visible and enabled. This action is predicted to copy the selected text \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\' to the clipboard. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Copy\\' button was successful. The selected text \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\' was copied to the clipboard, as confirmed by the pop-up message at the bottom left of the screen showing the copied text. The context menu disappeared. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 10: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button. Since the virtual keyboard is currently open, this action is predicted to close the virtual keyboard. The screen will then show the note editor without the keyboard.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution.

Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully navigated from the note editor view of \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\' back to the Markor file list screen. This action completed the final step of Subgoal 2.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[259,358],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\' to open it. The note is currently listed in the file browser. This action is predicted to open the note in an editor or viewer, allowing its content to be accessed. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\' successfully opened the note. The screen now displays the content of the note, which is \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[145,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the text content \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\' (center at approximately [145, 234]) to initiate text selection. This is predicted to select the text or bring up a context menu with options like \\'Select All\\' and \\'Copy\\'. Actual Outcome: The long press action on the text \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\' was successful. The text was selected, and a context menu appeared at the top of the screen with options: \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Paste\\', \\'Share\\', and \\'Select all\\'. This action directly contributes to the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content by preparing the text for copying.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[99,223],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Copy\\' button in the context menu. The \\'Copy\\' button is currently visible and enabled. This action is predicted to copy the selected text \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\' to the clipboard. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Copy\\' button was successful. The selected text \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\' was copied to the clipboard, as confirmed by the pop-up message at the bottom left of the screen showing the copied text. The context menu disappeared. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button. Since the virtual keyboard is currently open, this action is predicted to close the virtual keyboard. The screen will then show the note editor without the keyboard. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the virtual keyboard and the text selection context menu. The screen changed from showing the keyboard and context menu to showing the note editor\\'s toolbar at the bottom. The agent is still viewing the note \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as closing the keyboard is a necessary step before the back button can navigate out of the editor. The next step should be another `KEYCODE_BACK` to return to the file list.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 42, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.40\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 66, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 32, 101, 405], \\'text\\': \\'proud_cat_edit_\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [134, 34, 156, 438], \\'text\\': \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg]\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [938, 150, 962, 332], \\'text\\': \\'= ,\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 834, 972, 930]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [931, 718, 969, 813]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 952, 971, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [930, 483, 970, 577]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [931, 603, 967, 692]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 366, 973, 456]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 909, 99, 984]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [928, 243, 973, 343]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 822, 37, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 129, 972, 227]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 617, 99, 703]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [931, 15, 969, 101]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 811, 102, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [985, 362, 1000, 634]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 517, 97, 609]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 905, 37, 943]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 713, 99, 798]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 195, 38, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 114, 37, 189]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is predicted to navigate from the current note view back to Markor\\'s main file list screen, completing Subgoal 2. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully navigated from the note editor view of \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\' back to the Markor file list screen. This action completed the final step of Subgoal 2.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[259,358],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\' to open it. The note is currently listed in the file browser. This action is predicted to open the note in an editor or viewer, allowing its content to be accessed. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\' successfully opened the note. The screen now displays the content of the note, which is \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[145,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the text content \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\' (center at approximately [145, 234]) to initiate text selection. This is predicted to select the text or bring up a context menu with options like \\'Select All\\' and \\'Copy\\'. Actual Outcome: The long press action on the text \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\' was successful. The text was selected, and a context menu appeared at the top of the screen with options: \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Paste\\', \\'Share\\', and \\'Select all\\'. This action directly contributes to the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content by preparing the text for copying.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[99,223],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Copy\\' button in the context menu. The \\'Copy\\' button is currently visible and enabled. This action is predicted to copy the selected text \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\' to the clipboard. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Copy\\' button was successful. The selected text \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\' was copied to the clipboard, as confirmed by the pop-up message at the bottom left of the screen showing the copied text. The context menu disappeared. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button. Since the virtual keyboard is currently open, this action is predicted to close the virtual keyboard. The screen will then show the note editor without the keyboard. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the virtual keyboard and the text selection context menu. The screen changed from showing the keyboard and context menu to showing the note editor\\'s toolbar at the bottom. The agent is still viewing the note \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as closing the keyboard is a necessary step before the back button can navigate out of the editor. The next step should be another `KEYCODE_BACK` to return to the file list.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 11: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button. This action is predicted to navigate from the current note editor view of \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\' back to Markor\\'s main file list screen, completing Subgoal 3.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[259,358],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\' to open it. The note is currently listed in the file browser. This action is predicted to open the note in an editor or viewer, allowing its content to be accessed. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\' successfully opened the note. The screen now displays the content of the note, which is \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[145,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the text content \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\' (center at approximately [145, 234]) to initiate text selection. This is predicted to select the text or bring up a context menu with options like \\'Select All\\' and \\'Copy\\'. Actual Outcome: The long press action on the text \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\' was successful. The text was selected, and a context menu appeared at the top of the screen with options: \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Paste\\', \\'Share\\', and \\'Select all\\'. This action directly contributes to the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content by preparing the text for copying.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[99,223],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Copy\\' button in the context menu. The \\'Copy\\' button is currently visible and enabled. This action is predicted to copy the selected text \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\' to the clipboard. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Copy\\' button was successful. The selected text \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\' was copied to the clipboard, as confirmed by the pop-up message at the bottom left of the screen showing the copied text. The context menu disappeared. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button. Since the virtual keyboard is currently open, this action is predicted to close the virtual keyboard. The screen will then show the note editor without the keyboard. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the virtual keyboard and the text selection context menu. The screen changed from showing the keyboard and context menu to showing the note editor\\'s toolbar at the bottom. The agent is still viewing the note \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as closing the keyboard is a necessary step before the back button can navigate out of the editor. The next step should be another `KEYCODE_BACK` to return to the file list.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button. This action is predicted to navigate from the current note editor view of \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\' back to Markor\\'s main file list screen, completing Subgoal 3. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully navigated from the note editor view of \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\' back to the Markor file list screen. The screen now displays the list of files, including \\'2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md\\', \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\', and \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\'. This action completed Subgoal 3.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Add a new line between the content of each note.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[259,358],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\' to open it. The note is currently listed in the file browser. This action is predicted to open the note in an editor or viewer, allowing its content to be accessed. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\' successfully opened the note. The screen now displays the content of the note, which is \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[145,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the text content \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\' (center at approximately [145, 234]) to initiate text selection. This is predicted to select the text or bring up a context menu with options like \\'Select All\\' and \\'Copy\\'. Actual Outcome: The long press action on the text \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\' was successful. The text was selected, and a context menu appeared at the top of the screen with options: \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Paste\\', \\'Share\\', and \\'Select all\\'. This action directly contributes to the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content by preparing the text for copying.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[99,223],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Copy\\' button in the context menu. The \\'Copy\\' button is currently visible and enabled. This action is predicted to copy the selected text \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\' to the clipboard. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Copy\\' button was successful. The selected text \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\' was copied to the clipboard, as confirmed by the pop-up message at the bottom left of the screen showing the copied text. The context menu disappeared. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button. Since the virtual keyboard is currently open, this action is predicted to close the virtual keyboard. The screen will then show the note editor without the keyboard. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the virtual keyboard and the text selection context menu. The screen changed from showing the keyboard and context menu to showing the note editor\\'s toolbar at the bottom. The agent is still viewing the note \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as closing the keyboard is a necessary step before the back button can navigate out of the editor. The next step should be another `KEYCODE_BACK` to return to the file list.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button. This action is predicted to navigate from the current note editor view of \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\' back to Markor\\'s main file list screen, completing Subgoal 3. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully navigated from the note editor view of \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\' back to the Markor file list screen. The screen now displays the list of files, including \\'2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md\\', \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\', and \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\'. This action completed Subgoal 3.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 12: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[200,465],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md\\' to open it. The note is currently listed in the file browser. This action is predicted to open the note in an editor or viewer, allowing its content to be accessed.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar.

For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[145,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the text content \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\' (center at approximately [145, 234]) to initiate text selection. This is predicted to select the text or bring up a context menu with options like \\'Select All\\' and \\'Copy\\'. Actual Outcome: The long press action on the text \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\' was successful. The text was selected, and a context menu appeared at the top of the screen with options: \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Paste\\', \\'Share\\', and \\'Select all\\'. This action directly contributes to the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content by preparing the text for copying.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[99,223],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Copy\\' button in the context menu. The \\'Copy\\' button is currently visible and enabled. This action is predicted to copy the selected text \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\' to the clipboard. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Copy\\' button was successful. The selected text \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\' was copied to the clipboard, as confirmed by the pop-up message at the bottom left of the screen showing the copied text. The context menu disappeared. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button. Since the virtual keyboard is currently open, this action is predicted to close the virtual keyboard. The screen will then show the note editor without the keyboard. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the virtual keyboard and the text selection context menu. The screen changed from showing the keyboard and context menu to showing the note editor\\'s toolbar at the bottom. The agent is still viewing the note \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as closing the keyboard is a necessary step before the back button can navigate out of the editor. The next step should be another `KEYCODE_BACK` to return to the file list.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button. This action is predicted to navigate from the current note editor view of \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\' back to Markor\\'s main file list screen, completing Subgoal 3. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully navigated from the note editor view of \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\' back to the Markor file list screen. The screen now displays the list of files, including \\'2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md\\', \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\', and \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\'. This action completed Subgoal 3.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[200,465],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md\\' to open it. The note is currently listed in the file browser. This action is predicted to open the note in an editor or viewer, allowing its content to be accessed. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md\\' successfully opened the note. The screen now displays the content of the note, which is \\'f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 41, 36, 133], \\'text\\': \\'15.41\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 66, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [73, 34, 99, 417], \\'text\\': \\'2023_08_21_fri _\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [135, 34, 155, 468], \\'text\\': \\'f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [936, 150, 964, 495], \\'text\\': \\'= B  I\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 950, 973, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 596, 971, 698]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 365, 970, 457]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 248, 971, 342]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [928, 124, 972, 231]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 717, 971, 814]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 908, 100, 985]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [930, 834, 971, 931]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 821, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 140, 37, 189]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 483, 971, 573]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 811, 102, 897]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 617, 99, 703]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 38, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 517, 98, 609]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 713, 100, 799]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 905, 36, 943]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 9, 973, 105]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [985, 361, 1000, 634]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right.

Add a new line between the content of each note.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[145,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the text content \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\' (center at approximately [145, 234]) to initiate text selection. This is predicted to select the text or bring up a context menu with options like \\'Select All\\' and \\'Copy\\'. Actual Outcome: The long press action on the text \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\' was successful. The text was selected, and a context menu appeared at the top of the screen with options: \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Paste\\', \\'Share\\', and \\'Select all\\'. This action directly contributes to the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content by preparing the text for copying.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[99,223],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Copy\\' button in the context menu. The \\'Copy\\' button is currently visible and enabled. This action is predicted to copy the selected text \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\' to the clipboard. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Copy\\' button was successful. The selected text \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\' was copied to the clipboard, as confirmed by the pop-up message at the bottom left of the screen showing the copied text. The context menu disappeared. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button. Since the virtual keyboard is currently open, this action is predicted to close the virtual keyboard. The screen will then show the note editor without the keyboard. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the virtual keyboard and the text selection context menu. The screen changed from showing the keyboard and context menu to showing the note editor\\'s toolbar at the bottom. The agent is still viewing the note \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as closing the keyboard is a necessary step before the back button can navigate out of the editor. The next step should be another `KEYCODE_BACK` to return to the file list.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button. This action is predicted to navigate from the current note editor view of \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\' back to Markor\\'s main file list screen, completing Subgoal 3. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully navigated from the note editor view of \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\' back to the Markor file list screen. The screen now displays the list of files, including \\'2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md\\', \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\', and \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\'. This action completed Subgoal 3.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[200,465],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md\\' to open it. The note is currently listed in the file browser. This action is predicted to open the note in an editor or viewer, allowing its content to be accessed. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md\\' successfully opened the note. The screen now displays the content of the note, which is \\'f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 13: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[145,251],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the text content \\'f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' (center at approximately [145, 251]) to initiate text selection. This is predicted to select the text or bring up a context menu with options like \\'Select All\\' and \\'Copy\\'.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[99,223],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Copy\\' button in the context menu. The \\'Copy\\' button is currently visible and enabled. This action is predicted to copy the selected text \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\' to the clipboard. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Copy\\' button was successful. The selected text \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\' was copied to the clipboard, as confirmed by the pop-up message at the bottom left of the screen showing the copied text. The context menu disappeared. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button. Since the virtual keyboard is currently open, this action is predicted to close the virtual keyboard. The screen will then show the note editor without the keyboard. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the virtual keyboard and the text selection context menu. The screen changed from showing the keyboard and context menu to showing the note editor\\'s toolbar at the bottom. The agent is still viewing the note \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as closing the keyboard is a necessary step before the back button can navigate out of the editor. The next step should be another `KEYCODE_BACK` to return to the file list.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button. This action is predicted to navigate from the current note editor view of \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\' back to Markor\\'s main file list screen, completing Subgoal 3. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully navigated from the note editor view of \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\' back to the Markor file list screen. The screen now displays the list of files, including \\'2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md\\', \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\', and \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\'. This action completed Subgoal 3.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[200,465],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md\\' to open it. The note is currently listed in the file browser. This action is predicted to open the note in an editor or viewer, allowing its content to be accessed. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md\\' successfully opened the note. The screen now displays the content of the note, which is \\'f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[145,251],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the text content \\'f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' (center at approximately [145, 251]) to initiate text selection. This is predicted to select the text or bring up a context menu with options like \\'Select All\\' and \\'Copy\\'. Actual Outcome: The long press action on the text \\'f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' was successful. The text was selected, and a context menu appeared at the top of the screen with options: \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Paste\\', \\'Share\\', and \\'Select all\\'. This action directly contributes to the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content by preparing the text for copying.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"f42GOjFWb2aKHogAFQSY\\n\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Add a new line between the content of each note.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[99,223],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Copy\\' button in the context menu. The \\'Copy\\' button is currently visible and enabled. This action is predicted to copy the selected text \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\' to the clipboard. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Copy\\' button was successful. The selected text \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\' was copied to the clipboard, as confirmed by the pop-up message at the bottom left of the screen showing the copied text. The context menu disappeared. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button. Since the virtual keyboard is currently open, this action is predicted to close the virtual keyboard. The screen will then show the note editor without the keyboard. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the virtual keyboard and the text selection context menu. The screen changed from showing the keyboard and context menu to showing the note editor\\'s toolbar at the bottom. The agent is still viewing the note \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as closing the keyboard is a necessary step before the back button can navigate out of the editor. The next step should be another `KEYCODE_BACK` to return to the file list.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button. This action is predicted to navigate from the current note editor view of \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\' back to Markor\\'s main file list screen, completing Subgoal 3. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully navigated from the note editor view of \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\' back to the Markor file list screen. The screen now displays the list of files, including \\'2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md\\', \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\', and \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\'. This action completed Subgoal 3.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[200,465],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md\\' to open it. The note is currently listed in the file browser. This action is predicted to open the note in an editor or viewer, allowing its content to be accessed. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md\\' successfully opened the note. The screen now displays the content of the note, which is \\'f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[145,251],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the text content \\'f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' (center at approximately [145, 251]) to initiate text selection. This is predicted to select the text or bring up a context menu with options like \\'Select All\\' and \\'Copy\\'. Actual Outcome: The long press action on the text \\'f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' was successful. The text was selected, and a context menu appeared at the top of the screen with options: \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Paste\\', \\'Share\\', and \\'Select all\\'. This action directly contributes to the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content by preparing the text for copying.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 14: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[99,223],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Copy\\' button in the context menu. The \\'Copy\\' button is currently visible and enabled. This action is predicted to copy the selected text \\'f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' to the clipboard.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully navigated from the note editor view of \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\' back to the Markor file list screen. The screen now displays the list of files, including \\'2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md\\', \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\', and \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\'.

Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Copy\\' button was successful. The selected text \\'f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' was copied to the clipboard. This is confirmed by the toast message \\'f42GOjF Wb2aKH ogAFQSY\\' that appeared at the bottom left of the screen. The context menu at the top of the screen disappeared.

Since the virtual keyboard is currently open, this action is predicted to close the virtual keyboard. The screen will then show the note editor without the keyboard, and the text selection might also be cleared. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the virtual keyboard. The screen changed from showing the note editor with the keyboard open to showing the note editor with its formatting toolbar at the bottom. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as closing the keyboard is a necessary step before the back button can navigate out of the editor.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The note is currently listed in the file browser. This action is predicted to open the note in an editor or viewer, allowing its content to be accessed. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md\\' successfully opened the note. The screen now displays the content of the note, which is \\'f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[145,251],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the text content \\'f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' (center at approximately [145, 251]) to initiate text selection. This is predicted to select the text or bring up a context menu with options like \\'Select All\\' and \\'Copy\\'. Actual Outcome: The long press action on the text \\'f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' was successful. The text was selected, and a context menu appeared at the top of the screen with options: \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Paste\\', \\'Share\\', and \\'Select all\\'. This action directly contributes to the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content by preparing the text for copying.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[99,223],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Copy\\' button in the context menu. The \\'Copy\\' button is currently visible and enabled. This action is predicted to copy the selected text \\'f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' to the clipboard. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Copy\\' button was successful. The selected text \\'f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' was copied to the clipboard. This is confirmed by the toast message \\'f42GOjF Wb2aKH ogAFQSY\\' that appeared at the bottom left of the screen. The context menu at the top of the screen disappeared. The virtual keyboard remains visible. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button. Since the virtual keyboard is currently open, this action is predicted to close the virtual keyboard. The screen will then show the note editor without the keyboard, and the text selection might also be cleared. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the virtual keyboard. The screen changed from showing the note editor with the keyboard open to showing the note editor with its formatting toolbar at the bottom. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as closing the keyboard is a necessary step before the back button can navigate out of the editor. The next step is to press back again to return to the file list.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button. This action is predicted to navigate from the current note editor view of \\'2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md\\' back to Markor\\'s main file list screen, completing Subgoal 4. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully navigated from the note editor view of \\'2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md\\' back to the Markor file list screen. The screen now displays the list of files. This action completed Subgoal 4.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1.

Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field.

If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Add a new line between the content of each note.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[200,465],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md\\' to open it. The note is currently listed in the file browser. This action is predicted to open the note in an editor or viewer, allowing its content to be accessed. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md\\' successfully opened the note. The screen now displays the content of the note, which is \\'f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[145,251],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the text content \\'f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' (center at approximately [145, 251]) to initiate text selection. This is predicted to select the text or bring up a context menu with options like \\'Select All\\' and \\'Copy\\'. Actual Outcome: The long press action on the text \\'f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' was successful. The text was selected, and a context menu appeared at the top of the screen with options: \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Paste\\', \\'Share\\', and \\'Select all\\'. This action directly contributes to the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content by preparing the text for copying.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[99,223],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Copy\\' button in the context menu. The \\'Copy\\' button is currently visible and enabled. This action is predicted to copy the selected text \\'f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' to the clipboard. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Copy\\' button was successful. The selected text \\'f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' was copied to the clipboard. This is confirmed by the toast message \\'f42GOjF Wb2aKH ogAFQSY\\' that appeared at the bottom left of the screen. The context menu at the top of the screen disappeared. The virtual keyboard remains visible. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button. Since the virtual keyboard is currently open, this action is predicted to close the virtual keyboard. The screen will then show the note editor without the keyboard, and the text selection might also be cleared. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the virtual keyboard. The screen changed from showing the note editor with the keyboard open to showing the note editor with its formatting toolbar at the bottom. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as closing the keyboard is a necessary step before the back button can navigate out of the editor.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[145,251],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the text content \\'f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' (center at approximately [145, 251]) to initiate text selection. This is predicted to select the text or bring up a context menu with options like \\'Select All\\' and \\'Copy\\'. Actual Outcome: The long press action on the text \\'f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' was successful. The text was selected, and a context menu appeared at the top of the screen with options: \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Paste\\', \\'Share\\', and \\'Select all\\'. This action directly contributes to the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content by preparing the text for copying.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[99,223],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Copy\\' button in the context menu. The \\'Copy\\' button is currently visible and enabled. This action is predicted to copy the selected text \\'f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' to the clipboard. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Copy\\' button was successful. The selected text \\'f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' was copied to the clipboard. This is confirmed by the toast message \\'f42GOjF Wb2aKH ogAFQSY\\' that appeared at the bottom left of the screen. The context menu at the top of the screen disappeared. The virtual keyboard remains visible. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button. Since the virtual keyboard is currently open, this action is predicted to close the virtual keyboard. The screen will then show the note editor without the keyboard, and the text selection might also be cleared. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the virtual keyboard. The screen changed from showing the note editor with the keyboard open to showing the note editor with its formatting toolbar at the bottom. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as closing the keyboard is a necessary step before the back button can navigate out of the editor. The next step is to press back again to return to the file list.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button. This action is predicted to navigate from the current note editor view of \\'2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md\\' back to Markor\\'s main file list screen, completing Subgoal 4. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully navigated from the note editor view of \\'2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md\\' back to the Markor file list screen. The screen now displays the list of files. This action completed Subgoal 4.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

This button is currently visible and enabled. This action is predicted to open a dialog or a new screen for creating a new note. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'+\\' button successfully opened a dialog box for creating a new note. The dialog prompts for the note\\'s name, type, and template.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nMerge the contents of Markor notes tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt, proud_cat_edited.txt and 2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md (in the same order) into a new Markor note named mIObBbo4 and save it. Add a new line between the content of each note.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[145,251],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the text content \\'f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' (center at approximately [145, 251]) to initiate text selection. This is predicted to select the text or bring up a context menu with options like \\'Select All\\' and \\'Copy\\'. Actual Outcome: The long press action on the text \\'f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' was successful. The text was selected, and a context menu appeared at the top of the screen with options: \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Paste\\', \\'Share\\', and \\'Select all\\'. This action directly contributes to the active subgoal of retrieving the note\\'s content by preparing the text for copying.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[99,223],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Copy\\' button in the context menu. The \\'Copy\\' button is currently visible and enabled. This action is predicted to copy the selected text \\'f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' to the clipboard. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Copy\\' button was successful. The selected text \\'f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' was copied to the clipboard. This is confirmed by the toast message \\'f42GOjF Wb2aKH ogAFQSY\\' that appeared at the bottom left of the screen. The context menu at the top of the screen disappeared. The virtual keyboard remains visible. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button. Since the virtual keyboard is currently open, this action is predicted to close the virtual keyboard. The screen will then show the note editor without the keyboard, and the text selection might also be cleared. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the virtual keyboard. The screen changed from showing the note editor with the keyboard open to showing the note editor with its formatting toolbar at the bottom. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as closing the keyboard is a necessary step before the back button can navigate out of the editor. The next step is to press back again to return to the file list.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button. This action is predicted to navigate from the current note editor view of \\'2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md\\' back to Markor\\'s main file list screen, completing Subgoal 4. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully navigated from the note editor view of \\'2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md\\' back to the Markor file list screen. The screen now displays the list of files. This action completed Subgoal 4.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[864,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the red \\'+\\' button located in the bottom right corner of the screen. This button is currently visible and enabled. This action is predicted to open a dialog or a new screen for creating a new note. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'+\\' button successfully opened a dialog box for creating a new note. The dialog prompts for the note\\'s name, type, and template. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by initiating the note creation process.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 18: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[396,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text field currently showing \\'my_note\\' (center at approximately [396, 153]) to select it. This is predicted to focus the text field and open the virtual keyboard, allowing for text input. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen (e.g., file list) is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The app drawer was opened by swiping up.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The \\'Copy\\' button is currently visible and enabled. This action is predicted to copy the selected text \\'f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' to the clipboard. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Copy\\' button was successful. The selected text \\'f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' was copied to the clipboard. This is confirmed by the toast message \\'f42GOjF Wb2aKH ogAFQSY\\' that appeared at the bottom left of the screen. The context menu at the top of the screen disappeared. The virtual keyboard remains visible. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button. Since the virtual keyboard is currently open, this action is predicted to close the virtual keyboard. The screen will then show the note editor without the keyboard, and the text selection might also be cleared. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the virtual keyboard. The screen changed from showing the note editor with the keyboard open to showing the note editor with its formatting toolbar at the bottom. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as closing the keyboard is a necessary step before the back button can navigate out of the editor. The next step is to press back again to return to the file list.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button. This action is predicted to navigate from the current note editor view of \\'2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md\\' back to Markor\\'s main file list screen, completing Subgoal 4. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully navigated from the note editor view of \\'2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md\\' back to the Markor file list screen. The screen now displays the list of files. This action completed Subgoal 4.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[864,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the red \\'+\\' button located in the bottom right corner of the screen. This button is currently visible and enabled. This action is predicted to open a dialog or a new screen for creating a new note. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'+\\' button successfully opened a dialog box for creating a new note. The dialog prompts for the note\\'s name, type, and template. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by initiating the note creation process.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[396,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text field currently showing \\'my_note\\' (center at approximately [396, 153]) to select it. This is predicted to focus the text field and open the virtual keyboard, allowing for text input. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the text field \\'my_note\\' was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, allowing for text input. The current text in the field is \\'my_note\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing for the input of the new note\\'s name.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Add a new line between the content of each note.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[99,223],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Copy\\' button in the context menu. The \\'Copy\\' button is currently visible and enabled. This action is predicted to copy the selected text \\'f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' to the clipboard. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Copy\\' button was successful. The selected text \\'f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' was copied to the clipboard. This is confirmed by the toast message \\'f42GOjF Wb2aKH ogAFQSY\\' that appeared at the bottom left of the screen. The context menu at the top of the screen disappeared. The virtual keyboard remains visible. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully retrieving the note\\'s content.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button. Since the virtual keyboard is currently open, this action is predicted to close the virtual keyboard. The screen will then show the note editor without the keyboard, and the text selection might also be cleared. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the virtual keyboard. The screen changed from showing the note editor with the keyboard open to showing the note editor with its formatting toolbar at the bottom. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as closing the keyboard is a necessary step before the back button can navigate out of the editor. The next step is to press back again to return to the file list.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button. This action is predicted to navigate from the current note editor view of \\'2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md\\' back to Markor\\'s main file list screen, completing Subgoal 4. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully navigated from the note editor view of \\'2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md\\' back to the Markor file list screen. The screen now displays the list of files. This action completed Subgoal 4.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[864,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the red \\'+\\' button located in the bottom right corner of the screen. This button is currently visible and enabled. This action is predicted to open a dialog or a new screen for creating a new note. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'+\\' button successfully opened a dialog box for creating a new note. The dialog prompts for the note\\'s name, type, and template. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by initiating the note creation process.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[396,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text field currently showing \\'my_note\\' (center at approximately [396, 153]) to select it. This is predicted to focus the text field and open the virtual keyboard, allowing for text input. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the text field \\'my_note\\' was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, allowing for text input. The current text in the field is \\'my_note\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing for the input of the new note\\'s name.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 19: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The text field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is predicted to clear the text field, making it ready for the new filename input.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Since the virtual keyboard is currently open, this action is predicted to close the virtual keyboard. The screen will then show the note editor without the keyboard, and the text selection might also be cleared. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the virtual keyboard. The screen changed from showing the note editor with the keyboard open to showing the note editor with its formatting toolbar at the bottom. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as closing the keyboard is a necessary step before the back button can navigate out of the editor.

This is predicted to focus the text field and open the virtual keyboard, allowing for text input. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the text field \\'my_note\\' was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, allowing for text input. The current text in the field is \\'my_note\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing for the input of the new note\\'s name.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field.

Actual Outcome: The `DELETE_TEXT` action failed. The text \\'my_note\\' was not deleted from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The text field still contains \\'my_note\\', remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is still open.

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Since the virtual keyboard is currently open, this action is predicted to close the virtual keyboard. The screen will then show the note editor without the keyboard, and the text selection might also be cleared. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the virtual keyboard. The screen changed from showing the note editor with the keyboard open to showing the note editor with its formatting toolbar at the bottom. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as closing the keyboard is a necessary step before the back button can navigate out of the editor. The next step is to press back again to return to the file list.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button. This action is predicted to navigate from the current note editor view of \\'2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md\\' back to Markor\\'s main file list screen, completing Subgoal 4. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully navigated from the note editor view of \\'2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md\\' back to the Markor file list screen. The screen now displays the list of files. This action completed Subgoal 4.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[864,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the red \\'+\\' button located in the bottom right corner of the screen. This button is currently visible and enabled. This action is predicted to open a dialog or a new screen for creating a new note. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'+\\' button successfully opened a dialog box for creating a new note. The dialog prompts for the note\\'s name, type, and template. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by initiating the note creation process.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[396,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text field currently showing \\'my_note\\' (center at approximately [396, 153]) to select it. This is predicted to focus the text field and open the virtual keyboard, allowing for text input. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the text field \\'my_note\\' was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, allowing for text input. The current text in the field is \\'my_note\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing for the input of the new note\\'s name.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The text field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is predicted to clear the text field, making it ready for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The `DELETE_TEXT` action failed. The text \\'my_note\\' was not deleted from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The text field still contains \\'my_note\\', remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is still open. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 20: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the focused \\'Name\\' text field.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution.

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is predicted to clear the text field, making it ready for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The `DELETE_TEXT` action failed. The text \\'my_note\\' was not deleted from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The text field still contains \\'my_note\\', remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is still open. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution.

Actual Outcome: The `DELETE_TEXT` action failed. The text \\'my_note\\' was not deleted from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The text field still contains \\'my_note\\', remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is still open.

The text field currently contains \\'my_note\\' and is focused. This action will be repeated 10 times as per the plan to ensure the field is cleared. This is the first of 10 planned `KEYCODE_DEL` events. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_DEL` action failed. The text \"my_note\" in the \\'Name\\' text field was not modified. The screen remains unchanged, with the new file dialog open and the text field focused. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[396,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text field currently showing \\'my_note\\' (center at approximately [396, 153]) to select it. This is predicted to focus the text field and open the virtual keyboard, allowing for text input. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the text field \\'my_note\\' was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, allowing for text input. The current text in the field is \\'my_note\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing for the input of the new note\\'s name.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The text field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is predicted to clear the text field, making it ready for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The `DELETE_TEXT` action failed. The text \\'my_note\\' was not deleted from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The text field still contains \\'my_note\\', remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is still open. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The text field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is predicted to clear the text field, making it ready for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The `DELETE_TEXT` action failed. The text \\'my_note\\' was not deleted from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The text field still contains \\'my_note\\', remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is still open. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The text field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is predicted to clear the text field, making it ready for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The `DELETE_TEXT` action failed. The text \\'my_note\\' was not deleted from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The text field still contains \\'my_note\\', remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is still open. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send \\'KEYCODE_DEL\\' key event to delete one character from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The text field currently contains \\'my_note\\' and is focused. This action will be repeated 10 times as per the plan to ensure the field is cleared. This is the first of 10 planned `KEYCODE_DEL` events. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_DEL` action failed. The text \"my_note\" in the \\'Name\\' text field was not modified. The screen remains unchanged, with the new file dialog open and the text field focused. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"mIObBbo4\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nMerge the contents of Markor notes tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt, proud_cat_edited.txt and 2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md (in the same order) into a new Markor note named mIObBbo4 and save it. Add a new line between the content of each note.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The text field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is predicted to clear the text field, making it ready for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The `DELETE_TEXT` action failed. The text \\'my_note\\' was not deleted from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The text field still contains \\'my_note\\', remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is still open. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The text field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is predicted to clear the text field, making it ready for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The `DELETE_TEXT` action failed. The text \\'my_note\\' was not deleted from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The text field still contains \\'my_note\\', remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is still open. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The text field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is predicted to clear the text field, making it ready for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The `DELETE_TEXT` action failed. The text \\'my_note\\' was not deleted from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The text field still contains \\'my_note\\', remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is still open. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send \\'KEYCODE_DEL\\' key event to delete one character from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The text field currently contains \\'my_note\\' and is focused. This action will be repeated 10 times as per the plan to ensure the field is cleared. This is the first of 10 planned `KEYCODE_DEL` events. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_DEL` action failed. The text \"my_note\" in the \\'Name\\' text field was not modified. The screen remains unchanged, with the new file dialog open and the text field focused. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The repeated failures to delete text necessitate a change in strategy.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"mIObBbo4\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'mIObBbo4\\' into the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The text field currently contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is predicted to replace \\'my_note\\' with \\'mIObBbo4\\' or append to it. Given the previous failures to delete, this is an attempt to directly set the filename. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'mIObBbo4\\' into the \\'Name\\' text field was successful. The text field now displays \\'mIObBbo4\\' instead of \\'my_note\\'. The \\'New file\\' dialog remains open, and the keyboard is still visible. This action has successfully set the desired filename and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 24: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[610,855],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button to confirm the filename and create the new note. The \\'OK\\' button is located at the bottom right of the \\'New file\\' dialog. This action is predicted to close the dialog and open the newly created note in the editor view.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The text field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is predicted to clear the text field, making it ready for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The `DELETE_TEXT` action failed. The text \\'my_note\\' was not deleted from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The text field still contains \\'my_note\\', remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is still open. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The text field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is predicted to clear the text field, making it ready for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The `DELETE_TEXT` action failed. The text \\'my_note\\' was not deleted from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The text field still contains \\'my_note\\', remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is still open. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send \\'KEYCODE_DEL\\' key event to delete one character from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The text field currently contains \\'my_note\\' and is focused. This action will be repeated 10 times as per the plan to ensure the field is cleared. This is the first of 10 planned `KEYCODE_DEL` events. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_DEL` action failed. The text \"my_note\" in the \\'Name\\' text field was not modified. The screen remains unchanged, with the new file dialog open and the text field focused. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The repeated failures to delete text necessitate a change in strategy.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"mIObBbo4\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'mIObBbo4\\' into the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The text field currently contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is predicted to replace \\'my_note\\' with \\'mIObBbo4\\' or append to it. Given the previous failures to delete, this is an attempt to directly set the filename. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'mIObBbo4\\' into the \\'Name\\' text field was successful. The text field now displays \\'mIObBbo4\\' instead of \\'my_note\\'. The \\'New file\\' dialog remains open, and the keyboard is still visible. This action has successfully set the desired filename and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[610,855],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button to confirm the filename and create the new note. The \\'OK\\' button is located at the bottom right of the \\'New file\\' dialog. This action is predicted to close the dialog and open the newly created note in the editor view. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'OK\\' button was successful. The \\'New file\\' dialog closed, and the Markor app opened a new, empty note titled \\'mIObBbo4\\' in the editor view. The virtual keyboard is visible, and the main text area of the note is focused, ready for input. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully creating the new note.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 43, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.47\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [74, 38, 96, 277], \\'text\\': \\'mlObBbo4\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [890, 143, 915, 336], \\'text\\': \\'= ,\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 653], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 836, 926, 929]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 907, 99, 985]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 244, 928, 343]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 598, 934, 698]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 823, 37, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 952, 924, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 482, 940, 575]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 618, 99, 702]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 721, 925, 813]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 11, 924, 101]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 714, 99, 799]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 128, 926, 224]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 364, 937, 459]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 811, 101, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 904, 37, 944]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 516, 98, 606]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [13, 44, 40, 207]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 422, 112, 512]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: NAF=\"true\", index=\"0\", text=\"\", resource-id=\"net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"net.gsantner.markor\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[0,275][1080,2102]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The text field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is predicted to clear the text field, making it ready for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The `DELETE_TEXT` action failed. The text \\'my_note\\' was not deleted from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The text field still contains \\'my_note\\', remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is still open. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The text field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is predicted to clear the text field, making it ready for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The `DELETE_TEXT` action failed. The text \\'my_note\\' was not deleted from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The text field still contains \\'my_note\\', remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is still open. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send \\'KEYCODE_DEL\\' key event to delete one character from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The text field currently contains \\'my_note\\' and is focused. This action will be repeated 10 times as per the plan to ensure the field is cleared. This is the first of 10 planned `KEYCODE_DEL` events. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_DEL` action failed. The text \"my_note\" in the \\'Name\\' text field was not modified. The screen remains unchanged, with the new file dialog open and the text field focused. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The repeated failures to delete text necessitate a change in strategy.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"mIObBbo4\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'mIObBbo4\\' into the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The text field currently contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is predicted to replace \\'my_note\\' with \\'mIObBbo4\\' or append to it. Given the previous failures to delete, this is an attempt to directly set the filename. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'mIObBbo4\\' into the \\'Name\\' text field was successful. The text field now displays \\'mIObBbo4\\' instead of \\'my_note\\'. The \\'New file\\' dialog remains open, and the keyboard is still visible. This action has successfully set the desired filename and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[610,855],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button to confirm the filename and create the new note. The \\'OK\\' button is located at the bottom right of the \\'New file\\' dialog. This action is predicted to close the dialog and open the newly created note in the editor view. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'OK\\' button was successful. The \\'New file\\' dialog closed, and the Markor app opened a new, empty note titled \\'mIObBbo4\\' in the editor view. The virtual keyboard is visible, and the main text area of the note is focused, ready for input. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully creating the new note.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 25: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' (content of \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\') into the focused editor text field of the note \\'mIObBbo4\\'.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The text field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is predicted to clear the text field, making it ready for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The `DELETE_TEXT` action failed. The text \\'my_note\\' was not deleted from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The text field still contains \\'my_note\\', remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is still open. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send \\'KEYCODE_DEL\\' key event to delete one character from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The text field currently contains \\'my_note\\' and is focused. This action will be repeated 10 times as per the plan to ensure the field is cleared. This is the first of 10 planned `KEYCODE_DEL` events. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_DEL` action failed. The text \"my_note\" in the \\'Name\\' text field was not modified. The screen remains unchanged, with the new file dialog open and the text field focused. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The repeated failures to delete text necessitate a change in strategy.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"mIObBbo4\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'mIObBbo4\\' into the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The text field currently contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is predicted to replace \\'my_note\\' with \\'mIObBbo4\\' or append to it. Given the previous failures to delete, this is an attempt to directly set the filename. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'mIObBbo4\\' into the \\'Name\\' text field was successful. The text field now displays \\'mIObBbo4\\' instead of \\'my_note\\'. The \\'New file\\' dialog remains open, and the keyboard is still visible. This action has successfully set the desired filename and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[610,855],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button to confirm the filename and create the new note. The \\'OK\\' button is located at the bottom right of the \\'New file\\' dialog. This action is predicted to close the dialog and open the newly created note in the editor view. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'OK\\' button was successful. The \\'New file\\' dialog closed, and the Markor app opened a new, empty note titled \\'mIObBbo4\\' in the editor view. The virtual keyboard is visible, and the main text area of the note is focused, ready for input. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully creating the new note.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' (content of \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\') into the focused editor text field of the note \\'mIObBbo4\\'. The text field is currently empty and focused. This action is predicted to populate the editor with the first note\\'s content. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' into the focused editor text field was successful. The editor now displays this text. The virtual keyboard is still visible, and the text field remains focused. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully adding the first piece of content to the new note.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Add a new line between the content of each note.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The text field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is predicted to clear the text field, making it ready for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The `DELETE_TEXT` action failed. The text \\'my_note\\' was not deleted from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The text field still contains \\'my_note\\', remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is still open. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send \\'KEYCODE_DEL\\' key event to delete one character from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The text field currently contains \\'my_note\\' and is focused. This action will be repeated 10 times as per the plan to ensure the field is cleared. This is the first of 10 planned `KEYCODE_DEL` events. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_DEL` action failed. The text \"my_note\" in the \\'Name\\' text field was not modified. The screen remains unchanged, with the new file dialog open and the text field focused. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The repeated failures to delete text necessitate a change in strategy.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"mIObBbo4\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'mIObBbo4\\' into the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The text field currently contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is predicted to replace \\'my_note\\' with \\'mIObBbo4\\' or append to it. Given the previous failures to delete, this is an attempt to directly set the filename. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'mIObBbo4\\' into the \\'Name\\' text field was successful. The text field now displays \\'mIObBbo4\\' instead of \\'my_note\\'. The \\'New file\\' dialog remains open, and the keyboard is still visible. This action has successfully set the desired filename and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[610,855],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button to confirm the filename and create the new note. The \\'OK\\' button is located at the bottom right of the \\'New file\\' dialog. This action is predicted to close the dialog and open the newly created note in the editor view. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'OK\\' button was successful. The \\'New file\\' dialog closed, and the Markor app opened a new, empty note titled \\'mIObBbo4\\' in the editor view. The virtual keyboard is visible, and the main text area of the note is focused, ready for input. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully creating the new note.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' (content of \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\') into the focused editor text field of the note \\'mIObBbo4\\'. The text field is currently empty and focused. This action is predicted to populate the editor with the first note\\'s content. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' into the focused editor text field was successful. The editor now displays this text. The virtual keyboard is still visible, and the text field remains focused. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully adding the first piece of content to the new note.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 26: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a \\'KEYCODE_ENTER\\' key event to input a newline character into the focused text editor. The editor currently contains \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' and is focused. This action is predicted to add a newline after the existing text, moving the cursor to the next line. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen (e.g., file list) is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The app drawer was opened by swiping up.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The \\'OK\\' button is located at the bottom right of the \\'New file\\' dialog. This action is predicted to close the dialog and open the newly created note in the editor view. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'OK\\' button was successful. The \\'New file\\' dialog closed, and the Markor app opened a new, empty note titled \\'mIObBbo4\\' in the editor view. The virtual keyboard is visible, and the main text area of the note is focused, ready for input. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully creating the new note.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' (content of \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\') into the focused editor text field of the note \\'mIObBbo4\\'. The text field is currently empty and focused. This action is predicted to populate the editor with the first note\\'s content. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' into the focused editor text field was successful. The editor now displays this text.

The text you can edit is: \"m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\n\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below.

Add a new line between the content of each note.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send \\'KEYCODE_DEL\\' key event to delete one character from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The text field currently contains \\'my_note\\' and is focused. This action will be repeated 10 times as per the plan to ensure the field is cleared. This is the first of 10 planned `KEYCODE_DEL` events. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_DEL` action failed. The text \"my_note\" in the \\'Name\\' text field was not modified. The screen remains unchanged, with the new file dialog open and the text field focused. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The repeated failures to delete text necessitate a change in strategy.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"mIObBbo4\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'mIObBbo4\\' into the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The text field currently contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is predicted to replace \\'my_note\\' with \\'mIObBbo4\\' or append to it. Given the previous failures to delete, this is an attempt to directly set the filename. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'mIObBbo4\\' into the \\'Name\\' text field was successful. The text field now displays \\'mIObBbo4\\' instead of \\'my_note\\'. The \\'New file\\' dialog remains open, and the keyboard is still visible. This action has successfully set the desired filename and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[610,855],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button to confirm the filename and create the new note. The \\'OK\\' button is located at the bottom right of the \\'New file\\' dialog. This action is predicted to close the dialog and open the newly created note in the editor view. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'OK\\' button was successful. The \\'New file\\' dialog closed, and the Markor app opened a new, empty note titled \\'mIObBbo4\\' in the editor view. The virtual keyboard is visible, and the main text area of the note is focused, ready for input. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully creating the new note.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' (content of \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\') into the focused editor text field of the note \\'mIObBbo4\\'. The text field is currently empty and focused. This action is predicted to populate the editor with the first note\\'s content. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' into the focused editor text field was successful. The editor now displays this text. The virtual keyboard is still visible, and the text field remains focused. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully adding the first piece of content to the new note.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a \\'KEYCODE_ENTER\\' key event to input a newline character into the focused text editor. The editor currently contains \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' and is focused. This action is predicted to add a newline after the existing text, moving the cursor to the next line. Actual Outcome: The action of sending `KEYCODE_ENTER` (keycode 66) was successful. A newline character was added to the text editor after \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\'. The cursor is now on the next line, ready for further input. This action successfully completed the planned step and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 27: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\' (content of \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\') into the focused editor text field.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text field currently contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is predicted to replace \\'my_note\\' with \\'mIObBbo4\\' or append to it. Given the previous failures to delete, this is an attempt to directly set the filename. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'mIObBbo4\\' into the \\'Name\\' text field was successful. The text field now displays \\'mIObBbo4\\' instead of \\'my_note\\'. The \\'New file\\' dialog remains open, and the keyboard is still visible.

The \\'OK\\' button is located at the bottom right of the \\'New file\\' dialog. This action is predicted to close the dialog and open the newly created note in the editor view. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'OK\\' button was successful. The \\'New file\\' dialog closed, and the Markor app opened a new, empty note titled \\'mIObBbo4\\' in the editor view. The virtual keyboard is visible, and the main text area of the note is focused, ready for input. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully creating the new note.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' (content of \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\') into the focused editor text field of the note \\'mIObBbo4\\'. The text field is currently empty and focused. This action is predicted to populate the editor with the first note\\'s content.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\n\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\nf42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nMerge the contents of Markor notes tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt, proud_cat_edited.txt and 2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md (in the same order) into a new Markor note named mIObBbo4 and save it. Add a new line between the content of each note.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[610,855],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button to confirm the filename and create the new note. The \\'OK\\' button is located at the bottom right of the \\'New file\\' dialog. This action is predicted to close the dialog and open the newly created note in the editor view. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'OK\\' button was successful. The \\'New file\\' dialog closed, and the Markor app opened a new, empty note titled \\'mIObBbo4\\' in the editor view. The virtual keyboard is visible, and the main text area of the note is focused, ready for input. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully creating the new note.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' (content of \\'tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt\\') into the focused editor text field of the note \\'mIObBbo4\\'. The text field is currently empty and focused. This action is predicted to populate the editor with the first note\\'s content. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' into the focused editor text field was successful. The editor now displays this text. The virtual keyboard is still visible, and the text field remains focused. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully adding the first piece of content to the new note.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a \\'KEYCODE_ENTER\\' key event to input a newline character into the focused text editor. The editor currently contains \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\' and is focused. This action is predicted to add a newline after the existing text, moving the cursor to the next line. Actual Outcome: The action of sending `KEYCODE_ENTER` (keycode 66) was successful. A newline character was added to the text editor after \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\'. The cursor is now on the next line, ready for further input. This action successfully completed the planned step and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the active subgoal.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\' (content of \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\') into the focused editor text field. The editor currently contains \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\n\\' and is focused. This action is predicted to append the second note\\'s content to the existing text.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\nf42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\n- [ ] f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The cursor is now on the next line, ready for further input. This action successfully completed the planned step and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the active subgoal.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\' (content of \\'proud_cat_edited.txt\\') into the focused editor text field.

Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \\'fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\' into the focused editor text field was successful. The editor now displays \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\'. The virtual keyboard is still visible, and the text field remains focused.

The editor currently contains \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\n\\' and is focused. This action is predicted to append the third note\\'s content to the existing text.

The icon is currently visible and enabled. This action is predicted to save the current note \\'mIObBbo4\\' with its merged content. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the checkmark icon at [903, 56] was unsuccessful in saving the note. Instead, it inserted \"- [ ] \" at the beginning of the last line of text, changing the content to \"m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\n- [ ] f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\". This action moved the agent further from completing the subgoal as the content is now incorrect and the note is not saved. The error was due to misidentifying the save button.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 31: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text editor.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The editor now displays \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\'. The virtual keyboard is still visible, and the text field remains focused. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully adding the second note\\'s content to the new note.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a \\'KEYCODE_ENTER\\' key event to input a newline character into the focused text editor. The editor currently contains \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\' and is focused. This action is predicted to add a newline after the existing text, moving the cursor to the next line. Actual Outcome: The action of sending `KEYCODE_ENTER` (keycode 66) was successful. A newline character was added to the text editor after \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\'. The cursor is now on the next line, ready for further input. This action successfully completed the planned step and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the active subgoal.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' (content of \\'2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md\\') into the focused editor text field. The editor currently contains \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\n\\' and is focused. This action is predicted to append the third note\\'s content to the existing text. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \\'f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' into the focused editor text field was successful. The editor now displays the merged content of all three notes: \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\nf42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\'. The virtual keyboard is still visible, and the text field remains focused. This action brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal, as all required content has now been added to the new note.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[903,56],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkmark icon (save button) located at the bottom left of the screen. The icon is currently visible and enabled. This action is predicted to save the current note \\'mIObBbo4\\' with its merged content. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the checkmark icon at [903, 56] was unsuccessful in saving the note. Instead, it inserted \"- [ ] \" at the beginning of the last line of text, changing the content to \"m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\n- [ ] f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\". This action moved the agent further from completing the subgoal as the content is now incorrect and the note is not saved. The error was due to misidentifying the save button.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text editor. The editor currently contains \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\n- [ ] f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\'. This action is predicted to clear the text field, leaving it empty and ready for new input. Actual Outcome: The action of deleting all text from the focused text editor was successful. The editor is now empty, as confirmed by the screenshot and XML data. This action corrected the error from the previous step and brought the agent back on track to complete the active subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The editor currently contains \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\n\\' and is focused. This action is predicted to append the third note\\'s content to the existing text. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \\'f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' into the focused editor text field was successful. The editor now displays the merged content of all three notes: \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\nf42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\'. The virtual keyboard is still visible, and the text field remains focused. This action brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal, as all required content has now been added to the new note.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[903,56],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkmark icon (save button) located at the bottom left of the screen. The icon is currently visible and enabled. This action is predicted to save the current note \\'mIObBbo4\\' with its merged content. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the checkmark icon at [903, 56] was unsuccessful in saving the note. Instead, it inserted \"- [ ] \" at the beginning of the last line of text, changing the content to \"m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\n- [ ] f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\". This action moved the agent further from completing the subgoal as the content is now incorrect and the note is not saved. The error was due to misidentifying the save button.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text editor. The editor currently contains \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\n- [ ] f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\'. This action is predicted to clear the text field, leaving it empty and ready for new input. Actual Outcome: The action of deleting all text from the focused text editor was successful. The editor is now empty, as confirmed by the screenshot and XML data. This action corrected the error from the previous step and brought the agent back on track to complete the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 32: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\nf42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the merged text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\nf42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' into the focused editor text field. The editor is currently empty and focused. This action is predicted to populate the editor with the correct merged content, with each note\\'s content on a new line.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[903,56],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkmark icon (save button) located at the bottom left of the screen. The icon is currently visible and enabled. This action is predicted to save the current note \\'mIObBbo4\\' with its merged content. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the checkmark icon at [903, 56] was unsuccessful in saving the note. Instead, it inserted \"- [ ] \" at the beginning of the last line of text, changing the content to \"m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\n- [ ] f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\". This action moved the agent further from completing the subgoal as the content is now incorrect and the note is not saved. The error was due to misidentifying the save button.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text editor. The editor currently contains \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\n- [ ] f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\'. This action is predicted to clear the text field, leaving it empty and ready for new input. Actual Outcome: The action of deleting all text from the focused text editor was successful. The editor is now empty, as confirmed by the screenshot and XML data. This action corrected the error from the previous step and brought the agent back on track to complete the active subgoal.\\n Step 32: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\nf42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the merged text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\nf42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' into the focused editor text field. The editor is currently empty and focused. This action is predicted to populate the editor with the correct merged content, with each note\\'s content on a new line. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the merged text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\nf42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' into the focused editor text field was successful. The editor now displays the correct merged content, as confirmed by the screenshot and the XML data. The virtual keyboard is still visible, and the text field remains focused. This action successfully restored the correct content to the note, bringing the agent back on track to complete the active subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\nf42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### Screen Information Text After the Action ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 43, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.55\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [74, 38, 96, 277], \\'text\\': \\'mlObBbo4\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [134, 33, 195, 470], \\'text\\': \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [890, 143, 915, 336], \\'text\\': \\'= ,\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 653], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 910, 100, 983]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 822, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 837, 926, 928]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 620, 99, 700]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 598, 934, 697]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 813, 102, 895]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 953, 924, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 242, 928, 342]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 12, 924, 100]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 723, 924, 812]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 485, 933, 575]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 718, 100, 795]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 129, 926, 224]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 520, 98, 606]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 905, 37, 943]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 363, 934, 459]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"0\", text=\"m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\nf42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\", resource-id=\"net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"net.gsantner.markor\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[0,275][1080,2102]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from.

Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nMerge the contents of Markor notes tough_frog_2023_08_05.txt, proud_cat_edited.txt and 2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md (in the same order) into a new Markor note named mIObBbo4 and save it. Add a new line between the content of each note.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a \\'KEYCODE_ENTER\\' key event to input a newline character into the focused text editor. The editor currently contains \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\' and is focused. This action is predicted to add a newline after the existing text, moving the cursor to the next line. Actual Outcome: The action of sending `KEYCODE_ENTER` (keycode 66) was successful. A newline character was added to the text editor after \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\'. The cursor is now on the next line, ready for further input. This action successfully completed the planned step and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the active subgoal.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' (content of \\'2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md\\') into the focused editor text field. The editor currently contains \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\n\\' and is focused. This action is predicted to append the third note\\'s content to the existing text. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \\'f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' into the focused editor text field was successful. The editor now displays the merged content of all three notes: \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\nf42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\'. The virtual keyboard is still visible, and the text field remains focused. This action brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal, as all required content has now been added to the new note.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[903,56],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkmark icon (save button) located at the bottom left of the screen. The icon is currently visible and enabled. This action is predicted to save the current note \\'mIObBbo4\\' with its merged content. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the checkmark icon at [903, 56] was unsuccessful in saving the note. Instead, it inserted \"- [ ] \" at the beginning of the last line of text, changing the content to \"m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\n- [ ] f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\". This action moved the agent further from completing the subgoal as the content is now incorrect and the note is not saved. The error was due to misidentifying the save button.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text editor. The editor currently contains \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\n- [ ] f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\'. This action is predicted to clear the text field, leaving it empty and ready for new input. Actual Outcome: The action of deleting all text from the focused text editor was successful. The editor is now empty, as confirmed by the screenshot and XML data. This action corrected the error from the previous step and brought the agent back on track to complete the active subgoal.\\n Step 32: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\nf42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the merged text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\nf42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' into the focused editor text field. The editor is currently empty and focused. This action is predicted to populate the editor with the correct merged content, with each note\\'s content on a new line. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the merged text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\nf42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' into the focused editor text field was successful. The editor now displays the correct merged content, as confirmed by the screenshot and the XML data. The virtual keyboard is still visible, and the text field remains focused. This action successfully restored the correct content to the note, bringing the agent back on track to complete the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 33: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the save icon (floppy disk) located at the top of the screen, approximately at [84, 757]. The note \\'mIObBbo4\\' with the merged content is currently open in the editor. This action is predicted to save the note.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The editor currently contains \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\n\\' and is focused. This action is predicted to append the third note\\'s content to the existing text. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \\'f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' into the focused editor text field was successful. The editor now displays the merged content of all three notes: \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\nf42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\'. The virtual keyboard is still visible, and the text field remains focused. This action brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal, as all required content has now been added to the new note.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[903,56],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkmark icon (save button) located at the bottom left of the screen. The icon is currently visible and enabled. This action is predicted to save the current note \\'mIObBbo4\\' with its merged content. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the checkmark icon at [903, 56] was unsuccessful in saving the note. Instead, it inserted \"- [ ] \" at the beginning of the last line of text, changing the content to \"m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\n- [ ] f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\". This action moved the agent further from completing the subgoal as the content is now incorrect and the note is not saved. The error was due to misidentifying the save button.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text editor. The editor currently contains \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\n- [ ] f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\'. This action is predicted to clear the text field, leaving it empty and ready for new input. Actual Outcome: The action of deleting all text from the focused text editor was successful. The editor is now empty, as confirmed by the screenshot and XML data. This action corrected the error from the previous step and brought the agent back on track to complete the active subgoal.\\n Step 32: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\nf42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the merged text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\nf42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' into the focused editor text field. The editor is currently empty and focused. This action is predicted to populate the editor with the correct merged content, with each note\\'s content on a new line. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the merged text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\nf42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' into the focused editor text field was successful. The editor now displays the correct merged content, as confirmed by the screenshot and the XML data. The virtual keyboard is still visible, and the text field remains focused. This action successfully restored the correct content to the note, bringing the agent back on track to complete the active subgoal.\\n Step 33: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the save icon (floppy disk) located at the top of the screen, approximately at [84, 757]. The note \\'mIObBbo4\\' with the merged content is currently open in the editor. This action is predicted to save the note. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping at [84, 757] targeted the search icon, not a save icon. Consequently, the note was not saved. The application remains in the note editor view, the text content is unchanged (\\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\nf42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\'), and the virtual keyboard is still active. This action was a failure as it did not bring the agent closer to saving the note. The wrong UI element was targeted.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 43, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.55\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [74, 38, 96, 277], \\'text\\': \\'mlObBbo4\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [134, 33, 195, 470], \\'text\\': \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [890, 143, 915, 336], \\'text\\': \\'= ,\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 653], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 910, 100, 983]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 822, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 837, 926, 928]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 620, 99, 700]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 598, 934, 697]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 813, 102, 895]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 953, 924, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 242, 928, 342]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 12, 924, 100]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 723, 924, 812]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 485, 933, 575]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 718, 100, 795]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 129, 926, 224]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 520, 98, 606]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 905, 37, 943]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 363, 934, 459]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"0\", text=\"m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\nf42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\", resource-id=\"net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"net.gsantner.markor\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[0,275][1080,2102]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\nf42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Add a new line between the content of each note.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' (content of \\'2023_08_21_friendly_koala.md\\') into the focused editor text field. The editor currently contains \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\n\\' and is focused. This action is predicted to append the third note\\'s content to the existing text. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \\'f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' into the focused editor text field was successful. The editor now displays the merged content of all three notes: \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\nf42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\'. The virtual keyboard is still visible, and the text field remains focused. This action brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal, as all required content has now been added to the new note.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[903,56],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkmark icon (save button) located at the bottom left of the screen. The icon is currently visible and enabled. This action is predicted to save the current note \\'mIObBbo4\\' with its merged content. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the checkmark icon at [903, 56] was unsuccessful in saving the note. Instead, it inserted \"- [ ] \" at the beginning of the last line of text, changing the content to \"m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\n- [ ] f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\". This action moved the agent further from completing the subgoal as the content is now incorrect and the note is not saved. The error was due to misidentifying the save button.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text editor. The editor currently contains \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\n- [ ] f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\'. This action is predicted to clear the text field, leaving it empty and ready for new input. Actual Outcome: The action of deleting all text from the focused text editor was successful. The editor is now empty, as confirmed by the screenshot and XML data. This action corrected the error from the previous step and brought the agent back on track to complete the active subgoal.\\n Step 32: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\nf42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the merged text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\nf42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' into the focused editor text field. The editor is currently empty and focused. This action is predicted to populate the editor with the correct merged content, with each note\\'s content on a new line. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the merged text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\nf42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' into the focused editor text field was successful. The editor now displays the correct merged content, as confirmed by the screenshot and the XML data. The virtual keyboard is still visible, and the text field remains focused. This action successfully restored the correct content to the note, bringing the agent back on track to complete the active subgoal.\\n Step 33: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the save icon (floppy disk) located at the top of the screen, approximately at [84, 757]. The note \\'mIObBbo4\\' with the merged content is currently open in the editor. This action is predicted to save the note. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping at [84, 757] targeted the search icon, not a save icon. Consequently, the note was not saved. The application remains in the note editor view, the text content is unchanged (\\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\nf42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\'), and the virtual keyboard is still active. This action was a failure as it did not bring the agent closer to saving the note. The wrong UI element was targeted.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 34: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a `KEYCODE_BACK` event. The virtual keyboard is currently open. This action is predicted to close the virtual keyboard, leaving the note editor visible.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[903,56],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkmark icon (save button) located at the bottom left of the screen. The icon is currently visible and enabled. This action is predicted to save the current note \\'mIObBbo4\\' with its merged content. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the checkmark icon at [903, 56] was unsuccessful in saving the note. Instead, it inserted \"- [ ] \" at the beginning of the last line of text, changing the content to \"m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\n- [ ] f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\". This action moved the agent further from completing the subgoal as the content is now incorrect and the note is not saved. The error was due to misidentifying the save button.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text editor. The editor currently contains \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\n- [ ] f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\'. This action is predicted to clear the text field, leaving it empty and ready for new input. Actual Outcome: The action of deleting all text from the focused text editor was successful. The editor is now empty, as confirmed by the screenshot and XML data. This action corrected the error from the previous step and brought the agent back on track to complete the active subgoal.\\n Step 32: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\nf42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the merged text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\nf42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' into the focused editor text field. The editor is currently empty and focused. This action is predicted to populate the editor with the correct merged content, with each note\\'s content on a new line. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the merged text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\nf42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' into the focused editor text field was successful. The editor now displays the correct merged content, as confirmed by the screenshot and the XML data. The virtual keyboard is still visible, and the text field remains focused. This action successfully restored the correct content to the note, bringing the agent back on track to complete the active subgoal.\\n Step 33: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the save icon (floppy disk) located at the top of the screen, approximately at [84, 757]. The note \\'mIObBbo4\\' with the merged content is currently open in the editor. This action is predicted to save the note. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping at [84, 757] targeted the search icon, not a save icon. Consequently, the note was not saved. The application remains in the note editor view, the text content is unchanged (\\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\nf42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\'), and the virtual keyboard is still active. This action was a failure as it did not bring the agent closer to saving the note. The wrong UI element was targeted.\\n Step 34: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a `KEYCODE_BACK` event. The virtual keyboard is currently open. This action is predicted to close the virtual keyboard, leaving the note editor visible. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the virtual keyboard. The note editor is still visible with the merged content. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing for the next step of saving the note.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 43, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.55\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [74, 38, 96, 277], \\'text\\': \\'mlObBbo4\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [134, 33, 195, 475], \\'text\\': \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd fxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [938, 150, 962, 332], \\'text\\': \\'= ,\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 835, 972, 929]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [931, 719, 968, 812]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 952, 971, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [930, 484, 969, 576]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [932, 605, 967, 691]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 822, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 910, 100, 983]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 619, 99, 701]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 367, 972, 455]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [928, 243, 972, 343]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 129, 971, 225]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 812, 102, 895]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [930, 11, 971, 102]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 905, 36, 943]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 718, 100, 796]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 519, 98, 606]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [985, 362, 1000, 634]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Add a new line between the content of each note.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[903,56],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkmark icon (save button) located at the bottom left of the screen. The icon is currently visible and enabled. This action is predicted to save the current note \\'mIObBbo4\\' with its merged content. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the checkmark icon at [903, 56] was unsuccessful in saving the note. Instead, it inserted \"- [ ] \" at the beginning of the last line of text, changing the content to \"m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\n- [ ] f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\". This action moved the agent further from completing the subgoal as the content is now incorrect and the note is not saved. The error was due to misidentifying the save button.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text editor. The editor currently contains \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\n- [ ] f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\'. This action is predicted to clear the text field, leaving it empty and ready for new input. Actual Outcome: The action of deleting all text from the focused text editor was successful. The editor is now empty, as confirmed by the screenshot and XML data. This action corrected the error from the previous step and brought the agent back on track to complete the active subgoal.\\n Step 32: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\nf42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the merged text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\nf42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' into the focused editor text field. The editor is currently empty and focused. This action is predicted to populate the editor with the correct merged content, with each note\\'s content on a new line. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the merged text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\nf42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' into the focused editor text field was successful. The editor now displays the correct merged content, as confirmed by the screenshot and the XML data. The virtual keyboard is still visible, and the text field remains focused. This action successfully restored the correct content to the note, bringing the agent back on track to complete the active subgoal.\\n Step 33: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the save icon (floppy disk) located at the top of the screen, approximately at [84, 757]. The note \\'mIObBbo4\\' with the merged content is currently open in the editor. This action is predicted to save the note. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping at [84, 757] targeted the search icon, not a save icon. Consequently, the note was not saved. The application remains in the note editor view, the text content is unchanged (\\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\nf42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\'), and the virtual keyboard is still active. This action was a failure as it did not bring the agent closer to saving the note. The wrong UI element was targeted.\\n Step 34: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a `KEYCODE_BACK` event. The virtual keyboard is currently open. This action is predicted to close the virtual keyboard, leaving the note editor visible. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the virtual keyboard. The note editor is still visible with the merged content. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing for the next step of saving the note.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 35: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a `KEYCODE_BACK` event. The note editor for \\'mIObBbo4\\' is currently open, and the virtual keyboard is closed. This action is predicted to navigate away from the editor, potentially prompting the user to save the changes made to the note.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The editor currently contains \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\n- [ ] f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\'. This action is predicted to clear the text field, leaving it empty and ready for new input. Actual Outcome: The action of deleting all text from the focused text editor was successful. The editor is now empty, as confirmed by the screenshot and XML data. This action corrected the error from the previous step and brought the agent back on track to complete the active subgoal.\\n Step 32: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\nf42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the merged text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\nf42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' into the focused editor text field. The editor is currently empty and focused. This action is predicted to populate the editor with the correct merged content, with each note\\'s content on a new line. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the merged text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\nf42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' into the focused editor text field was successful. The editor now displays the correct merged content, as confirmed by the screenshot and the XML data. The virtual keyboard is still visible, and the text field remains focused. This action successfully restored the correct content to the note, bringing the agent back on track to complete the active subgoal.\\n Step 33: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the save icon (floppy disk) located at the top of the screen, approximately at [84, 757]. The note \\'mIObBbo4\\' with the merged content is currently open in the editor. This action is predicted to save the note. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping at [84, 757] targeted the search icon, not a save icon. Consequently, the note was not saved. The application remains in the note editor view, the text content is unchanged (\\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\nf42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\'), and the virtual keyboard is still active. This action was a failure as it did not bring the agent closer to saving the note.

The virtual keyboard is currently open. This action is predicted to close the virtual keyboard, leaving the note editor visible. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the virtual keyboard. The note editor is still visible with the merged content. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing for the next step of saving the note.\\n Step 35: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a `KEYCODE_BACK` event. The note editor for \\'mIObBbo4\\' is currently open, and the virtual keyboard is closed. This action is predicted to navigate away from the editor, potentially prompting the user to save the changes made to the note. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully navigated from the note editor view of \\'mIObBbo4\\' to the Markor file list. The note \\'mIObBbo4.txt\\' is now visible in the file list with a timestamp indicating it was recently modified/saved (10/15/2023, 15:55). This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the note appears to be saved. The next step is to verify its content.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text editor. The editor currently contains \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\n- [ ] f42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\'. This action is predicted to clear the text field, leaving it empty and ready for new input. Actual Outcome: The action of deleting all text from the focused text editor was successful. The editor is now empty, as confirmed by the screenshot and XML data. This action corrected the error from the previous step and brought the agent back on track to complete the active subgoal.\\n Step 32: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\nf42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the merged text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\nf42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' into the focused editor text field. The editor is currently empty and focused. This action is predicted to populate the editor with the correct merged content, with each note\\'s content on a new line. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the merged text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\nf42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' into the focused editor text field was successful. The editor now displays the correct merged content, as confirmed by the screenshot and the XML data. The virtual keyboard is still visible, and the text field remains focused. This action successfully restored the correct content to the note, bringing the agent back on track to complete the active subgoal.\\n Step 33: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the save icon (floppy disk) located at the top of the screen, approximately at [84, 757]. The note \\'mIObBbo4\\' with the merged content is currently open in the editor. This action is predicted to save the note. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping at [84, 757] targeted the search icon, not a save icon. Consequently, the note was not saved. The application remains in the note editor view, the text content is unchanged (\\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\nf42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\'), and the virtual keyboard is still active.

The virtual keyboard is currently open. This action is predicted to close the virtual keyboard, leaving the note editor visible. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the virtual keyboard. The note editor is still visible with the merged content. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing for the next step of saving the note.\\n Step 35: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a `KEYCODE_BACK` event. The note editor for \\'mIObBbo4\\' is currently open, and the virtual keyboard is closed. This action is predicted to navigate away from the editor, potentially prompting the user to save the changes made to the note. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully navigated from the note editor view of \\'mIObBbo4\\' to the Markor file list. The note \\'mIObBbo4.txt\\' is now visible in the file list with a timestamp indicating it was recently modified/saved (10/15/2023, 15:55). This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the note appears to be saved.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The note \\'mIObBbo4\\' with the merged content is currently open in the editor. This action is predicted to save the note. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping at [84, 757] targeted the search icon, not a save icon. Consequently, the note was not saved. The application remains in the note editor view, the text content is unchanged (\\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\nf42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\'), and the virtual keyboard is still active. This action was a failure as it did not bring the agent closer to saving the note.

Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the virtual keyboard. The note editor is still visible with the merged content. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing for the next step of saving the note.\\n Step 35: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a `KEYCODE_BACK` event. The note editor for \\'mIObBbo4\\' is currently open, and the virtual keyboard is closed. This action is predicted to navigate away from the editor, potentially prompting the user to save the changes made to the note. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully navigated from the note editor view of \\'mIObBbo4\\' to the Markor file list. The note \\'mIObBbo4.txt\\' is now visible in the file list with a timestamp indicating it was recently modified/saved (10/15/2023, 15:55).

Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'mIObBbo4.txt\\' at [321, 296] successfully opened the note. The content of the note is \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\nf42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\', which is the correct merged content.

When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Add a new line between the content of each note.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 32: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\nf42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the merged text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\nf42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' into the focused editor text field. The editor is currently empty and focused. This action is predicted to populate the editor with the correct merged content, with each note\\'s content on a new line. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the merged text \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\nf42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\' into the focused editor text field was successful. The editor now displays the correct merged content, as confirmed by the screenshot and the XML data. The virtual keyboard is still visible, and the text field remains focused. This action successfully restored the correct content to the note, bringing the agent back on track to complete the active subgoal.\\n Step 33: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the save icon (floppy disk) located at the top of the screen, approximately at [84, 757]. The note \\'mIObBbo4\\' with the merged content is currently open in the editor. This action is predicted to save the note. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping at [84, 757] targeted the search icon, not a save icon. Consequently, the note was not saved. The application remains in the note editor view, the text content is unchanged (\\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\nf42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\'), and the virtual keyboard is still active. This action was a failure as it did not bring the agent closer to saving the note.

The virtual keyboard is currently open. This action is predicted to close the virtual keyboard, leaving the note editor visible. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the virtual keyboard. The note editor is still visible with the merged content. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing for the next step of saving the note.\\n Step 35: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a `KEYCODE_BACK` event. The note editor for \\'mIObBbo4\\' is currently open, and the virtual keyboard is closed. This action is predicted to navigate away from the editor, potentially prompting the user to save the changes made to the note. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully navigated from the note editor view of \\'mIObBbo4\\' to the Markor file list. The note \\'mIObBbo4.txt\\' is now visible in the file list with a timestamp indicating it was recently modified/saved (10/15/2023, 15:55). This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the note appears to be saved. The next step is to verify its content.\\n Step 36: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[321,296],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'mIObBbo4.txt\\' to open it. The note is listed in the file view. This action is predicted to open the note in the editor view, allowing its content to be verified. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'mIObBbo4.txt\\' at [321, 296] successfully opened the note. The content of the note is \\'m4kMyOGWaENoPj6FqLjd\\\\nfxHXZsqrmnwYjXvte9pg\\\\nf42GOjFWbZaKHogAFQSY\\', which is the correct merged content. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing verification of the note\\'s content.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 37: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a `KEYCODE_BACK` event.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",
