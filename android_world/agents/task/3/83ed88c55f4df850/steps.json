If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13.

For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16.

If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The current screen is the home screen. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to find and open \\'Simple Gallery\\' from this app drawer.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

This action is intended to open the Simple Gallery app. The \\'Gallery\\' app icon is currently visible on the screen. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Gallery\\' icon at [736,397] did not open an application or change the screen. The device remains in the app drawer. This action was a failure because the target was to open \\'Simple Gallery\\', but the tapped icon was for an app named \\'Gallery\\', and in any case, no app opened.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The current screen is the home screen. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to find and open \\'Simple Gallery\\' from this app drawer.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[736,397],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Gallery\\' app icon, which is an orange circle with a white mountain and sun, located in the app drawer. This action is intended to open the Simple Gallery app. The \\'Gallery\\' app icon is currently visible on the screen. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Gallery\\' icon at [736,397] did not open an application or change the screen. The device remains in the app drawer. This action was a failure because the target was to open \\'Simple Gallery\\', but the tapped icon was for an app named \\'Gallery\\', and in any case, no app opened. The agent needs to scroll to find the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app and then tap on it.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the lower part of the screen (y=800, x=500) to the upper part of the screen (y=300, x=500) to scroll down the app drawer. This is done to find the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app, which is not currently visible. The app drawer is currently displayed. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, revealing more applications. This action was successful and brings the agent closer to finding and opening the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app. The next step is to identify and tap on the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app icon, which might be labeled as \\'Photos\\'.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 3: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[648,168],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Photos\\' app icon, which is a colorful pinwheel, located in the app drawer. The center of the icon is approximately at [648, 168]. This action is intended to open the Simple Gallery app. The \\'Photos\\' app icon is currently visible on the screen.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The current screen is the home screen. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to find and open \\'Simple Gallery\\' from this app drawer.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[736,397],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Gallery\\' app icon, which is an orange circle with a white mountain and sun, located in the app drawer. This action is intended to open the Simple Gallery app. The \\'Gallery\\' app icon is currently visible on the screen. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Gallery\\' icon at [736,397] did not open an application or change the screen. The device remains in the app drawer. This action was a failure because the target was to open \\'Simple Gallery\\', but the tapped icon was for an app named \\'Gallery\\', and in any case, no app opened. The agent needs to scroll to find the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app and then tap on it.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the lower part of the screen (y=800, x=500) to the upper part of the screen (y=300, x=500) to scroll down the app drawer. This is done to find the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app, which is not currently visible. The app drawer is currently displayed. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, revealing more applications. This action was successful and brings the agent closer to finding and opening the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app. The next step is to identify and tap on the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app icon, which might be labeled as \\'Photos\\'.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[648,168],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Photos\\' app icon, which is a colorful pinwheel, located in the app drawer. The center of the icon is approximately at [648, 168]. This action is intended to open the Simple Gallery app. The \\'Photos\\' app icon is currently visible on the screen. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Photos\\' icon at [648, 168] resulted in opening the \\'Google Photos\\' application, not \\'Simple Gallery\\'. This is evident from the \\'Google Photos\\' title, the \\'Backup is off\\' message, and the \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up with a \\'Sign in to back up\\' button. This action was a failure as it did not open the intended application and therefore did not progress towards completing the active subgoal. To correct this, Google Photos needs to be closed, and a new search for \\'Simple Gallery\\' in the app drawer must be performed.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.36\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 115, 650], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0 [Xv: 0.0 [Yv: 0.0 Google Photos Backup is off\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [142, 34, 162, 207], \\'text\\': \\'TestAgent\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [686, 181, 721, 819], \\'text\\': \\'Keep your memories safe\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [737, 110, 777, 894], \\'text\\': \\'Your photos & videos will be securely backed up to Google Photos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [832, 331, 856, 669], \\'text\\': \\'Sign in to back up\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [886, 47, 940, 957], \\'text\\': \\'Your photos videos will back up in Original quality. You can turn off or manage backup at any time in Settings. Google Photos uses face grouping: Learn more\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [820, 33, 866, 970]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [920, 523, 938, 685]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [70, 874, 110, 970]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The agent needs to scroll to find the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app and then tap on it.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the lower part of the screen (y=800, x=500) to the upper part of the screen (y=300, x=500) to scroll down the app drawer. This is done to find the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app, which is not currently visible. The app drawer is currently displayed. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, revealing more applications. This action was successful and brings the agent closer to finding and opening the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app. The next step is to identify and tap on the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app icon, which might be labeled as \\'Photos\\'.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

The center of the icon is approximately at [648, 168]. This action is intended to open the Simple Gallery app. The \\'Photos\\' app icon is currently visible on the screen. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Photos\\' icon at [648, 168] resulted in opening the \\'Google Photos\\' application, not \\'Simple Gallery\\'. This is evident from the \\'Google Photos\\' title, the \\'Backup is off\\' message, and the \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up with a \\'Sign in to back up\\' button. This action was a failure as it did not open the intended application and therefore did not progress towards completing the active subgoal. To correct this, Google Photos needs to be closed, and a new search for \\'Simple Gallery\\' in the app drawer must be performed.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 4: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button (keycode 4) to close the Google Photos app and the \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.37\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'[Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'[Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [75, 337, 104, 666], \\'text\\': \\'Google Photos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [141, 33, 162, 207], \\'text\\': \\'TestAgent\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [278, 46, 283, 200], \\'text\\': \\'26oyreruiss\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [686, 181, 721, 819], \\'text\\': \\'Keep your memories safe\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [737, 110, 777, 894], \\'text\\': \\'Your photos & videos will be securely backed up to Google Photos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [832, 331, 856, 669], \\'text\\': \\'Sign in to back up\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [886, 47, 940, 957], \\'text\\': \\'Your photos videos will back up in Original quality.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders.

Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The current screen is the home screen. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to find and open \\'Simple Gallery\\' from this app drawer.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[736,397],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Gallery\\' app icon, which is an orange circle with a white mountain and sun, located in the app drawer. This action is intended to open the Simple Gallery app. The \\'Gallery\\' app icon is currently visible on the screen. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Gallery\\' icon at [736,397] did not open an application or change the screen. The device remains in the app drawer. This action was a failure because the target was to open \\'Simple Gallery\\', but the tapped icon was for an app named \\'Gallery\\', and in any case, no app opened. The agent needs to scroll to find the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app and then tap on it.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the lower part of the screen (y=800, x=500) to the upper part of the screen (y=300, x=500) to scroll down the app drawer. This is done to find the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app, which is not currently visible. The app drawer is currently displayed. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, revealing more applications. This action was successful and brings the agent closer to finding and opening the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app. The next step is to identify and tap on the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app icon, which might be labeled as \\'Photos\\'.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[648,168],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Photos\\' app icon, which is a colorful pinwheel, located in the app drawer. The center of the icon is approximately at [648, 168]. This action is intended to open the Simple Gallery app. The \\'Photos\\' app icon is currently visible on the screen. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Photos\\' icon at [648, 168] resulted in opening the \\'Google Photos\\' application, not \\'Simple Gallery\\'. This is evident from the \\'Google Photos\\' title, the \\'Backup is off\\' message, and the \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up with a \\'Sign in to back up\\' button. This action was a failure as it did not open the intended application and therefore did not progress towards completing the active subgoal. To correct this, Google Photos needs to be closed, and a new search for \\'Simple Gallery\\' in the app drawer must be performed.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button (keycode 4) to close the Google Photos app and the \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up. This action is intended to return to the app drawer, allowing the agent to continue searching for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app. The current screen is Google Photos with a pop-up. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) did not close the Google Photos app or the \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up. The screen remains on Google Photos with the pop-up visible. The action was a failure as it did not return the agent to the app drawer to continue searching for \\'Simple Gallery\\'.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 5: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button (keycode 4) again to attempt to close the Google Photos pop-up or the app itself. The current screen is Google Photos with a \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up. The predicted outcome is that the pop-up will close, or the Google Photos app will close, returning the agent to the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[736,397],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Gallery\\' app icon, which is an orange circle with a white mountain and sun, located in the app drawer. This action is intended to open the Simple Gallery app. The \\'Gallery\\' app icon is currently visible on the screen. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Gallery\\' icon at [736,397] did not open an application or change the screen. The device remains in the app drawer. This action was a failure because the target was to open \\'Simple Gallery\\', but the tapped icon was for an app named \\'Gallery\\', and in any case, no app opened. The agent needs to scroll to find the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app and then tap on it.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the lower part of the screen (y=800, x=500) to the upper part of the screen (y=300, x=500) to scroll down the app drawer. This is done to find the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app, which is not currently visible. The app drawer is currently displayed. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, revealing more applications. This action was successful and brings the agent closer to finding and opening the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app. The next step is to identify and tap on the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app icon, which might be labeled as \\'Photos\\'.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[648,168],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Photos\\' app icon, which is a colorful pinwheel, located in the app drawer. The center of the icon is approximately at [648, 168]. This action is intended to open the Simple Gallery app. The \\'Photos\\' app icon is currently visible on the screen. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Photos\\' icon at [648, 168] resulted in opening the \\'Google Photos\\' application, not \\'Simple Gallery\\'. This is evident from the \\'Google Photos\\' title, the \\'Backup is off\\' message, and the \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up with a \\'Sign in to back up\\' button. This action was a failure as it did not open the intended application and therefore did not progress towards completing the active subgoal. To correct this, Google Photos needs to be closed, and a new search for \\'Simple Gallery\\' in the app drawer must be performed.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button (keycode 4) to close the Google Photos app and the \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up. This action is intended to return to the app drawer, allowing the agent to continue searching for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app. The current screen is Google Photos with a pop-up. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) did not close the Google Photos app or the \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up. The screen remains on Google Photos with the pop-up visible. The action was a failure as it did not return the agent to the app drawer to continue searching for \\'Simple Gallery\\'.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button (keycode 4) again to attempt to close the Google Photos pop-up or the app itself. The current screen is Google Photos with a \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up. The predicted outcome is that the pop-up will close, or the Google Photos app will close, returning the agent to the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) for the second time was unsuccessful. The \\'Google Photos\\' app and its \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up remain on the screen. The agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal. To proceed, the pop-up or the app needs to be closed to return to the app drawer.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.38\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'[Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'[Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [75, 337, 104, 666], \\'text\\': \\'Google Photos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [141, 33, 162, 207], \\'text\\': \\'TestAgent\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [277, 45, 284, 200], \\'text\\': \\'Keep your memories safe\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [686, 181, 721, 819], \\'text\\': \\'Keep your memories safe\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [737, 110, 777, 894], \\'text\\': \\'Your photos & videos will be securely backed up to Google Photos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [832, 331, 856, 669], \\'text\\': \\'Sign in to back up\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [886, 47, 940, 957], \\'text\\': \\'Your photos videos will back up in Original quality. You can turn off or manage backup at any time in Settings. Google Photos uses face grouping: Learn more\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [820, 33, 866, 970]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [920, 523, 938, 685]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below.

Use Simple Gallery to view the receipt. Please enter transactions in csv format including the header \"Date, Item, Amount\".\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[736,397],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Gallery\\' app icon, which is an orange circle with a white mountain and sun, located in the app drawer. This action is intended to open the Simple Gallery app. The \\'Gallery\\' app icon is currently visible on the screen. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Gallery\\' icon at [736,397] did not open an application or change the screen. The device remains in the app drawer. This action was a failure because the target was to open \\'Simple Gallery\\', but the tapped icon was for an app named \\'Gallery\\', and in any case, no app opened. The agent needs to scroll to find the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app and then tap on it.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the lower part of the screen (y=800, x=500) to the upper part of the screen (y=300, x=500) to scroll down the app drawer. This is done to find the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app, which is not currently visible. The app drawer is currently displayed. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, revealing more applications. This action was successful and brings the agent closer to finding and opening the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app. The next step is to identify and tap on the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app icon, which might be labeled as \\'Photos\\'.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[648,168],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Photos\\' app icon, which is a colorful pinwheel, located in the app drawer. The center of the icon is approximately at [648, 168]. This action is intended to open the Simple Gallery app. The \\'Photos\\' app icon is currently visible on the screen. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Photos\\' icon at [648, 168] resulted in opening the \\'Google Photos\\' application, not \\'Simple Gallery\\'. This is evident from the \\'Google Photos\\' title, the \\'Backup is off\\' message, and the \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up with a \\'Sign in to back up\\' button. This action was a failure as it did not open the intended application and therefore did not progress towards completing the active subgoal. To correct this, Google Photos needs to be closed, and a new search for \\'Simple Gallery\\' in the app drawer must be performed.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button (keycode 4) to close the Google Photos app and the \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up. This action is intended to return to the app drawer, allowing the agent to continue searching for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app. The current screen is Google Photos with a pop-up. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) did not close the Google Photos app or the \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up. The screen remains on Google Photos with the pop-up visible. The action was a failure as it did not return the agent to the app drawer to continue searching for \\'Simple Gallery\\'.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button (keycode 4) again to attempt to close the Google Photos pop-up or the app itself. The current screen is Google Photos with a \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up. The predicted outcome is that the pop-up will close, or the Google Photos app will close, returning the agent to the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) for the second time was unsuccessful. The \\'Google Photos\\' app and its \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up remain on the screen. The agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal. To proceed, the pop-up or the app needs to be closed to return to the app drawer.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 6: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Google Photos\\' title bar area, specifically around coordinates [89, 500], to attempt to dismiss the \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up. The pop-up is currently active, preventing further interaction with the Google Photos app or navigation away from it using the back button.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is done to find the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app, which is not currently visible. The app drawer is currently displayed. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, revealing more applications. This action was successful and brings the agent closer to finding and opening the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app. The next step is to identify and tap on the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app icon, which might be labeled as \\'Photos\\'.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[648,168],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Photos\\' app icon, which is a colorful pinwheel, located in the app drawer. The center of the icon is approximately at [648, 168]. This action is intended to open the Simple Gallery app. The \\'Photos\\' app icon is currently visible on the screen. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Photos\\' icon at [648, 168] resulted in opening the \\'Google Photos\\' application, not \\'Simple Gallery\\'. This is evident from the \\'Google Photos\\' title, the \\'Backup is off\\' message, and the \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up with a \\'Sign in to back up\\' button. This action was a failure as it did not open the intended application and therefore did not progress towards completing the active subgoal. To correct this, Google Photos needs to be closed, and a new search for \\'Simple Gallery\\' in the app drawer must be performed.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button (keycode 4) to close the Google Photos app and the \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up. This action is intended to return to the app drawer, allowing the agent to continue searching for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app. The current screen is Google Photos with a pop-up. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) did not close the Google Photos app or the \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up. The screen remains on Google Photos with the pop-up visible. The action was a failure as it did not return the agent to the app drawer to continue searching for \\'Simple Gallery\\'.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button (keycode 4) again to attempt to close the Google Photos pop-up or the app itself. The current screen is Google Photos with a \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up. The predicted outcome is that the pop-up will close, or the Google Photos app will close, returning the agent to the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) for the second time was unsuccessful. The \\'Google Photos\\' app and its \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up remain on the screen. The agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal. To proceed, the pop-up or the app needs to be closed to return to the app drawer.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Google Photos\\' title bar area, specifically around coordinates [89, 500], to attempt to dismiss the \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up. The pop-up is currently active, preventing further interaction with the Google Photos app or navigation away from it using the back button. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [89, 500] successfully dismissed the \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up within the Google Photos application. The screen now displays the main Google Photos interface, with \\'Photos\\' and \\'Search\\' tabs visible at the bottom. This action was successful as it removed the pop-up, which was an obstacle. The agent is closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to close Google Photos and return to the app drawer to search for \\'Simple Gallery\\'.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.38\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [75, 337, 104, 668], \\'text\\': \\'Google Photos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [141, 33, 162, 207], \\'text\\': \\'TestAgent\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [277, 45, 284, 200], \\'text\\': \\'Keep your memories safe\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [938, 192, 954, 310], \\'text\\': \\'Photos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [938, 690, 955, 810], \\'text\\': \\'Search\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 333, 104, 670]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [887, 394, 1000, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 195, 37, 242]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [895, 168, 965, 331]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [129, 1, 175, 247]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 32, 37, 214]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [175, 1, 221, 246]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 873, 110, 977]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [52, 842, 67, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [13, 820, 39, 892]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [47, 107, 72, 249]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Use Simple Gallery to view the receipt. Please enter transactions in csv format including the header \"Date, Item, Amount\".\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the lower part of the screen (y=800, x=500) to the upper part of the screen (y=300, x=500) to scroll down the app drawer. This is done to find the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app, which is not currently visible. The app drawer is currently displayed. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, revealing more applications. This action was successful and brings the agent closer to finding and opening the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app. The next step is to identify and tap on the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app icon, which might be labeled as \\'Photos\\'.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[648,168],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Photos\\' app icon, which is a colorful pinwheel, located in the app drawer. The center of the icon is approximately at [648, 168]. This action is intended to open the Simple Gallery app. The \\'Photos\\' app icon is currently visible on the screen. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Photos\\' icon at [648, 168] resulted in opening the \\'Google Photos\\' application, not \\'Simple Gallery\\'. This is evident from the \\'Google Photos\\' title, the \\'Backup is off\\' message, and the \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up with a \\'Sign in to back up\\' button. This action was a failure as it did not open the intended application and therefore did not progress towards completing the active subgoal. To correct this, Google Photos needs to be closed, and a new search for \\'Simple Gallery\\' in the app drawer must be performed.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button (keycode 4) to close the Google Photos app and the \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up. This action is intended to return to the app drawer, allowing the agent to continue searching for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app. The current screen is Google Photos with a pop-up. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) did not close the Google Photos app or the \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up. The screen remains on Google Photos with the pop-up visible. The action was a failure as it did not return the agent to the app drawer to continue searching for \\'Simple Gallery\\'.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button (keycode 4) again to attempt to close the Google Photos pop-up or the app itself. The current screen is Google Photos with a \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up. The predicted outcome is that the pop-up will close, or the Google Photos app will close, returning the agent to the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) for the second time was unsuccessful. The \\'Google Photos\\' app and its \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up remain on the screen. The agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal. To proceed, the pop-up or the app needs to be closed to return to the app drawer.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Google Photos\\' title bar area, specifically around coordinates [89, 500], to attempt to dismiss the \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up. The pop-up is currently active, preventing further interaction with the Google Photos app or navigation away from it using the back button. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [89, 500] successfully dismissed the \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up within the Google Photos application. The screen now displays the main Google Photos interface, with \\'Photos\\' and \\'Search\\' tabs visible at the bottom. This action was successful as it removed the pop-up, which was an obstacle. The agent is closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to close Google Photos and return to the app drawer to search for \\'Simple Gallery\\'.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 7: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button (keycode 4) to close the Google Photos app. The current screen is the main interface of Google Photos. The predicted outcome is that Google Photos will close, and the agent will return to the app drawer, allowing the search for \\'Simple Gallery\\' to continue. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Simple Gallery and view receipt.png\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'receipt.png\\' image is displayed full-screen or prominently within the Simple Gallery app.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully opened the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[648,168],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Photos\\' app icon, which is a colorful pinwheel, located in the app drawer. The center of the icon is approximately at [648, 168]. This action is intended to open the Simple Gallery app. The \\'Photos\\' app icon is currently visible on the screen. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Photos\\' icon at [648, 168] resulted in opening the \\'Google Photos\\' application, not \\'Simple Gallery\\'. This is evident from the \\'Google Photos\\' title, the \\'Backup is off\\' message, and the \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up with a \\'Sign in to back up\\' button. This action was a failure as it did not open the intended application and therefore did not progress towards completing the active subgoal. To correct this, Google Photos needs to be closed, and a new search for \\'Simple Gallery\\' in the app drawer must be performed.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button (keycode 4) to close the Google Photos app and the \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up. This action is intended to return to the app drawer, allowing the agent to continue searching for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app. The current screen is Google Photos with a pop-up. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) did not close the Google Photos app or the \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up. The screen remains on Google Photos with the pop-up visible. The action was a failure as it did not return the agent to the app drawer to continue searching for \\'Simple Gallery\\'.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button (keycode 4) again to attempt to close the Google Photos pop-up or the app itself. The current screen is Google Photos with a \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up. The predicted outcome is that the pop-up will close, or the Google Photos app will close, returning the agent to the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) for the second time was unsuccessful. The \\'Google Photos\\' app and its \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up remain on the screen. The agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal. To proceed, the pop-up or the app needs to be closed to return to the app drawer.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Google Photos\\' title bar area, specifically around coordinates [89, 500], to attempt to dismiss the \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up. The pop-up is currently active, preventing further interaction with the Google Photos app or navigation away from it using the back button. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [89, 500] successfully dismissed the \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up within the Google Photos application. The screen now displays the main Google Photos interface, with \\'Photos\\' and \\'Search\\' tabs visible at the bottom. This action was successful as it removed the pop-up, which was an obstacle. The agent is closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to close Google Photos and return to the app drawer to search for \\'Simple Gallery\\'.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button (keycode 4) to close the Google Photos app. The current screen is the main interface of Google Photos. The predicted outcome is that Google Photos will close, and the agent will return to the app drawer, allowing the search for \\'Simple Gallery\\' to continue. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) successfully closed the Google Photos app. The device returned to the app drawer, which is now visible on the screen. This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing it to search for \\'Simple Gallery\\' again.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Use Simple Gallery to view the receipt. Please enter transactions in csv format including the header \"Date, Item, Amount\".\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[648,168],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Photos\\' app icon, which is a colorful pinwheel, located in the app drawer. The center of the icon is approximately at [648, 168]. This action is intended to open the Simple Gallery app. The \\'Photos\\' app icon is currently visible on the screen. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Photos\\' icon at [648, 168] resulted in opening the \\'Google Photos\\' application, not \\'Simple Gallery\\'. This is evident from the \\'Google Photos\\' title, the \\'Backup is off\\' message, and the \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up with a \\'Sign in to back up\\' button. This action was a failure as it did not open the intended application and therefore did not progress towards completing the active subgoal. To correct this, Google Photos needs to be closed, and a new search for \\'Simple Gallery\\' in the app drawer must be performed.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button (keycode 4) to close the Google Photos app and the \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up. This action is intended to return to the app drawer, allowing the agent to continue searching for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app. The current screen is Google Photos with a pop-up. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) did not close the Google Photos app or the \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up. The screen remains on Google Photos with the pop-up visible. The action was a failure as it did not return the agent to the app drawer to continue searching for \\'Simple Gallery\\'.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button (keycode 4) again to attempt to close the Google Photos pop-up or the app itself. The current screen is Google Photos with a \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up. The predicted outcome is that the pop-up will close, or the Google Photos app will close, returning the agent to the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) for the second time was unsuccessful. The \\'Google Photos\\' app and its \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up remain on the screen. The agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal. To proceed, the pop-up or the app needs to be closed to return to the app drawer.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Google Photos\\' title bar area, specifically around coordinates [89, 500], to attempt to dismiss the \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up. The pop-up is currently active, preventing further interaction with the Google Photos app or navigation away from it using the back button. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [89, 500] successfully dismissed the \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up within the Google Photos application. The screen now displays the main Google Photos interface, with \\'Photos\\' and \\'Search\\' tabs visible at the bottom. This action was successful as it removed the pop-up, which was an obstacle. The agent is closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to close Google Photos and return to the app drawer to search for \\'Simple Gallery\\'.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button (keycode 4) to close the Google Photos app. The current screen is the main interface of Google Photos. The predicted outcome is that Google Photos will close, and the agent will return to the app drawer, allowing the search for \\'Simple Gallery\\' to continue. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) successfully closed the Google Photos app. The device returned to the app drawer, which is now visible on the screen. This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing it to search for \\'Simple Gallery\\' again.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 8: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[238,387],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Gallery\\' app icon (orange icon with mountain and sun) located in the app drawer. The center of the icon is approximately at [238, 387]. This action is intended to open the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app. The \\'Gallery\\' app icon is currently visible on the screen.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17.

This action is intended to return to the app drawer, allowing the agent to continue searching for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app. The current screen is Google Photos with a pop-up. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) did not close the Google Photos app or the \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up. The screen remains on Google Photos with the pop-up visible. The action was a failure as it did not return the agent to the app drawer to continue searching for \\'Simple Gallery\\'.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button (keycode 4) again to attempt to close the Google Photos pop-up or the app itself. The current screen is Google Photos with a \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up. The predicted outcome is that the pop-up will close, or the Google Photos app will close, returning the agent to the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) for the second time was unsuccessful. The \\'Google Photos\\' app and its \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up remain on the screen. The agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal. To proceed, the pop-up or the app needs to be closed to return to the app drawer.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Google Photos\\' title bar area, specifically around coordinates [89, 500], to attempt to dismiss the \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up. The pop-up is currently active, preventing further interaction with the Google Photos app or navigation away from it using the back button. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [89, 500] successfully dismissed the \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up within the Google Photos application. The screen now displays the main Google Photos interface, with \\'Photos\\' and \\'Search\\' tabs visible at the bottom. This action was successful as it removed the pop-up, which was an obstacle. The agent is closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to close Google Photos and return to the app drawer to search for \\'Simple Gallery\\'.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button (keycode 4) to close the Google Photos app. The current screen is the main interface of Google Photos. The predicted outcome is that Google Photos will close, and the agent will return to the app drawer, allowing the search for \\'Simple Gallery\\' to continue. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) successfully closed the Google Photos app. The device returned to the app drawer, which is now visible on the screen. This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing it to search for \\'Simple Gallery\\' again.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[238,387],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Gallery\\' app icon (orange icon with mountain and sun) located in the app drawer. The center of the icon is approximately at [238, 387]. This action is intended to open the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app. The \\'Gallery\\' app icon is currently visible on the screen. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Gallery\\' icon at [238, 387] successfully opened an application. The new screen displays a \\'Search folders\\' bar at the top, content that appears to be an image preview (\\'Future Tech LLC...\\'), and a \\'DCIM\\' folder. This app is likely a gallery or file manager. However, it is not confirmed if this is the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app specified in the user instruction. The action was successful in opening an app, but it might be the incorrect app. To proceed, the plan is to return to the app drawer to find the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.39\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [79, 171, 99, 461], \\'text\\': \\'Search folders\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [168, 7, 189, 307], \\'text\\': \\'Future Tech LLC Innovation and Excellence\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [199, 8, 209, 327], \\'text\\': \\'2023-03-23, Monitor Stand, $33.22\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [299, 18, 315, 107], \\'text\\': \\'DCIM\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [330, 11, 344, 247], \\'text\\': \\'you for your purchase! Visit us at: WWW tech-gadgets col\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [274, 0, 349, 500]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 639, 114, 724]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 194, 39, 242]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 753, 114, 840]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 139, 39, 188]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 853, 113, 946]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [13, 819, 40, 895]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 903, 38, 947]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [139, 2, 274, 503]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below.

This action is intended to return to the app drawer, allowing the agent to continue searching for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app. The current screen is Google Photos with a pop-up. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) did not close the Google Photos app or the \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up. The screen remains on Google Photos with the pop-up visible. The action was a failure as it did not return the agent to the app drawer to continue searching for \\'Simple Gallery\\'.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button (keycode 4) again to attempt to close the Google Photos pop-up or the app itself. The current screen is Google Photos with a \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up. The predicted outcome is that the pop-up will close, or the Google Photos app will close, returning the agent to the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) for the second time was unsuccessful. The \\'Google Photos\\' app and its \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up remain on the screen. The agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal. To proceed, the pop-up or the app needs to be closed to return to the app drawer.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Google Photos\\' title bar area, specifically around coordinates [89, 500], to attempt to dismiss the \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up. The pop-up is currently active, preventing further interaction with the Google Photos app or navigation away from it using the back button. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [89, 500] successfully dismissed the \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up within the Google Photos application. The screen now displays the main Google Photos interface, with \\'Photos\\' and \\'Search\\' tabs visible at the bottom. This action was successful as it removed the pop-up, which was an obstacle. The agent is closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to close Google Photos and return to the app drawer to search for \\'Simple Gallery\\'.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button (keycode 4) to close the Google Photos app. The current screen is the main interface of Google Photos. The predicted outcome is that Google Photos will close, and the agent will return to the app drawer, allowing the search for \\'Simple Gallery\\' to continue. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) successfully closed the Google Photos app. The device returned to the app drawer, which is now visible on the screen. This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing it to search for \\'Simple Gallery\\' again.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[238,387],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Gallery\\' app icon (orange icon with mountain and sun) located in the app drawer. The center of the icon is approximately at [238, 387]. This action is intended to open the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app. The \\'Gallery\\' app icon is currently visible on the screen. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Gallery\\' icon at [238, 387] successfully opened an application. The new screen displays a \\'Search folders\\' bar at the top, content that appears to be an image preview (\\'Future Tech LLC...\\'), and a \\'DCIM\\' folder. This app is likely a gallery or file manager. However, it is not confirmed if this is the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app specified in the user instruction. The action was successful in opening an app, but it might be the incorrect app. To proceed, the plan is to return to the app drawer to find the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 9: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button (keycode 4) to close the currently open gallery app. The current screen shows a gallery app with a \\'Search folders\\' bar. The predicted outcome is that this app will close, and the agent will return to the app drawer, allowing the search for \\'Simple Gallery\\' to continue.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The current screen is Google Photos with a \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up. The predicted outcome is that the pop-up will close, or the Google Photos app will close, returning the agent to the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) for the second time was unsuccessful. The \\'Google Photos\\' app and its \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up remain on the screen. The agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal. To proceed, the pop-up or the app needs to be closed to return to the app drawer.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

The pop-up is currently active, preventing further interaction with the Google Photos app or navigation away from it using the back button. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [89, 500] successfully dismissed the \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up within the Google Photos application. The screen now displays the main Google Photos interface, with \\'Photos\\' and \\'Search\\' tabs visible at the bottom. This action was successful as it removed the pop-up, which was an obstacle. The agent is closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to close Google Photos and return to the app drawer to search for \\'Simple Gallery\\'.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button (keycode 4) to close the Google Photos app. The current screen is the main interface of Google Photos. The predicted outcome is that Google Photos will close, and the agent will return to the app drawer, allowing the search for \\'Simple Gallery\\' to continue. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) successfully closed the Google Photos app. The device returned to the app drawer, which is now visible on the screen. This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing it to search for \\'Simple Gallery\\' again.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[238,387],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Gallery\\' app icon (orange icon with mountain and sun) located in the app drawer. The center of the icon is approximately at [238, 387]. This action is intended to open the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app. The \\'Gallery\\' app icon is currently visible on the screen. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Gallery\\' icon at [238, 387] successfully opened an application. The new screen displays a \\'Search folders\\' bar at the top, content that appears to be an image preview (\\'Future Tech LLC...\\'), and a \\'DCIM\\' folder. This app is likely a gallery or file manager. However, it is not confirmed if this is the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app specified in the user instruction. The action was successful in opening an app, but it might be the incorrect app. To proceed, the plan is to return to the app drawer to find the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button (keycode 4) to close the currently open gallery app. The current screen shows a gallery app with a \\'Search folders\\' bar. The predicted outcome is that this app will close, and the agent will return to the app drawer, allowing the search for \\'Simple Gallery\\' to continue. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) successfully closed the gallery-like app that was previously opened. The screen now displays the app drawer, which is the desired outcome. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as it can now search for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app in the app drawer.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The current screen is Google Photos with a \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up. The predicted outcome is that the pop-up will close, or the Google Photos app will close, returning the agent to the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) for the second time was unsuccessful. The \\'Google Photos\\' app and its \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up remain on the screen. The agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal. To proceed, the pop-up or the app needs to be closed to return to the app drawer.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Google Photos\\' title bar area, specifically around coordinates [89, 500], to attempt to dismiss the \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up. The pop-up is currently active, preventing further interaction with the Google Photos app or navigation away from it using the back button. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [89, 500] successfully dismissed the \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up within the Google Photos application. The screen now displays the main Google Photos interface, with \\'Photos\\' and \\'Search\\' tabs visible at the bottom. This action was successful as it removed the pop-up, which was an obstacle. The agent is closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to close Google Photos and return to the app drawer to search for \\'Simple Gallery\\'.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button (keycode 4) to close the Google Photos app. The current screen is the main interface of Google Photos. The predicted outcome is that Google Photos will close, and the agent will return to the app drawer, allowing the search for \\'Simple Gallery\\' to continue. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) successfully closed the Google Photos app. The device returned to the app drawer, which is now visible on the screen. This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing it to search for \\'Simple Gallery\\' again.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[238,387],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Gallery\\' app icon (orange icon with mountain and sun) located in the app drawer. The center of the icon is approximately at [238, 387]. This action is intended to open the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app. The \\'Gallery\\' app icon is currently visible on the screen. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Gallery\\' icon at [238, 387] successfully opened an application. The new screen displays a \\'Search folders\\' bar at the top, content that appears to be an image preview (\\'Future Tech LLC...\\'), and a \\'DCIM\\' folder. This app is likely a gallery or file manager. However, it is not confirmed if this is the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app specified in the user instruction. The action was successful in opening an app, but it might be the incorrect app. To proceed, the plan is to return to the app drawer to find the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button (keycode 4) to close the currently open gallery app. The current screen shows a gallery app with a \\'Search folders\\' bar. The predicted outcome is that this app will close, and the agent will return to the app drawer, allowing the search for \\'Simple Gallery\\' to continue. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) successfully closed the gallery-like app that was previously opened. The screen now displays the app drawer, which is the desired outcome. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as it can now search for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app in the app drawer.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 10: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [800, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down in the app drawer. The current screen shows the app drawer, but \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not visible. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will scroll, revealing more apps, and hopefully \\'Simple Gallery\\' will become visible. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Simple Gallery and view receipt.png\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'receipt.png\\' image is displayed full-screen or prominently within the Simple Gallery app.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully opened the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Google Photos\\' title bar area, specifically around coordinates [89, 500], to attempt to dismiss the \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up. The pop-up is currently active, preventing further interaction with the Google Photos app or navigation away from it using the back button. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [89, 500] successfully dismissed the \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up within the Google Photos application. The screen now displays the main Google Photos interface, with \\'Photos\\' and \\'Search\\' tabs visible at the bottom. This action was successful as it removed the pop-up, which was an obstacle. The agent is closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to close Google Photos and return to the app drawer to search for \\'Simple Gallery\\'.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button (keycode 4) to close the Google Photos app. The current screen is the main interface of Google Photos. The predicted outcome is that Google Photos will close, and the agent will return to the app drawer, allowing the search for \\'Simple Gallery\\' to continue. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) successfully closed the Google Photos app. The device returned to the app drawer, which is now visible on the screen. This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing it to search for \\'Simple Gallery\\' again.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[238,387],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Gallery\\' app icon (orange icon with mountain and sun) located in the app drawer. The center of the icon is approximately at [238, 387]. This action is intended to open the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app. The \\'Gallery\\' app icon is currently visible on the screen. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Gallery\\' icon at [238, 387] successfully opened an application. The new screen displays a \\'Search folders\\' bar at the top, content that appears to be an image preview (\\'Future Tech LLC...\\'), and a \\'DCIM\\' folder. This app is likely a gallery or file manager. However, it is not confirmed if this is the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app specified in the user instruction. The action was successful in opening an app, but it might be the incorrect app. To proceed, the plan is to return to the app drawer to find the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button (keycode 4) to close the currently open gallery app. The current screen shows a gallery app with a \\'Search folders\\' bar. The predicted outcome is that this app will close, and the agent will return to the app drawer, allowing the search for \\'Simple Gallery\\' to continue. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) successfully closed the gallery-like app that was previously opened. The screen now displays the app drawer, which is the desired outcome. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as it can now search for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app in the app drawer.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [800, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down in the app drawer. The current screen shows the app drawer, but \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not visible. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will scroll, revealing more apps, and hopefully \\'Simple Gallery\\' will become visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [800, 500] to [300, 500] was performed. However, the content of the app drawer displayed on the screen did not change. No new apps were revealed. This means the swipe either did not effectively scroll the view or there is no more content to scroll to. The agent is not closer to finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' if it\\'s not on the current screen, as the view remains the same.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below.

Use Simple Gallery to view the receipt. Please enter transactions in csv format including the header \"Date, Item, Amount\".\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Google Photos\\' title bar area, specifically around coordinates [89, 500], to attempt to dismiss the \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up. The pop-up is currently active, preventing further interaction with the Google Photos app or navigation away from it using the back button. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [89, 500] successfully dismissed the \\'Keep your memories safe\\' pop-up within the Google Photos application. The screen now displays the main Google Photos interface, with \\'Photos\\' and \\'Search\\' tabs visible at the bottom. This action was successful as it removed the pop-up, which was an obstacle. The agent is closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to close Google Photos and return to the app drawer to search for \\'Simple Gallery\\'.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button (keycode 4) to close the Google Photos app. The current screen is the main interface of Google Photos. The predicted outcome is that Google Photos will close, and the agent will return to the app drawer, allowing the search for \\'Simple Gallery\\' to continue. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) successfully closed the Google Photos app. The device returned to the app drawer, which is now visible on the screen. This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing it to search for \\'Simple Gallery\\' again.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[238,387],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Gallery\\' app icon (orange icon with mountain and sun) located in the app drawer. The center of the icon is approximately at [238, 387]. This action is intended to open the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app. The \\'Gallery\\' app icon is currently visible on the screen. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Gallery\\' icon at [238, 387] successfully opened an application. The new screen displays a \\'Search folders\\' bar at the top, content that appears to be an image preview (\\'Future Tech LLC...\\'), and a \\'DCIM\\' folder. This app is likely a gallery or file manager. However, it is not confirmed if this is the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app specified in the user instruction. The action was successful in opening an app, but it might be the incorrect app. To proceed, the plan is to return to the app drawer to find the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button (keycode 4) to close the currently open gallery app. The current screen shows a gallery app with a \\'Search folders\\' bar. The predicted outcome is that this app will close, and the agent will return to the app drawer, allowing the search for \\'Simple Gallery\\' to continue. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) successfully closed the gallery-like app that was previously opened. The screen now displays the app drawer, which is the desired outcome. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as it can now search for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app in the app drawer.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [800, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down in the app drawer. The current screen shows the app drawer, but \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not visible. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will scroll, revealing more apps, and hopefully \\'Simple Gallery\\' will become visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [800, 500] to [300, 500] was performed. However, the content of the app drawer displayed on the screen did not change. No new apps were revealed. This means the swipe either did not effectively scroll the view or there is no more content to scroll to. The agent is not closer to finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' if it\\'s not on the current screen, as the view remains the same.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 11: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [900, 500] to [100, 500] to scroll down in the app drawer. The current screen shows the app drawer, but \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not visible. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will scroll, revealing more apps, and hopefully \\'Simple Gallery\\' will become visible. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Simple Gallery and view receipt.png\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'receipt.png\\' image is displayed full-screen or prominently within the Simple Gallery app.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully opened the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button (keycode 4) to close the Google Photos app. The current screen is the main interface of Google Photos. The predicted outcome is that Google Photos will close, and the agent will return to the app drawer, allowing the search for \\'Simple Gallery\\' to continue. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) successfully closed the Google Photos app. The device returned to the app drawer, which is now visible on the screen. This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing it to search for \\'Simple Gallery\\' again.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[238,387],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Gallery\\' app icon (orange icon with mountain and sun) located in the app drawer. The center of the icon is approximately at [238, 387]. This action is intended to open the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app. The \\'Gallery\\' app icon is currently visible on the screen. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Gallery\\' icon at [238, 387] successfully opened an application. The new screen displays a \\'Search folders\\' bar at the top, content that appears to be an image preview (\\'Future Tech LLC...\\'), and a \\'DCIM\\' folder. This app is likely a gallery or file manager. However, it is not confirmed if this is the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app specified in the user instruction. The action was successful in opening an app, but it might be the incorrect app. To proceed, the plan is to return to the app drawer to find the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button (keycode 4) to close the currently open gallery app. The current screen shows a gallery app with a \\'Search folders\\' bar. The predicted outcome is that this app will close, and the agent will return to the app drawer, allowing the search for \\'Simple Gallery\\' to continue. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) successfully closed the gallery-like app that was previously opened. The screen now displays the app drawer, which is the desired outcome. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as it can now search for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app in the app drawer.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [800, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down in the app drawer. The current screen shows the app drawer, but \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not visible. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will scroll, revealing more apps, and hopefully \\'Simple Gallery\\' will become visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [800, 500] to [300, 500] was performed. However, the content of the app drawer displayed on the screen did not change. No new apps were revealed. This means the swipe either did not effectively scroll the view or there is no more content to scroll to. The agent is not closer to finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' if it\\'s not on the current screen, as the view remains the same.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [900, 500] to [100, 500] to scroll down in the app drawer. The current screen shows the app drawer, but \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not visible. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will scroll, revealing more apps, and hopefully \\'Simple Gallery\\' will become visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900, 500] to [100, 500] was executed. However, the app drawer\\'s content did not change, meaning the list of apps did not scroll. No new apps were revealed. This action did not bring the agent closer to finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' because the view of the app drawer remained the same. The failure of this scroll attempt (the second one) necessitates a change in strategy to locate the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The new screen displays a \\'Search folders\\' bar at the top, content that appears to be an image preview (\\'Future Tech LLC...\\'), and a \\'DCIM\\' folder. This app is likely a gallery or file manager. However, it is not confirmed if this is the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app specified in the user instruction.

Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [800, 500] to [300, 500] was performed. However, the content of the app drawer displayed on the screen did not change. No new apps were revealed. This means the swipe either did not effectively scroll the view or there is no more content to scroll to.

The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will scroll, revealing more apps, and hopefully \\'Simple Gallery\\' will become visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900, 500] to [100, 500] was executed. However, the app drawer\\'s content did not change, meaning the list of apps did not scroll. No new apps were revealed.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Use Simple Gallery to view the receipt. Please enter transactions in csv format including the header \"Date, Item, Amount\".\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[238,387],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Gallery\\' app icon (orange icon with mountain and sun) located in the app drawer. The center of the icon is approximately at [238, 387]. This action is intended to open the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app. The \\'Gallery\\' app icon is currently visible on the screen. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Gallery\\' icon at [238, 387] successfully opened an application. The new screen displays a \\'Search folders\\' bar at the top, content that appears to be an image preview (\\'Future Tech LLC...\\'), and a \\'DCIM\\' folder. This app is likely a gallery or file manager. However, it is not confirmed if this is the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app specified in the user instruction. The action was successful in opening an app, but it might be the incorrect app. To proceed, the plan is to return to the app drawer to find the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button (keycode 4) to close the currently open gallery app. The current screen shows a gallery app with a \\'Search folders\\' bar. The predicted outcome is that this app will close, and the agent will return to the app drawer, allowing the search for \\'Simple Gallery\\' to continue. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) successfully closed the gallery-like app that was previously opened. The screen now displays the app drawer, which is the desired outcome. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as it can now search for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app in the app drawer.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [800, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down in the app drawer. The current screen shows the app drawer, but \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not visible. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will scroll, revealing more apps, and hopefully \\'Simple Gallery\\' will become visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [800, 500] to [300, 500] was performed. However, the content of the app drawer displayed on the screen did not change. No new apps were revealed. This means the swipe either did not effectively scroll the view or there is no more content to scroll to. The agent is not closer to finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' if it\\'s not on the current screen, as the view remains the same.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [900, 500] to [100, 500] to scroll down in the app drawer. The current screen shows the app drawer, but \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not visible. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will scroll, revealing more apps, and hopefully \\'Simple Gallery\\' will become visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900, 500] to [100, 500] was executed. However, the app drawer\\'s content did not change, meaning the list of apps did not scroll. No new apps were revealed. This action did not bring the agent closer to finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' because the view of the app drawer remained the same. The failure of this scroll attempt (the second one) necessitates a change in strategy to locate the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[300,500],\"end_point\":[700,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down on the screen from [300, 500] to [700, 500]. The current screen is the app drawer. The predicted outcome is that a search bar will appear at the top of the app drawer, allowing the agent to search for \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [300, 500] to [700, 500] (swipe down) resulted in the app drawer scrolling upwards, displaying a different set of apps. The apps \\'YouTube\\', \\'Settings\\', \\'Photos\\', \\'Clock\\' are now visible at the top. No search bar appeared. This action did not bring the agent closer to finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' as it did not reveal a search bar and scrolled in an unexpected direction. The agent needs to try scrolling down (swiping up) to find \\'Simple Gallery\\'.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 13: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [700, 500] to [300, 500]. The current screen shows the app drawer, scrolled to the top. This action is intended to scroll the app drawer down, revealing more apps. The predicted outcome is that the list of apps will scroll, and \\'Simple Gallery\\' might become visible. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Simple Gallery and view receipt.png\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'receipt.png\\' image is displayed full-screen or prominently within the Simple Gallery app.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully opened the app drawer.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The predicted outcome is that this app will close, and the agent will return to the app drawer, allowing the search for \\'Simple Gallery\\' to continue. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) successfully closed the gallery-like app that was previously opened. The screen now displays the app drawer, which is the desired outcome. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as it can now search for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app in the app drawer.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [800, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down in the app drawer. The current screen shows the app drawer, but \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not visible. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will scroll, revealing more apps, and hopefully \\'Simple Gallery\\' will become visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [800, 500] to [300, 500] was performed. However, the content of the app drawer displayed on the screen did not change. No new apps were revealed. This means the swipe either did not effectively scroll the view or there is no more content to scroll to. The agent is not closer to finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' if it\\'s not on the current screen, as the view remains the same.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [900, 500] to [100, 500] to scroll down in the app drawer. The current screen shows the app drawer, but \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not visible. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will scroll, revealing more apps, and hopefully \\'Simple Gallery\\' will become visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900, 500] to [100, 500] was executed. However, the app drawer\\'s content did not change, meaning the list of apps did not scroll. No new apps were revealed. This action did not bring the agent closer to finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' because the view of the app drawer remained the same. The failure of this scroll attempt (the second one) necessitates a change in strategy to locate the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[300,500],\"end_point\":[700,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down on the screen from [300, 500] to [700, 500]. The current screen is the app drawer. The predicted outcome is that a search bar will appear at the top of the app drawer, allowing the agent to search for \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [300, 500] to [700, 500] (swipe down) resulted in the app drawer scrolling upwards, displaying a different set of apps. The apps \\'YouTube\\', \\'Settings\\', \\'Photos\\', \\'Clock\\' are now visible at the top. No search bar appeared. This action did not bring the agent closer to finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' as it did not reveal a search bar and scrolled in an unexpected direction. The agent needs to try scrolling down (swiping up) to find \\'Simple Gallery\\'.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [700, 500] to [300, 500]. The current screen shows the app drawer, scrolled to the top. This action is intended to scroll the app drawer down, revealing more apps. The predicted outcome is that the list of apps will scroll, and \\'Simple Gallery\\' might become visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] successfully scrolled the app drawer downwards. New applications are now visible on the screen. \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not yet visible among the currently displayed apps. This action brought the agent closer to potentially finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' by revealing more apps, but the target app has not been located yet. Further scrolling is required.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance.

To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Use Simple Gallery to view the receipt. Please enter transactions in csv format including the header \"Date, Item, Amount\".\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button (keycode 4) to close the currently open gallery app. The current screen shows a gallery app with a \\'Search folders\\' bar. The predicted outcome is that this app will close, and the agent will return to the app drawer, allowing the search for \\'Simple Gallery\\' to continue. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) successfully closed the gallery-like app that was previously opened. The screen now displays the app drawer, which is the desired outcome. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as it can now search for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app in the app drawer.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [800, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down in the app drawer. The current screen shows the app drawer, but \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not visible. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will scroll, revealing more apps, and hopefully \\'Simple Gallery\\' will become visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [800, 500] to [300, 500] was performed. However, the content of the app drawer displayed on the screen did not change. No new apps were revealed. This means the swipe either did not effectively scroll the view or there is no more content to scroll to. The agent is not closer to finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' if it\\'s not on the current screen, as the view remains the same.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [900, 500] to [100, 500] to scroll down in the app drawer. The current screen shows the app drawer, but \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not visible. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will scroll, revealing more apps, and hopefully \\'Simple Gallery\\' will become visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900, 500] to [100, 500] was executed. However, the app drawer\\'s content did not change, meaning the list of apps did not scroll. No new apps were revealed. This action did not bring the agent closer to finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' because the view of the app drawer remained the same. The failure of this scroll attempt (the second one) necessitates a change in strategy to locate the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[300,500],\"end_point\":[700,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down on the screen from [300, 500] to [700, 500]. The current screen is the app drawer. The predicted outcome is that a search bar will appear at the top of the app drawer, allowing the agent to search for \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [300, 500] to [700, 500] (swipe down) resulted in the app drawer scrolling upwards, displaying a different set of apps. The apps \\'YouTube\\', \\'Settings\\', \\'Photos\\', \\'Clock\\' are now visible at the top. No search bar appeared. This action did not bring the agent closer to finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' as it did not reveal a search bar and scrolled in an unexpected direction. The agent needs to try scrolling down (swiping up) to find \\'Simple Gallery\\'.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [700, 500] to [300, 500]. The current screen shows the app drawer, scrolled to the top. This action is intended to scroll the app drawer down, revealing more apps. The predicted outcome is that the list of apps will scroll, and \\'Simple Gallery\\' might become visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] successfully scrolled the app drawer downwards. New applications are now visible on the screen. \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not yet visible among the currently displayed apps. This action brought the agent closer to potentially finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' by revealing more apps, but the target app has not been located yet. Further scrolling is required.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 14: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down in the app drawer. The current screen shows the app drawer, but \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not visible. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will scroll, revealing more apps, and hopefully \\'Simple Gallery\\' will become visible. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Simple Gallery and view receipt.png\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'receipt.png\\' image is displayed full-screen or prominently within the Simple Gallery app.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully opened the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The current screen shows the app drawer, but \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not visible. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will scroll, revealing more apps, and hopefully \\'Simple Gallery\\' will become visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [800, 500] to [300, 500] was performed. However, the content of the app drawer displayed on the screen did not change. No new apps were revealed. This means the swipe either did not effectively scroll the view or there is no more content to scroll to. The agent is not closer to finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' if it\\'s not on the current screen, as the view remains the same.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [900, 500] to [100, 500] to scroll down in the app drawer. The current screen shows the app drawer, but \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not visible. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will scroll, revealing more apps, and hopefully \\'Simple Gallery\\' will become visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900, 500] to [100, 500] was executed. However, the app drawer\\'s content did not change, meaning the list of apps did not scroll. No new apps were revealed. This action did not bring the agent closer to finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' because the view of the app drawer remained the same. The failure of this scroll attempt (the second one) necessitates a change in strategy to locate the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[300,500],\"end_point\":[700,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down on the screen from [300, 500] to [700, 500]. The current screen is the app drawer. The predicted outcome is that a search bar will appear at the top of the app drawer, allowing the agent to search for \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [300, 500] to [700, 500] (swipe down) resulted in the app drawer scrolling upwards, displaying a different set of apps. The apps \\'YouTube\\', \\'Settings\\', \\'Photos\\', \\'Clock\\' are now visible at the top. No search bar appeared. This action did not bring the agent closer to finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' as it did not reveal a search bar and scrolled in an unexpected direction. The agent needs to try scrolling down (swiping up) to find \\'Simple Gallery\\'.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [700, 500] to [300, 500]. The current screen shows the app drawer, scrolled to the top. This action is intended to scroll the app drawer down, revealing more apps. The predicted outcome is that the list of apps will scroll, and \\'Simple Gallery\\' might become visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] successfully scrolled the app drawer downwards. New applications are now visible on the screen. \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not yet visible among the currently displayed apps. This action brought the agent closer to potentially finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' by revealing more apps, but the target app has not been located yet. Further scrolling is required.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down in the app drawer. The current screen shows the app drawer, but \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not visible. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will scroll, revealing more apps, and hopefully \\'Simple Gallery\\' will become visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] was performed. The screen content remained unchanged. No new apps were revealed in the app drawer. This indicates that either the swipe was ineffective, or there is no more content to scroll to in that direction. The agent is not closer to finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' through scrolling, as the view remains the same and the app is not visible.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Use Simple Gallery to view the receipt. Please enter transactions in csv format including the header \"Date, Item, Amount\".\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [800, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down in the app drawer. The current screen shows the app drawer, but \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not visible. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will scroll, revealing more apps, and hopefully \\'Simple Gallery\\' will become visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [800, 500] to [300, 500] was performed. However, the content of the app drawer displayed on the screen did not change. No new apps were revealed. This means the swipe either did not effectively scroll the view or there is no more content to scroll to. The agent is not closer to finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' if it\\'s not on the current screen, as the view remains the same.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [900, 500] to [100, 500] to scroll down in the app drawer. The current screen shows the app drawer, but \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not visible. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will scroll, revealing more apps, and hopefully \\'Simple Gallery\\' will become visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900, 500] to [100, 500] was executed. However, the app drawer\\'s content did not change, meaning the list of apps did not scroll. No new apps were revealed. This action did not bring the agent closer to finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' because the view of the app drawer remained the same. The failure of this scroll attempt (the second one) necessitates a change in strategy to locate the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[300,500],\"end_point\":[700,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down on the screen from [300, 500] to [700, 500]. The current screen is the app drawer. The predicted outcome is that a search bar will appear at the top of the app drawer, allowing the agent to search for \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [300, 500] to [700, 500] (swipe down) resulted in the app drawer scrolling upwards, displaying a different set of apps. The apps \\'YouTube\\', \\'Settings\\', \\'Photos\\', \\'Clock\\' are now visible at the top. No search bar appeared. This action did not bring the agent closer to finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' as it did not reveal a search bar and scrolled in an unexpected direction. The agent needs to try scrolling down (swiping up) to find \\'Simple Gallery\\'.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [700, 500] to [300, 500]. The current screen shows the app drawer, scrolled to the top. This action is intended to scroll the app drawer down, revealing more apps. The predicted outcome is that the list of apps will scroll, and \\'Simple Gallery\\' might become visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] successfully scrolled the app drawer downwards. New applications are now visible on the screen. \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not yet visible among the currently displayed apps. This action brought the agent closer to potentially finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' by revealing more apps, but the target app has not been located yet. Further scrolling is required.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down in the app drawer. The current screen shows the app drawer, but \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not visible. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will scroll, revealing more apps, and hopefully \\'Simple Gallery\\' will become visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] was performed. The screen content remained unchanged. No new apps were revealed in the app drawer. This indicates that either the swipe was ineffective, or there is no more content to scroll to in that direction. The agent is not closer to finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' through scrolling, as the view remains the same and the app is not visible.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 15: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[96,386],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search bar at the top of the app drawer, located at approximately [96, 386]. The search bar is currently inactive. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will become active, and the virtual keyboard will appear, allowing the agent to type the name of the app to search for (\\'Simple Gallery\\'). The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Simple Gallery and view receipt.png\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'receipt.png\\' image is displayed full-screen or prominently within the Simple Gallery app.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully opened the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution.

The current screen shows the app drawer, but \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not visible. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will scroll, revealing more apps, and hopefully \\'Simple Gallery\\' will become visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900, 500] to [100, 500] was executed. However, the app drawer\\'s content did not change, meaning the list of apps did not scroll. No new apps were revealed. This action did not bring the agent closer to finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' because the view of the app drawer remained the same. The failure of this scroll attempt (the second one) necessitates a change in strategy to locate the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[300,500],\"end_point\":[700,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down on the screen from [300, 500] to [700, 500]. The current screen is the app drawer. The predicted outcome is that a search bar will appear at the top of the app drawer, allowing the agent to search for \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [300, 500] to [700, 500] (swipe down) resulted in the app drawer scrolling upwards, displaying a different set of apps. The apps \\'YouTube\\', \\'Settings\\', \\'Photos\\', \\'Clock\\' are now visible at the top. No search bar appeared. This action did not bring the agent closer to finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' as it did not reveal a search bar and scrolled in an unexpected direction. The agent needs to try scrolling down (swiping up) to find \\'Simple Gallery\\'.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [700, 500] to [300, 500]. The current screen shows the app drawer, scrolled to the top. This action is intended to scroll the app drawer down, revealing more apps. The predicted outcome is that the list of apps will scroll, and \\'Simple Gallery\\' might become visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] successfully scrolled the app drawer downwards. New applications are now visible on the screen. \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not yet visible among the currently displayed apps. This action brought the agent closer to potentially finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' by revealing more apps, but the target app has not been located yet. Further scrolling is required.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down in the app drawer. The current screen shows the app drawer, but \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not visible. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will scroll, revealing more apps, and hopefully \\'Simple Gallery\\' will become visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] was performed. The screen content remained unchanged. No new apps were revealed in the app drawer. This indicates that either the swipe was ineffective, or there is no more content to scroll to in that direction. The agent is not closer to finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' through scrolling, as the view remains the same and the app is not visible.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[96,386],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search bar at the top of the app drawer, located at approximately [96, 386]. The search bar is currently inactive. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will become active, and the virtual keyboard will appear, allowing the agent to type the name of the app to search for (\\'Simple Gallery\\'). Actual Outcome: The tap action on the search bar at [96, 386] successfully activated the search bar. The placeholder text \"Search apps, web and more\" is now present in the search field, and the virtual keyboard has appeared on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling the search functionality for apps.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.46\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [84, 193, 113, 805], \\'text\\': \\'Search apps; web and more\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [228, 94, 244, 236], \\'text\\': \\'YouTube\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [228, 321, 247, 457], \\'text\\': \\'Settings\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [229, 557, 244, 671], \\'text\\': \\'Photos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [228, 790, 245, 882], \\'text\\': \\'Clock\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [149, 301, 252, 475]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [148, 529, 253, 697]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [149, 748, 253, 918]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [147, 80, 255, 253]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [81, 856, 113, 911]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"2\", text=\"Search apps, web and more\", resource-id=\"com.google.android.apps.nexuslauncher:id/input\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"com.google.android.apps.nexuslauncher\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[214,156][886,301]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"Search apps, web and more\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right.

Use Simple Gallery to view the receipt.

The current screen shows the app drawer, but \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not visible. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will scroll, revealing more apps, and hopefully \\'Simple Gallery\\' will become visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900, 500] to [100, 500] was executed. However, the app drawer\\'s content did not change, meaning the list of apps did not scroll. No new apps were revealed. This action did not bring the agent closer to finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' because the view of the app drawer remained the same. The failure of this scroll attempt (the second one) necessitates a change in strategy to locate the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[300,500],\"end_point\":[700,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down on the screen from [300, 500] to [700, 500]. The current screen is the app drawer. The predicted outcome is that a search bar will appear at the top of the app drawer, allowing the agent to search for \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [300, 500] to [700, 500] (swipe down) resulted in the app drawer scrolling upwards, displaying a different set of apps. The apps \\'YouTube\\', \\'Settings\\', \\'Photos\\', \\'Clock\\' are now visible at the top. No search bar appeared. This action did not bring the agent closer to finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' as it did not reveal a search bar and scrolled in an unexpected direction. The agent needs to try scrolling down (swiping up) to find \\'Simple Gallery\\'.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [700, 500] to [300, 500]. The current screen shows the app drawer, scrolled to the top. This action is intended to scroll the app drawer down, revealing more apps. The predicted outcome is that the list of apps will scroll, and \\'Simple Gallery\\' might become visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] successfully scrolled the app drawer downwards. New applications are now visible on the screen. \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not yet visible among the currently displayed apps. This action brought the agent closer to potentially finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' by revealing more apps, but the target app has not been located yet. Further scrolling is required.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down in the app drawer. The current screen shows the app drawer, but \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not visible. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will scroll, revealing more apps, and hopefully \\'Simple Gallery\\' will become visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] was performed. The screen content remained unchanged. No new apps were revealed in the app drawer. This indicates that either the swipe was ineffective, or there is no more content to scroll to in that direction. The agent is not closer to finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' through scrolling, as the view remains the same and the app is not visible.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[96,386],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search bar at the top of the app drawer, located at approximately [96, 386]. The search bar is currently inactive. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will become active, and the virtual keyboard will appear, allowing the agent to type the name of the app to search for (\\'Simple Gallery\\'). Actual Outcome: The tap action on the search bar at [96, 386] successfully activated the search bar. The placeholder text \"Search apps, web and more\" is now present in the search field, and the virtual keyboard has appeared on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling the search functionality for apps.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 16: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Simple Gallery\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Simple Gallery\\\\n\\' into the focused search bar. The search bar currently contains \"Search apps, web and more\". The predicted outcome is that \\'Simple Gallery\\' will be typed into the search bar, and the search will be initiated, displaying search results for \\'Simple Gallery\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Simple Gallery and view receipt.png\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'receipt.png\\' image is displayed full-screen or prominently within the Simple Gallery app.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully opened the app drawer.

A swipe up action (from [700, 500] to [300, 500]) successfully scrolled the app drawer down once, revealing more apps. However, a subsequent identical swipe action (Step 14) did not change the screen, suggesting the end of the app list might have been reached or the swipe was ineffective. \\'Simple Gallery\\' is still not visible after multiple scroll attempts.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar.

The current screen is the app drawer. The predicted outcome is that a search bar will appear at the top of the app drawer, allowing the agent to search for \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [300, 500] to [700, 500] (swipe down) resulted in the app drawer scrolling upwards, displaying a different set of apps. The apps \\'YouTube\\', \\'Settings\\', \\'Photos\\', \\'Clock\\' are now visible at the top. No search bar appeared. This action did not bring the agent closer to finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' as it did not reveal a search bar and scrolled in an unexpected direction. The agent needs to try scrolling down (swiping up) to find \\'Simple Gallery\\'.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [700, 500] to [300, 500]. The current screen shows the app drawer, scrolled to the top. This action is intended to scroll the app drawer down, revealing more apps. The predicted outcome is that the list of apps will scroll, and \\'Simple Gallery\\' might become visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] successfully scrolled the app drawer downwards. New applications are now visible on the screen. \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not yet visible among the currently displayed apps. This action brought the agent closer to potentially finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' by revealing more apps, but the target app has not been located yet. Further scrolling is required.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down in the app drawer. The current screen shows the app drawer, but \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not visible. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will scroll, revealing more apps, and hopefully \\'Simple Gallery\\' will become visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] was performed. The screen content remained unchanged. No new apps were revealed in the app drawer. This indicates that either the swipe was ineffective, or there is no more content to scroll to in that direction. The agent is not closer to finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' through scrolling, as the view remains the same and the app is not visible.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[96,386],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search bar at the top of the app drawer, located at approximately [96, 386]. The search bar is currently inactive. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will become active, and the virtual keyboard will appear, allowing the agent to type the name of the app to search for (\\'Simple Gallery\\'). Actual Outcome: The tap action on the search bar at [96, 386] successfully activated the search bar. The placeholder text \"Search apps, web and more\" is now present in the search field, and the virtual keyboard has appeared on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling the search functionality for apps.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Simple Gallery\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Simple Gallery\\\\n\\' into the focused search bar. The search bar currently contains \"Search apps, web and more\". The predicted outcome is that \\'Simple Gallery\\' will be typed into the search bar, and the search will be initiated, displaying search results for \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Simple Gallery\\\\n\\' into the search bar was successful. The text was entered, the search was initiated, and a list of search results is now visible on the screen. The results include \\'Simple Gallery0\\', \\'Simple Gallery1\\', \\'Simple Gallery2\\', and so on. \\'Simple Gallery2\\' is highlighted. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully searching for the required app.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right.

The current screen is the app drawer. The predicted outcome is that a search bar will appear at the top of the app drawer, allowing the agent to search for \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [300, 500] to [700, 500] (swipe down) resulted in the app drawer scrolling upwards, displaying a different set of apps. The apps \\'YouTube\\', \\'Settings\\', \\'Photos\\', \\'Clock\\' are now visible at the top. No search bar appeared. This action did not bring the agent closer to finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' as it did not reveal a search bar and scrolled in an unexpected direction. The agent needs to try scrolling down (swiping up) to find \\'Simple Gallery\\'.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [700, 500] to [300, 500]. The current screen shows the app drawer, scrolled to the top. This action is intended to scroll the app drawer down, revealing more apps. The predicted outcome is that the list of apps will scroll, and \\'Simple Gallery\\' might become visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] successfully scrolled the app drawer downwards. New applications are now visible on the screen. \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not yet visible among the currently displayed apps. This action brought the agent closer to potentially finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' by revealing more apps, but the target app has not been located yet. Further scrolling is required.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down in the app drawer. The current screen shows the app drawer, but \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not visible. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will scroll, revealing more apps, and hopefully \\'Simple Gallery\\' will become visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] was performed. The screen content remained unchanged. No new apps were revealed in the app drawer. This indicates that either the swipe was ineffective, or there is no more content to scroll to in that direction. The agent is not closer to finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' through scrolling, as the view remains the same and the app is not visible.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[96,386],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search bar at the top of the app drawer, located at approximately [96, 386]. The search bar is currently inactive. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will become active, and the virtual keyboard will appear, allowing the agent to type the name of the app to search for (\\'Simple Gallery\\'). Actual Outcome: The tap action on the search bar at [96, 386] successfully activated the search bar. The placeholder text \"Search apps, web and more\" is now present in the search field, and the virtual keyboard has appeared on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling the search functionality for apps.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Simple Gallery\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Simple Gallery\\\\n\\' into the focused search bar. The search bar currently contains \"Search apps, web and more\". The predicted outcome is that \\'Simple Gallery\\' will be typed into the search bar, and the search will be initiated, displaying search results for \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Simple Gallery\\\\n\\' into the search bar was successful. The text was entered, the search was initiated, and a list of search results is now visible on the screen. The results include \\'Simple Gallery0\\', \\'Simple Gallery1\\', \\'Simple Gallery2\\', and so on. \\'Simple Gallery2\\' is highlighted. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully searching for the required app.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 17: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[292,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search result \\'Simple Gallery2\\' which is highlighted. The bounding box for this element is [260, 51, 324, 952], and the tap will be near its center at [292, 501]. This action is expected to open the \\'Simple Gallery\\' application. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Simple Gallery and view receipt.png\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'receipt.png\\' image is displayed full-screen or prominently within the Simple Gallery app.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully opened the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The current screen shows the app drawer, scrolled to the top. This action is intended to scroll the app drawer down, revealing more apps. The predicted outcome is that the list of apps will scroll, and \\'Simple Gallery\\' might become visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] successfully scrolled the app drawer downwards. New applications are now visible on the screen. \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not yet visible among the currently displayed apps. This action brought the agent closer to potentially finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' by revealing more apps, but the target app has not been located yet. Further scrolling is required.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down in the app drawer. The current screen shows the app drawer, but \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not visible. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will scroll, revealing more apps, and hopefully \\'Simple Gallery\\' will become visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] was performed. The screen content remained unchanged. No new apps were revealed in the app drawer. This indicates that either the swipe was ineffective, or there is no more content to scroll to in that direction. The agent is not closer to finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' through scrolling, as the view remains the same and the app is not visible.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[96,386],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search bar at the top of the app drawer, located at approximately [96, 386]. The search bar is currently inactive. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will become active, and the virtual keyboard will appear, allowing the agent to type the name of the app to search for (\\'Simple Gallery\\'). Actual Outcome: The tap action on the search bar at [96, 386] successfully activated the search bar. The placeholder text \"Search apps, web and more\" is now present in the search field, and the virtual keyboard has appeared on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling the search functionality for apps.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Simple Gallery\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Simple Gallery\\\\n\\' into the focused search bar. The search bar currently contains \"Search apps, web and more\". The predicted outcome is that \\'Simple Gallery\\' will be typed into the search bar, and the search will be initiated, displaying search results for \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Simple Gallery\\\\n\\' into the search bar was successful. The text was entered, the search was initiated, and a list of search results is now visible on the screen. The results include \\'Simple Gallery0\\', \\'Simple Gallery1\\', \\'Simple Gallery2\\', and so on. \\'Simple Gallery2\\' is highlighted. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully searching for the required app.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[292,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search result \\'Simple Gallery2\\' which is highlighted. The bounding box for this element is [260, 51, 324, 952], and the tap will be near its center at [292, 501]. This action is expected to open the \\'Simple Gallery\\' application. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Simple Gallery2\\' at approximately [292, 501] did not open the Simple Gallery app. Instead, the device navigated to the home screen. This action was a failure and did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To correct this, the agent should return to the app drawer, search for \\'Simple Gallery\\' again, and then try tapping on a different search result, such as \\'Simple Gallery0\\'.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.47\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [54, 712, 65, 797], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [123, 84, 148, 345], \\'text\\': \\'Sun; Oct 15\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 336, 722, 431], \\'text\\': \\'Gmail\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 561, 722, 676], \\'text\\': \\'Photos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [704, 781, 722, 921], \\'text\\': \\'YouTube\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [775, 295, 872, 712], \\'text\\': \\'0 @\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 72, 855, 233]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 298, 857, 466]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 535, 858, 706]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [628, 536, 729, 695]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [788, 764, 857, 930]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 764, 728, 928]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 299, 731, 463]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [900, 701, 947, 795]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [893, 801, 952, 922]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 823, 39, 899]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Use Simple Gallery to view the receipt. Please enter transactions in csv format including the header \"Date, Item, Amount\".\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [700, 500] to [300, 500]. The current screen shows the app drawer, scrolled to the top. This action is intended to scroll the app drawer down, revealing more apps. The predicted outcome is that the list of apps will scroll, and \\'Simple Gallery\\' might become visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] successfully scrolled the app drawer downwards. New applications are now visible on the screen. \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not yet visible among the currently displayed apps. This action brought the agent closer to potentially finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' by revealing more apps, but the target app has not been located yet. Further scrolling is required.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down in the app drawer. The current screen shows the app drawer, but \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not visible. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will scroll, revealing more apps, and hopefully \\'Simple Gallery\\' will become visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] was performed. The screen content remained unchanged. No new apps were revealed in the app drawer. This indicates that either the swipe was ineffective, or there is no more content to scroll to in that direction. The agent is not closer to finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' through scrolling, as the view remains the same and the app is not visible.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[96,386],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search bar at the top of the app drawer, located at approximately [96, 386]. The search bar is currently inactive. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will become active, and the virtual keyboard will appear, allowing the agent to type the name of the app to search for (\\'Simple Gallery\\'). Actual Outcome: The tap action on the search bar at [96, 386] successfully activated the search bar. The placeholder text \"Search apps, web and more\" is now present in the search field, and the virtual keyboard has appeared on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling the search functionality for apps.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Simple Gallery\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Simple Gallery\\\\n\\' into the focused search bar. The search bar currently contains \"Search apps, web and more\". The predicted outcome is that \\'Simple Gallery\\' will be typed into the search bar, and the search will be initiated, displaying search results for \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Simple Gallery\\\\n\\' into the search bar was successful. The text was entered, the search was initiated, and a list of search results is now visible on the screen. The results include \\'Simple Gallery0\\', \\'Simple Gallery1\\', \\'Simple Gallery2\\', and so on. \\'Simple Gallery2\\' is highlighted. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully searching for the required app.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[292,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search result \\'Simple Gallery2\\' which is highlighted. The bounding box for this element is [260, 51, 324, 952], and the tap will be near its center at [292, 501]. This action is expected to open the \\'Simple Gallery\\' application. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Simple Gallery2\\' at approximately [292, 501] did not open the Simple Gallery app. Instead, the device navigated to the home screen. This action was a failure and did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To correct this, the agent should return to the app drawer, search for \\'Simple Gallery\\' again, and then try tapping on a different search result, such as \\'Simple Gallery0\\'.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 18: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will open, displaying a list of installed applications. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Simple Gallery and view receipt.png\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'receipt.png\\' image is displayed full-screen or prominently within the Simple Gallery app.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully opened the app drawer.

The agent is currently in the app drawer. Initial attempts to scroll down the app drawer failed. An attempt to reveal an app search bar by swiping down scrolled the app list upwards. A swipe up action (from [700, 500] to [300, 500]) successfully scrolled the app drawer down once, revealing more apps.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The current screen shows the app drawer, but \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not visible. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will scroll, revealing more apps, and hopefully \\'Simple Gallery\\' will become visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] was performed. The screen content remained unchanged. No new apps were revealed in the app drawer. This indicates that either the swipe was ineffective, or there is no more content to scroll to in that direction. The agent is not closer to finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' through scrolling, as the view remains the same and the app is not visible.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[96,386],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search bar at the top of the app drawer, located at approximately [96, 386]. The search bar is currently inactive. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will become active, and the virtual keyboard will appear, allowing the agent to type the name of the app to search for (\\'Simple Gallery\\'). Actual Outcome: The tap action on the search bar at [96, 386] successfully activated the search bar. The placeholder text \"Search apps, web and more\" is now present in the search field, and the virtual keyboard has appeared on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling the search functionality for apps.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Simple Gallery\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Simple Gallery\\\\n\\' into the focused search bar. The search bar currently contains \"Search apps, web and more\". The predicted outcome is that \\'Simple Gallery\\' will be typed into the search bar, and the search will be initiated, displaying search results for \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Simple Gallery\\\\n\\' into the search bar was successful. The text was entered, the search was initiated, and a list of search results is now visible on the screen. The results include \\'Simple Gallery0\\', \\'Simple Gallery1\\', \\'Simple Gallery2\\', and so on. \\'Simple Gallery2\\' is highlighted. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully searching for the required app.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[292,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search result \\'Simple Gallery2\\' which is highlighted. The bounding box for this element is [260, 51, 324, 952], and the tap will be near its center at [292, 501]. This action is expected to open the \\'Simple Gallery\\' application. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Simple Gallery2\\' at approximately [292, 501] did not open the Simple Gallery app. Instead, the device navigated to the home screen. This action was a failure and did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To correct this, the agent should return to the app drawer, search for \\'Simple Gallery\\' again, and then try tapping on a different search result, such as \\'Simple Gallery0\\'.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will open, displaying a list of installed applications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900, 500] to [300, 500] successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications and a Google search bar at the top. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the app search functionality accessible again after the previous failed attempt to open the app led back to the home screen.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"Search apps, web and more\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nCreate a file in Markor, called receipt.md with the transactions from the receipt.png. Use Simple Gallery to view the receipt. Please enter transactions in csv format including the header \"Date, Item, Amount\".\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down in the app drawer. The current screen shows the app drawer, but \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not visible. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will scroll, revealing more apps, and hopefully \\'Simple Gallery\\' will become visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] was performed. The screen content remained unchanged. No new apps were revealed in the app drawer. This indicates that either the swipe was ineffective, or there is no more content to scroll to in that direction. The agent is not closer to finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' through scrolling, as the view remains the same and the app is not visible.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[96,386],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search bar at the top of the app drawer, located at approximately [96, 386]. The search bar is currently inactive. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will become active, and the virtual keyboard will appear, allowing the agent to type the name of the app to search for (\\'Simple Gallery\\'). Actual Outcome: The tap action on the search bar at [96, 386] successfully activated the search bar. The placeholder text \"Search apps, web and more\" is now present in the search field, and the virtual keyboard has appeared on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling the search functionality for apps.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Simple Gallery\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Simple Gallery\\\\n\\' into the focused search bar. The search bar currently contains \"Search apps, web and more\". The predicted outcome is that \\'Simple Gallery\\' will be typed into the search bar, and the search will be initiated, displaying search results for \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Simple Gallery\\\\n\\' into the search bar was successful. The text was entered, the search was initiated, and a list of search results is now visible on the screen. The results include \\'Simple Gallery0\\', \\'Simple Gallery1\\', \\'Simple Gallery2\\', and so on. \\'Simple Gallery2\\' is highlighted. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully searching for the required app.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[292,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search result \\'Simple Gallery2\\' which is highlighted. The bounding box for this element is [260, 51, 324, 952], and the tap will be near its center at [292, 501]. This action is expected to open the \\'Simple Gallery\\' application. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Simple Gallery2\\' at approximately [292, 501] did not open the Simple Gallery app. Instead, the device navigated to the home screen. This action was a failure and did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To correct this, the agent should return to the app drawer, search for \\'Simple Gallery\\' again, and then try tapping on a different search result, such as \\'Simple Gallery0\\'.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will open, displaying a list of installed applications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900, 500] to [300, 500] successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications and a Google search bar at the top. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the app search functionality accessible again after the previous failed attempt to open the app led back to the home screen.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 19: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[98,440],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Google search bar at the top of the app drawer, located approximately at [98, 440]. The search bar is currently inactive. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will become active, and the virtual keyboard will appear, allowing the agent to type the name of the app to search for (\\'Simple Gallery\\'). The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Simple Gallery and view receipt.png\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'receipt.png\\' image is displayed full-screen or prominently within the Simple Gallery app.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully opened the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[96,386],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search bar at the top of the app drawer, located at approximately [96, 386]. The search bar is currently inactive. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will become active, and the virtual keyboard will appear, allowing the agent to type the name of the app to search for (\\'Simple Gallery\\'). Actual Outcome: The tap action on the search bar at [96, 386] successfully activated the search bar. The placeholder text \"Search apps, web and more\" is now present in the search field, and the virtual keyboard has appeared on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling the search functionality for apps.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Simple Gallery\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Simple Gallery\\\\n\\' into the focused search bar. The search bar currently contains \"Search apps, web and more\". The predicted outcome is that \\'Simple Gallery\\' will be typed into the search bar, and the search will be initiated, displaying search results for \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Simple Gallery\\\\n\\' into the search bar was successful. The text was entered, the search was initiated, and a list of search results is now visible on the screen. The results include \\'Simple Gallery0\\', \\'Simple Gallery1\\', \\'Simple Gallery2\\', and so on. \\'Simple Gallery2\\' is highlighted. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully searching for the required app.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[292,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search result \\'Simple Gallery2\\' which is highlighted. The bounding box for this element is [260, 51, 324, 952], and the tap will be near its center at [292, 501]. This action is expected to open the \\'Simple Gallery\\' application. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Simple Gallery2\\' at approximately [292, 501] did not open the Simple Gallery app. Instead, the device navigated to the home screen. This action was a failure and did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To correct this, the agent should return to the app drawer, search for \\'Simple Gallery\\' again, and then try tapping on a different search result, such as \\'Simple Gallery0\\'.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will open, displaying a list of installed applications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900, 500] to [300, 500] successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications and a Google search bar at the top. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the app search functionality accessible again after the previous failed attempt to open the app led back to the home screen.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[98,440],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Google search bar at the top of the app drawer, located approximately at [98, 440]. The search bar is currently inactive. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will become active, and the virtual keyboard will appear, allowing the agent to type the name of the app to search for (\\'Simple Gallery\\'). Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Google search bar at [98, 440] was successful. The search bar became active, and the virtual keyboard appeared on the screen. The placeholder text \"Search apps, web and more\" is now in the search field. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling the search functionality for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.49\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [54, 139, 66, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [84, 193, 113, 805], \\'text\\': \\'Search apps; web and more\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [228, 69, 249, 264], \\'text\\': \\'Pro Expense\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [228, 331, 244, 447], \\'text\\': \\'Markor\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [228, 574, 244, 650], \\'text\\': \\'Files\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [228, 776, 249, 895], \\'text\\': \\'Clipper\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [419, 208, 433, 231], \\'text\\': \\'2\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [147, 296, 250, 488]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [148, 744, 251, 930]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [148, 73, 250, 264]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [148, 518, 250, 707]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [409, 92, 444, 168]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [287, 93, 322, 170]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [348, 92, 384, 170]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [409, 185, 444, 252]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [82, 858, 110, 910]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"2\", text=\"Search apps, web and more\", resource-id=\"com.google.android.apps.nexuslauncher:id/input\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"com.google.android.apps.nexuslauncher\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[214,156][886,301]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"Search apps, web and more\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Use Simple Gallery to view the receipt. Please enter transactions in csv format including the header \"Date, Item, Amount\".\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[96,386],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search bar at the top of the app drawer, located at approximately [96, 386]. The search bar is currently inactive. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will become active, and the virtual keyboard will appear, allowing the agent to type the name of the app to search for (\\'Simple Gallery\\'). Actual Outcome: The tap action on the search bar at [96, 386] successfully activated the search bar. The placeholder text \"Search apps, web and more\" is now present in the search field, and the virtual keyboard has appeared on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling the search functionality for apps.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Simple Gallery\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Simple Gallery\\\\n\\' into the focused search bar. The search bar currently contains \"Search apps, web and more\". The predicted outcome is that \\'Simple Gallery\\' will be typed into the search bar, and the search will be initiated, displaying search results for \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Simple Gallery\\\\n\\' into the search bar was successful. The text was entered, the search was initiated, and a list of search results is now visible on the screen. The results include \\'Simple Gallery0\\', \\'Simple Gallery1\\', \\'Simple Gallery2\\', and so on. \\'Simple Gallery2\\' is highlighted. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully searching for the required app.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[292,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search result \\'Simple Gallery2\\' which is highlighted. The bounding box for this element is [260, 51, 324, 952], and the tap will be near its center at [292, 501]. This action is expected to open the \\'Simple Gallery\\' application. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Simple Gallery2\\' at approximately [292, 501] did not open the Simple Gallery app. Instead, the device navigated to the home screen. This action was a failure and did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To correct this, the agent should return to the app drawer, search for \\'Simple Gallery\\' again, and then try tapping on a different search result, such as \\'Simple Gallery0\\'.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will open, displaying a list of installed applications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900, 500] to [300, 500] successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications and a Google search bar at the top. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the app search functionality accessible again after the previous failed attempt to open the app led back to the home screen.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[98,440],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Google search bar at the top of the app drawer, located approximately at [98, 440]. The search bar is currently inactive. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will become active, and the virtual keyboard will appear, allowing the agent to type the name of the app to search for (\\'Simple Gallery\\'). Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Google search bar at [98, 440] was successful. The search bar became active, and the virtual keyboard appeared on the screen. The placeholder text \"Search apps, web and more\" is now in the search field. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling the search functionality for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 20: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Simple Gallery\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Simple Gallery\\n\\' into the focused search bar. The search bar currently contains \"Search apps, web and more\". The predicted outcome is that \\'Simple Gallery\\' will be typed into the search bar, and the search will be initiated, displaying search results for \\'Simple Gallery\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Simple Gallery and view receipt.png\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'receipt.png\\' image is displayed full-screen or prominently within the Simple Gallery app.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully opened the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The search bar currently contains \"Search apps, web and more\". The predicted outcome is that \\'Simple Gallery\\' will be typed into the search bar, and the search will be initiated, displaying search results for \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Simple Gallery\\\\n\\' into the search bar was successful. The text was entered, the search was initiated, and a list of search results is now visible on the screen. The results include \\'Simple Gallery0\\', \\'Simple Gallery1\\', \\'Simple Gallery2\\', and so on. \\'Simple Gallery2\\' is highlighted. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully searching for the required app.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[292,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search result \\'Simple Gallery2\\' which is highlighted. The bounding box for this element is [260, 51, 324, 952], and the tap will be near its center at [292, 501]. This action is expected to open the \\'Simple Gallery\\' application. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Simple Gallery2\\' at approximately [292, 501] did not open the Simple Gallery app. Instead, the device navigated to the home screen. This action was a failure and did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To correct this, the agent should return to the app drawer, search for \\'Simple Gallery\\' again, and then try tapping on a different search result, such as \\'Simple Gallery0\\'.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will open, displaying a list of installed applications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900, 500] to [300, 500] successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications and a Google search bar at the top. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the app search functionality accessible again after the previous failed attempt to open the app led back to the home screen.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[98,440],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Google search bar at the top of the app drawer, located approximately at [98, 440]. The search bar is currently inactive. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will become active, and the virtual keyboard will appear, allowing the agent to type the name of the app to search for (\\'Simple Gallery\\'). Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Google search bar at [98, 440] was successful. The search bar became active, and the virtual keyboard appeared on the screen. The placeholder text \"Search apps, web and more\" is now in the search field. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling the search functionality for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Simple Gallery\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Simple Gallery\\n\\' into the focused search bar. The search bar currently contains \"Search apps, web and more\". The predicted outcome is that \\'Simple Gallery\\' will be typed into the search bar, and the search will be initiated, displaying search results for \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \"Simple Gallery\\\\n\" into the search bar was successful. The text \"Simple Gallery\" was entered into the search bar, and the search was initiated. A list of search results, including \"Simple Gallery0\", \"Simple Gallery1\", \"Simple Gallery2\", etc., is now displayed on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully searching for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app again after a previous failed attempt to open it.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.49\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [83, 193, 112, 518], \\'text\\': \\'Simple Gallery\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [158, 204, 181, 483], \\'text\\': \\'Simple Galleryo\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [220, 204, 241, 475], \\'text\\': \\'Simple Gallery]\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [281, 204, 304, 483], \\'text\\': \\'Simple Gallery2\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [342, 204, 365, 483], \\'text\\': \\'Simple Gallery3\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [402, 203, 427, 484], \\'text\\': \\'Simple Gallery4\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [463, 203, 488, 485], \\'text\\': \\'Simple Gallery5\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [526, 204, 549, 483], \\'text\\': \\'Simple Gallery6\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [587, 203, 609, 479], \\'text\\': \\'Simple Gallery7\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [649, 204, 671, 483], \\'text\\': \\'Simple Gallery8\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [710, 204, 732, 481], \\'text\\': \\'Simple Galleryg\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [260, 51, 324, 952]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [383, 52, 446, 952]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [506, 51, 568, 952]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [139, 52, 201, 954]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [567, 54, 629, 953]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [629, 55, 690, 954]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [445, 54, 507, 953]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [323, 53, 384, 954]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [691, 50, 749, 953]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"2\", text=\"\", resource-id=\"\", class=\"android.widget.LinearLayout\", package=\"com.google.android.apps.nexuslauncher\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"false\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[57,622][1023,769]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nCreate a file in Markor, called receipt.md with the transactions from the receipt.png. Use Simple Gallery to view the receipt. Please enter transactions in csv format including the header \"Date, Item, Amount\".\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Simple Gallery\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Simple Gallery\\\\n\\' into the focused search bar. The search bar currently contains \"Search apps, web and more\". The predicted outcome is that \\'Simple Gallery\\' will be typed into the search bar, and the search will be initiated, displaying search results for \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Simple Gallery\\\\n\\' into the search bar was successful. The text was entered, the search was initiated, and a list of search results is now visible on the screen. The results include \\'Simple Gallery0\\', \\'Simple Gallery1\\', \\'Simple Gallery2\\', and so on. \\'Simple Gallery2\\' is highlighted. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully searching for the required app.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[292,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search result \\'Simple Gallery2\\' which is highlighted. The bounding box for this element is [260, 51, 324, 952], and the tap will be near its center at [292, 501]. This action is expected to open the \\'Simple Gallery\\' application. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Simple Gallery2\\' at approximately [292, 501] did not open the Simple Gallery app. Instead, the device navigated to the home screen. This action was a failure and did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To correct this, the agent should return to the app drawer, search for \\'Simple Gallery\\' again, and then try tapping on a different search result, such as \\'Simple Gallery0\\'.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will open, displaying a list of installed applications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900, 500] to [300, 500] successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications and a Google search bar at the top. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the app search functionality accessible again after the previous failed attempt to open the app led back to the home screen.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[98,440],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Google search bar at the top of the app drawer, located approximately at [98, 440]. The search bar is currently inactive. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will become active, and the virtual keyboard will appear, allowing the agent to type the name of the app to search for (\\'Simple Gallery\\'). Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Google search bar at [98, 440] was successful. The search bar became active, and the virtual keyboard appeared on the screen. The placeholder text \"Search apps, web and more\" is now in the search field. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling the search functionality for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Simple Gallery\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Simple Gallery\\n\\' into the focused search bar. The search bar currently contains \"Search apps, web and more\". The predicted outcome is that \\'Simple Gallery\\' will be typed into the search bar, and the search will be initiated, displaying search results for \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \"Simple Gallery\\\\n\" into the search bar was successful. The text \"Simple Gallery\" was entered into the search bar, and the search was initiated. A list of search results, including \"Simple Gallery0\", \"Simple Gallery1\", \"Simple Gallery2\", etc., is now displayed on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully searching for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app again after a previous failed attempt to open it.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 21: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[170,503],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search result \\'Simple Gallery0\\' located at approximately [170, 503]. This is the first item in the list of search results for \\'Simple Gallery\\'. The predicted outcome is that the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app will open. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Simple Gallery and view receipt.png\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'receipt.png\\' image is displayed full-screen or prominently within the Simple Gallery app.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully opened the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[292,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search result \\'Simple Gallery2\\' which is highlighted. The bounding box for this element is [260, 51, 324, 952], and the tap will be near its center at [292, 501]. This action is expected to open the \\'Simple Gallery\\' application. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Simple Gallery2\\' at approximately [292, 501] did not open the Simple Gallery app. Instead, the device navigated to the home screen. This action was a failure and did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To correct this, the agent should return to the app drawer, search for \\'Simple Gallery\\' again, and then try tapping on a different search result, such as \\'Simple Gallery0\\'.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will open, displaying a list of installed applications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900, 500] to [300, 500] successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications and a Google search bar at the top. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the app search functionality accessible again after the previous failed attempt to open the app led back to the home screen.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[98,440],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Google search bar at the top of the app drawer, located approximately at [98, 440]. The search bar is currently inactive. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will become active, and the virtual keyboard will appear, allowing the agent to type the name of the app to search for (\\'Simple Gallery\\'). Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Google search bar at [98, 440] was successful. The search bar became active, and the virtual keyboard appeared on the screen. The placeholder text \"Search apps, web and more\" is now in the search field. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling the search functionality for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Simple Gallery\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Simple Gallery\\n\\' into the focused search bar. The search bar currently contains \"Search apps, web and more\". The predicted outcome is that \\'Simple Gallery\\' will be typed into the search bar, and the search will be initiated, displaying search results for \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \"Simple Gallery\\\\n\" into the search bar was successful. The text \"Simple Gallery\" was entered into the search bar, and the search was initiated. A list of search results, including \"Simple Gallery0\", \"Simple Gallery1\", \"Simple Gallery2\", etc., is now displayed on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully searching for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app again after a previous failed attempt to open it.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[170,503],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search result \\'Simple Gallery0\\' located at approximately [170, 503]. This is the first item in the list of search results for \\'Simple Gallery\\'. The predicted outcome is that the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app will open. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Simple Gallery0\\' (located approximately at [170, 503] in the previous screen) did not open the Simple Gallery app. Instead, the device returned to the home screen. This action was a failure and did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. This is consistent with the failure when tapping \\'Simple Gallery2\\' previously.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 46, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.50\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [54, 712, 65, 797], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [123, 84, 148, 345], \\'text\\': \\'Sun; Oct 15\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 336, 722, 431], \\'text\\': \\'Gmail\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 561, 722, 676], \\'text\\': \\'Photos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [704, 781, 722, 921], \\'text\\': \\'YouTube\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [775, 295, 872, 712], \\'text\\': \\'0 @\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 72, 855, 233]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 298, 857, 466]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 535, 858, 705]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [628, 536, 729, 695]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 764, 728, 928]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [788, 765, 857, 930]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 299, 730, 463]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [900, 701, 948, 795]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [893, 801, 952, 923]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 823, 39, 899]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[292,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search result \\'Simple Gallery2\\' which is highlighted. The bounding box for this element is [260, 51, 324, 952], and the tap will be near its center at [292, 501]. This action is expected to open the \\'Simple Gallery\\' application. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Simple Gallery2\\' at approximately [292, 501] did not open the Simple Gallery app. Instead, the device navigated to the home screen. This action was a failure and did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To correct this, the agent should return to the app drawer, search for \\'Simple Gallery\\' again, and then try tapping on a different search result, such as \\'Simple Gallery0\\'.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will open, displaying a list of installed applications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900, 500] to [300, 500] successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications and a Google search bar at the top. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the app search functionality accessible again after the previous failed attempt to open the app led back to the home screen.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[98,440],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Google search bar at the top of the app drawer, located approximately at [98, 440]. The search bar is currently inactive. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will become active, and the virtual keyboard will appear, allowing the agent to type the name of the app to search for (\\'Simple Gallery\\'). Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Google search bar at [98, 440] was successful. The search bar became active, and the virtual keyboard appeared on the screen. The placeholder text \"Search apps, web and more\" is now in the search field. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling the search functionality for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Simple Gallery\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Simple Gallery\\n\\' into the focused search bar. The search bar currently contains \"Search apps, web and more\". The predicted outcome is that \\'Simple Gallery\\' will be typed into the search bar, and the search will be initiated, displaying search results for \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \"Simple Gallery\\\\n\" into the search bar was successful. The text \"Simple Gallery\" was entered into the search bar, and the search was initiated. A list of search results, including \"Simple Gallery0\", \"Simple Gallery1\", \"Simple Gallery2\", etc., is now displayed on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully searching for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app again after a previous failed attempt to open it.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[170,503],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search result \\'Simple Gallery0\\' located at approximately [170, 503]. This is the first item in the list of search results for \\'Simple Gallery\\'. The predicted outcome is that the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app will open. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Simple Gallery0\\' (located approximately at [170, 503] in the previous screen) did not open the Simple Gallery app. Instead, the device returned to the home screen. This action was a failure and did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. This is consistent with the failure when tapping \\'Simple Gallery2\\' previously.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 22: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (e.g., from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will open, displaying a list of installed applications. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Simple Gallery and view receipt.png\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'receipt.png\\' image is displayed full-screen or prominently within the Simple Gallery app.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully opened the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The current screen is the home screen. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will open, displaying a list of installed applications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900, 500] to [300, 500] successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications and a Google search bar at the top. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the app search functionality accessible again after the previous failed attempt to open the app led back to the home screen.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[98,440],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Google search bar at the top of the app drawer, located approximately at [98, 440]. The search bar is currently inactive. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will become active, and the virtual keyboard will appear, allowing the agent to type the name of the app to search for (\\'Simple Gallery\\'). Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Google search bar at [98, 440] was successful. The search bar became active, and the virtual keyboard appeared on the screen. The placeholder text \"Search apps, web and more\" is now in the search field. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling the search functionality for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Simple Gallery\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Simple Gallery\\n\\' into the focused search bar. The search bar currently contains \"Search apps, web and more\". The predicted outcome is that \\'Simple Gallery\\' will be typed into the search bar, and the search will be initiated, displaying search results for \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \"Simple Gallery\\\\n\" into the search bar was successful. The text \"Simple Gallery\" was entered into the search bar, and the search was initiated. A list of search results, including \"Simple Gallery0\", \"Simple Gallery1\", \"Simple Gallery2\", etc., is now displayed on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully searching for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app again after a previous failed attempt to open it.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[170,503],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search result \\'Simple Gallery0\\' located at approximately [170, 503]. This is the first item in the list of search results for \\'Simple Gallery\\'. The predicted outcome is that the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app will open. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Simple Gallery0\\' (located approximately at [170, 503] in the previous screen) did not open the Simple Gallery app. Instead, the device returned to the home screen. This action was a failure and did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. This is consistent with the failure when tapping \\'Simple Gallery2\\' previously.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (e.g., from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will open, displaying a list of installed applications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900, 500] to [300, 500] successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications and a search bar at the top. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the app search functionality accessible again.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The current screen is the home screen. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will open, displaying a list of installed applications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900, 500] to [300, 500] successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications and a Google search bar at the top. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the app search functionality accessible again after the previous failed attempt to open the app led back to the home screen.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[98,440],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Google search bar at the top of the app drawer, located approximately at [98, 440]. The search bar is currently inactive. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will become active, and the virtual keyboard will appear, allowing the agent to type the name of the app to search for (\\'Simple Gallery\\'). Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Google search bar at [98, 440] was successful. The search bar became active, and the virtual keyboard appeared on the screen. The placeholder text \"Search apps, web and more\" is now in the search field. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling the search functionality for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Simple Gallery\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Simple Gallery\\n\\' into the focused search bar. The search bar currently contains \"Search apps, web and more\". The predicted outcome is that \\'Simple Gallery\\' will be typed into the search bar, and the search will be initiated, displaying search results for \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \"Simple Gallery\\\\n\" into the search bar was successful. The text \"Simple Gallery\" was entered into the search bar, and the search was initiated. A list of search results, including \"Simple Gallery0\", \"Simple Gallery1\", \"Simple Gallery2\", etc., is now displayed on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully searching for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app again after a previous failed attempt to open it.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[170,503],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search result \\'Simple Gallery0\\' located at approximately [170, 503]. This is the first item in the list of search results for \\'Simple Gallery\\'. The predicted outcome is that the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app will open. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Simple Gallery0\\' (located approximately at [170, 503] in the previous screen) did not open the Simple Gallery app. Instead, the device returned to the home screen. This action was a failure and did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. This is consistent with the failure when tapping \\'Simple Gallery2\\' previously.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (e.g., from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will open, displaying a list of installed applications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900, 500] to [300, 500] successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications and a search bar at the top. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the app search functionality accessible again.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 23: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

The search bar is currently inactive. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will become active, and the virtual keyboard will appear, allowing the agent to type the name of the app to search for (\\'Simple Gallery\\').

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The search bar is currently inactive. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will become active, and the virtual keyboard will appear, allowing the agent to type the name of the app to search for (\\'Simple Gallery\\'). Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Google search bar at [98, 440] was successful. The search bar became active, and the virtual keyboard appeared on the screen. The placeholder text \"Search apps, web and more\" is now in the search field. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling the search functionality for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Simple Gallery\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Simple Gallery\\n\\' into the focused search bar. The search bar currently contains \"Search apps, web and more\". The predicted outcome is that \\'Simple Gallery\\' will be typed into the search bar, and the search will be initiated, displaying search results for \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \"Simple Gallery\\\\n\" into the search bar was successful. The text \"Simple Gallery\" was entered into the search bar, and the search was initiated. A list of search results, including \"Simple Gallery0\", \"Simple Gallery1\", \"Simple Gallery2\", etc., is now displayed on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully searching for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app again after a previous failed attempt to open it.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[170,503],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search result \\'Simple Gallery0\\' located at approximately [170, 503]. This is the first item in the list of search results for \\'Simple Gallery\\'. The predicted outcome is that the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app will open. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Simple Gallery0\\' (located approximately at [170, 503] in the previous screen) did not open the Simple Gallery app. Instead, the device returned to the home screen. This action was a failure and did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. This is consistent with the failure when tapping \\'Simple Gallery2\\' previously.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (e.g., from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will open, displaying a list of installed applications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900, 500] to [300, 500] successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications and a search bar at the top. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the app search functionality accessible again.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[98,440],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Google search bar at the top of the app drawer, located approximately at [98, 440]. The search bar is currently inactive. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will become active, and the virtual keyboard will appear, allowing the agent to type the name of the app to search for (\\'Simple Gallery\\'). Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Google search bar at [98, 440] was successful. The search bar became active, and the virtual keyboard appeared on the screen. The placeholder text \"Search apps, web and more\" is now in the search field. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling the search functionality for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 132], \\'text\\': \\'15.51\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [84, 194, 112, 804], \\'text\\': \\'Search apps; web and more\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [229, 111, 244, 223], \\'text\\': \\'Markor\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [228, 350, 244, 428], \\'text\\': \\'Files\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [228, 552, 249, 673], \\'text\\': \\'Clipper\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [228, 739, 249, 935], \\'text\\': \\'Pro Expense\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [419, 208, 433, 231], \\'text\\': \\'2\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [149, 740, 249, 930]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [148, 519, 249, 706]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [149, 301, 250, 480]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [148, 80, 249, 257]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [409, 92, 444, 168]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [347, 92, 385, 170]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [409, 186, 444, 251]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [82, 856, 110, 912]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [287, 94, 322, 169]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"2\", text=\"Search apps, web and more\", resource-id=\"com.google.android.apps.nexuslauncher:id/input\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"com.google.android.apps.nexuslauncher\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[214,156][886,301]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"Search apps, web and more\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information.

Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The search bar is currently inactive. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will become active, and the virtual keyboard will appear, allowing the agent to type the name of the app to search for (\\'Simple Gallery\\'). Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Google search bar at [98, 440] was successful. The search bar became active, and the virtual keyboard appeared on the screen. The placeholder text \"Search apps, web and more\" is now in the search field. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling the search functionality for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Simple Gallery\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Simple Gallery\\n\\' into the focused search bar. The search bar currently contains \"Search apps, web and more\". The predicted outcome is that \\'Simple Gallery\\' will be typed into the search bar, and the search will be initiated, displaying search results for \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \"Simple Gallery\\\\n\" into the search bar was successful. The text \"Simple Gallery\" was entered into the search bar, and the search was initiated. A list of search results, including \"Simple Gallery0\", \"Simple Gallery1\", \"Simple Gallery2\", etc., is now displayed on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully searching for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app again after a previous failed attempt to open it.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[170,503],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search result \\'Simple Gallery0\\' located at approximately [170, 503]. This is the first item in the list of search results for \\'Simple Gallery\\'. The predicted outcome is that the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app will open. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Simple Gallery0\\' (located approximately at [170, 503] in the previous screen) did not open the Simple Gallery app. Instead, the device returned to the home screen. This action was a failure and did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. This is consistent with the failure when tapping \\'Simple Gallery2\\' previously.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (e.g., from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will open, displaying a list of installed applications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900, 500] to [300, 500] successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications and a search bar at the top. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the app search functionality accessible again.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[98,440],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Google search bar at the top of the app drawer, located approximately at [98, 440]. The search bar is currently inactive. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will become active, and the virtual keyboard will appear, allowing the agent to type the name of the app to search for (\\'Simple Gallery\\'). Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Google search bar at [98, 440] was successful. The search bar became active, and the virtual keyboard appeared on the screen. The placeholder text \"Search apps, web and more\" is now in the search field. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling the search functionality for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 24: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Simple Gallery\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Simple Gallery\\\\n\\' into the focused search bar. The search bar currently contains the placeholder text \"Search apps, web and more\". The predicted outcome is that \\'Simple Gallery\\' will be typed into the search bar, and the search will be initiated, displaying search results for \\'Simple Gallery\\'.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Simple Gallery0\\' (located approximately at [170, 503] in the previous screen) did not open the Simple Gallery app. Instead, the device returned to the home screen. This action was a failure and did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.

The current screen is the home screen. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will open, displaying a list of installed applications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900, 500] to [300, 500] successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications and a search bar at the top. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the app search functionality accessible again.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[98,440],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Google search bar at the top of the app drawer, located approximately at [98, 440]. The search bar is currently inactive. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will become active, and the virtual keyboard will appear, allowing the agent to type the name of the app to search for (\\'Simple Gallery\\'). Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Google search bar at [98, 440] was successful. The search bar became active, and the virtual keyboard appeared on the screen. The placeholder text \"Search apps, web and more\" is now in the search field. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling the search functionality for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Simple Gallery\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Simple Gallery\\\\n\\' into the focused search bar. The search bar currently contains the placeholder text \"Search apps, web and more\". The predicted outcome is that \\'Simple Gallery\\' will be typed into the search bar, and the search will be initiated, displaying search results for \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \"Simple Gallery\\\\n\" into the search bar was successful. The text \"Simple Gallery\" was entered into the search bar, and a list of search results, including \"Simple Gallery0\", \"Simple Gallery1\", \"Simple Gallery2\", etc., is now displayed on the screen. The item \\'Simple Gallery2\\' is highlighted. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully searching for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The predicted outcome is that \\'Simple Gallery\\' will be typed into the search bar, and the search will be initiated, displaying search results for \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \"Simple Gallery\\\\n\" into the search bar was successful. The text \"Simple Gallery\" was entered into the search bar, and the search was initiated. A list of search results, including \"Simple Gallery0\", \"Simple Gallery1\", \"Simple Gallery2\", etc., is now displayed on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully searching for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app again after a previous failed attempt to open it.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

This is the first item in the list of search results for \\'Simple Gallery\\'. The predicted outcome is that the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app will open. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Simple Gallery0\\' (located approximately at [170, 503] in the previous screen) did not open the Simple Gallery app. Instead, the device returned to the home screen. This action was a failure and did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. This is consistent with the failure when tapping \\'Simple Gallery2\\' previously.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (e.g., from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will open, displaying a list of installed applications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900, 500] to [300, 500] successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications and a search bar at the top. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the app search functionality accessible again.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[98,440],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Google search bar at the top of the app drawer, located approximately at [98, 440]. The search bar is currently inactive. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will become active, and the virtual keyboard will appear, allowing the agent to type the name of the app to search for (\\'Simple Gallery\\'). Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Google search bar at [98, 440] was successful. The search bar became active, and the virtual keyboard appeared on the screen. The placeholder text \"Search apps, web and more\" is now in the search field. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling the search functionality for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Simple Gallery\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Simple Gallery\\\\n\\' into the focused search bar. The search bar currently contains the placeholder text \"Search apps, web and more\". The predicted outcome is that \\'Simple Gallery\\' will be typed into the search bar, and the search will be initiated, displaying search results for \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \"Simple Gallery\\\\n\" into the search bar was successful. The text \"Simple Gallery\" was entered into the search bar, and a list of search results, including \"Simple Gallery0\", \"Simple Gallery1\", \"Simple Gallery2\", etc., is now displayed on the screen.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is the first item in the list of search results for \\'Simple Gallery\\'. The predicted outcome is that the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app will open. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Simple Gallery0\\' (located approximately at [170, 503] in the previous screen) did not open the Simple Gallery app. Instead, the device returned to the home screen. This action was a failure and did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. This is consistent with the failure when tapping \\'Simple Gallery2\\' previously.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (e.g., from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will open, displaying a list of installed applications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900, 500] to [300, 500] successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications and a search bar at the top. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the app search functionality accessible again.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[98,440],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Google search bar at the top of the app drawer, located approximately at [98, 440]. The search bar is currently inactive. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will become active, and the virtual keyboard will appear, allowing the agent to type the name of the app to search for (\\'Simple Gallery\\'). Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Google search bar at [98, 440] was successful. The search bar became active, and the virtual keyboard appeared on the screen. The placeholder text \"Search apps, web and more\" is now in the search field. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling the search functionality for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Simple Gallery\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Simple Gallery\\\\n\\' into the focused search bar. The search bar currently contains the placeholder text \"Search apps, web and more\". The predicted outcome is that \\'Simple Gallery\\' will be typed into the search bar, and the search will be initiated, displaying search results for \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \"Simple Gallery\\\\n\" into the search bar was successful. The text \"Simple Gallery\" was entered into the search bar, and a list of search results, including \"Simple Gallery0\", \"Simple Gallery1\", \"Simple Gallery2\", etc., is now displayed on the screen. The item \\'Simple Gallery2\\' is highlighted. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully searching for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[230,339],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'Simple Gallery1\\' from the search results. The text \\'Simple Gallery]\\' is detected with bounding box [220, 204, 241, 475], and the tap will be near its center at [230, 339]. The predicted outcome is that the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app will open. If this fails, the next step will be to try a different approach, like manually scrolling through the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'Simple Gallery1\\' (located near [230, 339] in the previous screen) failed to open the Simple Gallery app. Instead, the device returned to the home screen. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal and confirms that launching \\'Simple Gallery\\' from the search results is not a viable approach.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Use Simple Gallery to view the receipt. Please enter transactions in csv format including the header \"Date, Item, Amount\".\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[170,503],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search result \\'Simple Gallery0\\' located at approximately [170, 503]. This is the first item in the list of search results for \\'Simple Gallery\\'. The predicted outcome is that the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app will open. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Simple Gallery0\\' (located approximately at [170, 503] in the previous screen) did not open the Simple Gallery app. Instead, the device returned to the home screen. This action was a failure and did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. This is consistent with the failure when tapping \\'Simple Gallery2\\' previously.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (e.g., from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will open, displaying a list of installed applications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900, 500] to [300, 500] successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications and a search bar at the top. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the app search functionality accessible again.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[98,440],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Google search bar at the top of the app drawer, located approximately at [98, 440]. The search bar is currently inactive. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will become active, and the virtual keyboard will appear, allowing the agent to type the name of the app to search for (\\'Simple Gallery\\'). Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Google search bar at [98, 440] was successful. The search bar became active, and the virtual keyboard appeared on the screen. The placeholder text \"Search apps, web and more\" is now in the search field. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling the search functionality for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Simple Gallery\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Simple Gallery\\\\n\\' into the focused search bar. The search bar currently contains the placeholder text \"Search apps, web and more\". The predicted outcome is that \\'Simple Gallery\\' will be typed into the search bar, and the search will be initiated, displaying search results for \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \"Simple Gallery\\\\n\" into the search bar was successful. The text \"Simple Gallery\" was entered into the search bar, and a list of search results, including \"Simple Gallery0\", \"Simple Gallery1\", \"Simple Gallery2\", etc., is now displayed on the screen.

The text \\'Simple Gallery]\\' is detected with bounding box [220, 204, 241, 475], and the tap will be near its center at [230, 339]. The predicted outcome is that the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app will open. If this fails, the next step will be to try a different approach, like manually scrolling through the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'Simple Gallery1\\' (located near [230, 339] in the previous screen) failed to open the Simple Gallery app. Instead, the device returned to the home screen. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal and confirms that launching \\'Simple Gallery\\' from the search results is not a viable approach.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 26: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (e.g., from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Google search bar at [98, 440] was successful. The search bar became active, and the virtual keyboard appeared on the screen. The placeholder text \"Search apps, web and more\" is now in the search field.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The current screen is the home screen. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will open, displaying a list of installed applications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900, 500] to [300, 500] successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications and a search bar at the top. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the app search functionality accessible again.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[98,440],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Google search bar at the top of the app drawer, located approximately at [98, 440]. The search bar is currently inactive. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will become active, and the virtual keyboard will appear, allowing the agent to type the name of the app to search for (\\'Simple Gallery\\'). Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Google search bar at [98, 440] was successful. The search bar became active, and the virtual keyboard appeared on the screen. The placeholder text \"Search apps, web and more\" is now in the search field. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling the search functionality for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Simple Gallery\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Simple Gallery\\\\n\\' into the focused search bar. The search bar currently contains the placeholder text \"Search apps, web and more\". The predicted outcome is that \\'Simple Gallery\\' will be typed into the search bar, and the search will be initiated, displaying search results for \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \"Simple Gallery\\\\n\" into the search bar was successful. The text \"Simple Gallery\" was entered into the search bar, and a list of search results, including \"Simple Gallery0\", \"Simple Gallery1\", \"Simple Gallery2\", etc., is now displayed on the screen. The item \\'Simple Gallery2\\' is highlighted. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully searching for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[230,339],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'Simple Gallery1\\' from the search results. The text \\'Simple Gallery]\\' is detected with bounding box [220, 204, 241, 475], and the tap will be near its center at [230, 339]. The predicted outcome is that the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app will open. If this fails, the next step will be to try a different approach, like manually scrolling through the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'Simple Gallery1\\' (located near [230, 339] in the previous screen) failed to open the Simple Gallery app. Instead, the device returned to the home screen. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal and confirms that launching \\'Simple Gallery\\' from the search results is not a viable approach.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (e.g., from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will open, displaying a list of installed applications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900, 500] to [300, 500] successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications (e.g., Pro Expense, Markor, Files, Clipper, etc.) and a search bar at the top. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the app list accessible for manual searching, which is the current strategy after search-based attempts failed.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 27: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the middle of the screen (e.g., from [700, 500] to [300, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. The app drawer is currently displaying the first page of apps. The predicted outcome is that the app list will scroll, revealing more applications, potentially including \\'Simple Gallery\\'.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[98,440],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Google search bar at the top of the app drawer, located approximately at [98, 440]. The search bar is currently inactive. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will become active, and the virtual keyboard will appear, allowing the agent to type the name of the app to search for (\\'Simple Gallery\\'). Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Google search bar at [98, 440] was successful. The search bar became active, and the virtual keyboard appeared on the screen. The placeholder text \"Search apps, web and more\" is now in the search field. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling the search functionality for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Simple Gallery\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Simple Gallery\\\\n\\' into the focused search bar. The search bar currently contains the placeholder text \"Search apps, web and more\". The predicted outcome is that \\'Simple Gallery\\' will be typed into the search bar, and the search will be initiated, displaying search results for \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \"Simple Gallery\\\\n\" into the search bar was successful. The text \"Simple Gallery\" was entered into the search bar, and a list of search results, including \"Simple Gallery0\", \"Simple Gallery1\", \"Simple Gallery2\", etc., is now displayed on the screen. The item \\'Simple Gallery2\\' is highlighted. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully searching for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[230,339],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'Simple Gallery1\\' from the search results. The text \\'Simple Gallery]\\' is detected with bounding box [220, 204, 241, 475], and the tap will be near its center at [230, 339]. The predicted outcome is that the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app will open. If this fails, the next step will be to try a different approach, like manually scrolling through the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'Simple Gallery1\\' (located near [230, 339] in the previous screen) failed to open the Simple Gallery app. Instead, the device returned to the home screen. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal and confirms that launching \\'Simple Gallery\\' from the search results is not a viable approach.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (e.g., from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will open, displaying a list of installed applications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900, 500] to [300, 500] successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications (e.g., Pro Expense, Markor, Files, Clipper, etc.) and a search bar at the top. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the app list accessible for manual searching, which is the current strategy after search-based attempts failed.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the middle of the screen (e.g., from [700, 500] to [300, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. The app drawer is currently displaying the first page of apps. The predicted outcome is that the app list will scroll, revealing more applications, potentially including \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] successfully scrolled the app drawer down. The list of displayed applications changed, revealing apps further down the list (e.g., \\'Clock\\', \\'Contacts\\', \\'Miniwob App\\', \\'Photos\\' are now visible, while \\'Pro Expense\\', \\'AndroidWorld\\' were visible before and are now scrolled off-screen). \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not yet visible. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by continuing the manual search for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Use Simple Gallery to view the receipt. Please enter transactions in csv format including the header \"Date, Item, Amount\".\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[98,440],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Google search bar at the top of the app drawer, located approximately at [98, 440]. The search bar is currently inactive. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will become active, and the virtual keyboard will appear, allowing the agent to type the name of the app to search for (\\'Simple Gallery\\'). Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Google search bar at [98, 440] was successful. The search bar became active, and the virtual keyboard appeared on the screen. The placeholder text \"Search apps, web and more\" is now in the search field. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling the search functionality for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Simple Gallery\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Simple Gallery\\\\n\\' into the focused search bar. The search bar currently contains the placeholder text \"Search apps, web and more\". The predicted outcome is that \\'Simple Gallery\\' will be typed into the search bar, and the search will be initiated, displaying search results for \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \"Simple Gallery\\\\n\" into the search bar was successful. The text \"Simple Gallery\" was entered into the search bar, and a list of search results, including \"Simple Gallery0\", \"Simple Gallery1\", \"Simple Gallery2\", etc., is now displayed on the screen. The item \\'Simple Gallery2\\' is highlighted. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully searching for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[230,339],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'Simple Gallery1\\' from the search results. The text \\'Simple Gallery]\\' is detected with bounding box [220, 204, 241, 475], and the tap will be near its center at [230, 339]. The predicted outcome is that the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app will open. If this fails, the next step will be to try a different approach, like manually scrolling through the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'Simple Gallery1\\' (located near [230, 339] in the previous screen) failed to open the Simple Gallery app. Instead, the device returned to the home screen. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal and confirms that launching \\'Simple Gallery\\' from the search results is not a viable approach.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (e.g., from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will open, displaying a list of installed applications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900, 500] to [300, 500] successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications (e.g., Pro Expense, Markor, Files, Clipper, etc.) and a search bar at the top. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the app list accessible for manual searching, which is the current strategy after search-based attempts failed.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the middle of the screen (e.g., from [700, 500] to [300, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. The app drawer is currently displaying the first page of apps. The predicted outcome is that the app list will scroll, revealing more applications, potentially including \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] successfully scrolled the app drawer down. The list of displayed applications changed, revealing apps further down the list (e.g., \\'Clock\\', \\'Contacts\\', \\'Miniwob App\\', \\'Photos\\' are now visible, while \\'Pro Expense\\', \\'AndroidWorld\\' were visible before and are now scrolled off-screen). \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not yet visible. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by continuing the manual search for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 28: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the middle of the screen (e.g., from [700, 500] to [300, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. The app drawer is currently displaying a page of apps. The predicted outcome is that the app list will scroll, revealing more applications, potentially including \\'Simple Gallery\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Simple Gallery and view receipt.png\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'receipt.png\\' image is displayed full-screen or prominently within the Simple Gallery app.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully opened the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The search bar currently contains the placeholder text \"Search apps, web and more\". The predicted outcome is that \\'Simple Gallery\\' will be typed into the search bar, and the search will be initiated, displaying search results for \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \"Simple Gallery\\\\n\" into the search bar was successful. The text \"Simple Gallery\" was entered into the search bar, and a list of search results, including \"Simple Gallery0\", \"Simple Gallery1\", \"Simple Gallery2\", etc., is now displayed on the screen. The item \\'Simple Gallery2\\' is highlighted. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully searching for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[230,339],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'Simple Gallery1\\' from the search results. The text \\'Simple Gallery]\\' is detected with bounding box [220, 204, 241, 475], and the tap will be near its center at [230, 339]. The predicted outcome is that the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app will open. If this fails, the next step will be to try a different approach, like manually scrolling through the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'Simple Gallery1\\' (located near [230, 339] in the previous screen) failed to open the Simple Gallery app. Instead, the device returned to the home screen. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal and confirms that launching \\'Simple Gallery\\' from the search results is not a viable approach.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (e.g., from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will open, displaying a list of installed applications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900, 500] to [300, 500] successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications (e.g., Pro Expense, Markor, Files, Clipper, etc.) and a search bar at the top. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the app list accessible for manual searching, which is the current strategy after search-based attempts failed.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the middle of the screen (e.g., from [700, 500] to [300, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. The app drawer is currently displaying the first page of apps. The predicted outcome is that the app list will scroll, revealing more applications, potentially including \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] successfully scrolled the app drawer down. The list of displayed applications changed, revealing apps further down the list (e.g., \\'Clock\\', \\'Contacts\\', \\'Miniwob App\\', \\'Photos\\' are now visible, while \\'Pro Expense\\', \\'AndroidWorld\\' were visible before and are now scrolled off-screen). \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not yet visible. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by continuing the manual search for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the middle of the screen (e.g., from [700, 500] to [300, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. The app drawer is currently displaying a page of apps. The predicted outcome is that the app list will scroll, revealing more applications, potentially including \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] successfully scrolled the app drawer down. The list of displayed applications changed, revealing \\'YouTube\\' and \\'YT Music\\' at the bottom. \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not yet visible. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by continuing the manual search for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app, but the app has not been found yet.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The search bar currently contains the placeholder text \"Search apps, web and more\". The predicted outcome is that \\'Simple Gallery\\' will be typed into the search bar, and the search will be initiated, displaying search results for \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \"Simple Gallery\\\\n\" into the search bar was successful. The text \"Simple Gallery\" was entered into the search bar, and a list of search results, including \"Simple Gallery0\", \"Simple Gallery1\", \"Simple Gallery2\", etc., is now displayed on the screen.

The text \\'Simple Gallery]\\' is detected with bounding box [220, 204, 241, 475], and the tap will be near its center at [230, 339].

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Use Simple Gallery to view the receipt. Please enter transactions in csv format including the header \"Date, Item, Amount\".\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[230,339],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'Simple Gallery1\\' from the search results. The text \\'Simple Gallery]\\' is detected with bounding box [220, 204, 241, 475], and the tap will be near its center at [230, 339]. The predicted outcome is that the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app will open. If this fails, the next step will be to try a different approach, like manually scrolling through the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'Simple Gallery1\\' (located near [230, 339] in the previous screen) failed to open the Simple Gallery app. Instead, the device returned to the home screen. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal and confirms that launching \\'Simple Gallery\\' from the search results is not a viable approach.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (e.g., from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will open, displaying a list of installed applications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900, 500] to [300, 500] successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications (e.g., Pro Expense, Markor, Files, Clipper, etc.) and a search bar at the top. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the app list accessible for manual searching, which is the current strategy after search-based attempts failed.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the middle of the screen (e.g., from [700, 500] to [300, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. The app drawer is currently displaying the first page of apps. The predicted outcome is that the app list will scroll, revealing more applications, potentially including \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] successfully scrolled the app drawer down. The list of displayed applications changed, revealing apps further down the list (e.g., \\'Clock\\', \\'Contacts\\', \\'Miniwob App\\', \\'Photos\\' are now visible, while \\'Pro Expense\\', \\'AndroidWorld\\' were visible before and are now scrolled off-screen). \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not yet visible. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by continuing the manual search for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the middle of the screen (e.g., from [700, 500] to [300, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. The app drawer is currently displaying a page of apps. The predicted outcome is that the app list will scroll, revealing more applications, potentially including \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] successfully scrolled the app drawer down. The list of displayed applications changed, revealing \\'YouTube\\' and \\'YT Music\\' at the bottom. \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not yet visible. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by continuing the manual search for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app, but the app has not been found yet.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the middle of the screen (e.g., from [700, 500] to [300, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. The app drawer is currently displaying a page of apps. The predicted outcome is that the app list will scroll, revealing more applications, potentially including \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] had no effect on the screen, as the app drawer was already at the end of its list. \\'Simple Gallery\\' was not found. This action confirms that further scrolling down is not possible and does not bring the agent closer to finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' via scrolling.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 30: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[240,160],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Files\\' app icon. The \\'Files\\' app icon is a blue folder icon located in the second row, first column of the app drawer. The predicted outcome is that the \\'Files\\' app will open, allowing me to search for \\'receipt.png\\'.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The current screen is the home screen. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will open, displaying a list of installed applications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900, 500] to [300, 500] successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications (e.g., Pro Expense, Markor, Files, Clipper, etc.) and a search bar at the top. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the app list accessible for manual searching, which is the current strategy after search-based attempts failed.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the middle of the screen (e.g., from [700, 500] to [300, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. The app drawer is currently displaying the first page of apps. The predicted outcome is that the app list will scroll, revealing more applications, potentially including \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] successfully scrolled the app drawer down. The list of displayed applications changed, revealing apps further down the list (e.g., \\'Clock\\', \\'Contacts\\', \\'Miniwob App\\', \\'Photos\\' are now visible, while \\'Pro Expense\\', \\'AndroidWorld\\' were visible before and are now scrolled off-screen). \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not yet visible. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by continuing the manual search for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the middle of the screen (e.g., from [700, 500] to [300, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. The app drawer is currently displaying a page of apps. The predicted outcome is that the app list will scroll, revealing more applications, potentially including \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] successfully scrolled the app drawer down. The list of displayed applications changed, revealing \\'YouTube\\' and \\'YT Music\\' at the bottom. \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not yet visible. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by continuing the manual search for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app, but the app has not been found yet.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the middle of the screen (e.g., from [700, 500] to [300, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. The app drawer is currently displaying a page of apps. The predicted outcome is that the app list will scroll, revealing more applications, potentially including \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] had no effect on the screen, as the app drawer was already at the end of its list. \\'Simple Gallery\\' was not found. This action confirms that further scrolling down is not possible and does not bring the agent closer to finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' via scrolling.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[240,160],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Files\\' app icon. The \\'Files\\' app icon is a blue folder icon located in the second row, first column of the app drawer. The predicted outcome is that the \\'Files\\' app will open, allowing me to search for \\'receipt.png\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Files\\' app icon (located near [240, 160] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'Files\\' app opened, displaying the \\'Downloads\\' section. The screen changed from the app drawer to the \\'Files\\' app interface. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to find \\'receipt.png\\' within this app.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.56\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 175, 91, 425], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [126, 55, 142, 232], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [177, 149, 197, 272], \\'text\\': \\'Images\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 413, 193, 504], \\'text\\': \\'Audio\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 644, 193, 752], \\'text\\': \\'Videos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 894, 193, 1000], \\'text\\': \\'Docum\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [238, 57, 252, 310], \\'text\\': \\'Files in Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [611, 420, 627, 582], \\'text\\': \\'No items\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [425, 345, 528, 655]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 545, 205, 779]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 313, 205, 533]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 795, 205, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [65, 788, 95, 860]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 864, 94, 973]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [11, 820, 40, 948]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [225, 823, 271, 938]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 195, 38, 242]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [124, 54, 143, 234]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [49, 116, 95, 421]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Use Simple Gallery to view the receipt. Please enter transactions in csv format including the header \"Date, Item, Amount\".\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (e.g., from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. The predicted outcome is that the app drawer will open, displaying a list of installed applications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900, 500] to [300, 500] successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications (e.g., Pro Expense, Markor, Files, Clipper, etc.) and a search bar at the top. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the app list accessible for manual searching, which is the current strategy after search-based attempts failed.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the middle of the screen (e.g., from [700, 500] to [300, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. The app drawer is currently displaying the first page of apps. The predicted outcome is that the app list will scroll, revealing more applications, potentially including \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] successfully scrolled the app drawer down. The list of displayed applications changed, revealing apps further down the list (e.g., \\'Clock\\', \\'Contacts\\', \\'Miniwob App\\', \\'Photos\\' are now visible, while \\'Pro Expense\\', \\'AndroidWorld\\' were visible before and are now scrolled off-screen). \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not yet visible. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by continuing the manual search for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the middle of the screen (e.g., from [700, 500] to [300, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. The app drawer is currently displaying a page of apps. The predicted outcome is that the app list will scroll, revealing more applications, potentially including \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] successfully scrolled the app drawer down. The list of displayed applications changed, revealing \\'YouTube\\' and \\'YT Music\\' at the bottom. \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not yet visible. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by continuing the manual search for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app, but the app has not been found yet.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the middle of the screen (e.g., from [700, 500] to [300, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. The app drawer is currently displaying a page of apps. The predicted outcome is that the app list will scroll, revealing more applications, potentially including \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] had no effect on the screen, as the app drawer was already at the end of its list. \\'Simple Gallery\\' was not found. This action confirms that further scrolling down is not possible and does not bring the agent closer to finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' via scrolling.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[240,160],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Files\\' app icon. The \\'Files\\' app icon is a blue folder icon located in the second row, first column of the app drawer. The predicted outcome is that the \\'Files\\' app will open, allowing me to search for \\'receipt.png\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Files\\' app icon (located near [240, 160] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'Files\\' app opened, displaying the \\'Downloads\\' section. The screen changed from the app drawer to the \\'Files\\' app interface. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to find \\'receipt.png\\' within this app.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 31: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[187,180],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Images\\' tab. The \\'Images\\' tab is located near the top of the screen, to the left of \\'Audio\\'. The predicted outcome is that the view will switch to show only image files in the \\'Downloads\\' folder. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Simple Gallery and view receipt.png\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'receipt.png\\' image is displayed full-screen or prominently within an app, allowing its content to be observed.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully opened the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the middle of the screen (e.g., from [700, 500] to [300, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. The app drawer is currently displaying the first page of apps. The predicted outcome is that the app list will scroll, revealing more applications, potentially including \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] successfully scrolled the app drawer down. The list of displayed applications changed, revealing apps further down the list (e.g., \\'Clock\\', \\'Contacts\\', \\'Miniwob App\\', \\'Photos\\' are now visible, while \\'Pro Expense\\', \\'AndroidWorld\\' were visible before and are now scrolled off-screen). \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not yet visible. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by continuing the manual search for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the middle of the screen (e.g., from [700, 500] to [300, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. The app drawer is currently displaying a page of apps. The predicted outcome is that the app list will scroll, revealing more applications, potentially including \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] successfully scrolled the app drawer down. The list of displayed applications changed, revealing \\'YouTube\\' and \\'YT Music\\' at the bottom. \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not yet visible. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by continuing the manual search for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app, but the app has not been found yet.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the middle of the screen (e.g., from [700, 500] to [300, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. The app drawer is currently displaying a page of apps. The predicted outcome is that the app list will scroll, revealing more applications, potentially including \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] had no effect on the screen, as the app drawer was already at the end of its list. \\'Simple Gallery\\' was not found. This action confirms that further scrolling down is not possible and does not bring the agent closer to finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' via scrolling.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[240,160],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Files\\' app icon. The \\'Files\\' app icon is a blue folder icon located in the second row, first column of the app drawer. The predicted outcome is that the \\'Files\\' app will open, allowing me to search for \\'receipt.png\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Files\\' app icon (located near [240, 160] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'Files\\' app opened, displaying the \\'Downloads\\' section. The screen changed from the app drawer to the \\'Files\\' app interface. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to find \\'receipt.png\\' within this app.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[187,180],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Images\\' tab. The \\'Images\\' tab is located near the top of the screen, to the left of \\'Audio\\'. The predicted outcome is that the view will switch to show only image files in the \\'Downloads\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Images\\' tab at [187,180] was successful. The \\'Files\\' app switched to the \\'Images\\' filter within the \\'Downloads\\' section. This is confirmed by the visual change of the \\'Images\\' tab (now selected with a checkmark and blue background) and the text changing to \\'No matches in Downloads\\'. While the action itself was successful, it did not lead to finding \\'receipt.png\\' in the current view. The agent is still on track to complete the subgoal, but further steps are needed to locate the image. The next step should be to use the search function within the \\'Files\\' app.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.57\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 175, 91, 425], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [126, 57, 142, 232], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [177, 149, 197, 272], \\'text\\': \\'Images\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 413, 193, 504], \\'text\\': \\'Audio\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 644, 193, 752], \\'text\\': \\'Videos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 894, 193, 1000], \\'text\\': \\'Docum\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [238, 57, 252, 310], \\'text\\': \\'Files in Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [610, 272, 627, 730], \\'text\\': \\'No matches in Downloads\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [426, 345, 528, 655]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 546, 205, 781]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 313, 205, 533]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 795, 205, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [65, 788, 95, 861]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 864, 94, 974]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 194, 38, 242]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [225, 824, 270, 938]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [11, 819, 39, 948]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [124, 55, 143, 233]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 29, 38, 188]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [50, 115, 94, 421]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"Search\u2026\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nCreate a file in Markor, called receipt.md with the transactions from the receipt.png. Use Simple Gallery to view the receipt. Please enter transactions in csv format including the header \"Date, Item, Amount\".\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the middle of the screen (e.g., from [700, 500] to [300, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. The app drawer is currently displaying the first page of apps. The predicted outcome is that the app list will scroll, revealing more applications, potentially including \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] successfully scrolled the app drawer down. The list of displayed applications changed, revealing apps further down the list (e.g., \\'Clock\\', \\'Contacts\\', \\'Miniwob App\\', \\'Photos\\' are now visible, while \\'Pro Expense\\', \\'AndroidWorld\\' were visible before and are now scrolled off-screen). \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not yet visible. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by continuing the manual search for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the middle of the screen (e.g., from [700, 500] to [300, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. The app drawer is currently displaying a page of apps. The predicted outcome is that the app list will scroll, revealing more applications, potentially including \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] successfully scrolled the app drawer down. The list of displayed applications changed, revealing \\'YouTube\\' and \\'YT Music\\' at the bottom. \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not yet visible. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by continuing the manual search for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app, but the app has not been found yet.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the middle of the screen (e.g., from [700, 500] to [300, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. The app drawer is currently displaying a page of apps. The predicted outcome is that the app list will scroll, revealing more applications, potentially including \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] had no effect on the screen, as the app drawer was already at the end of its list. \\'Simple Gallery\\' was not found. This action confirms that further scrolling down is not possible and does not bring the agent closer to finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' via scrolling.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[240,160],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Files\\' app icon. The \\'Files\\' app icon is a blue folder icon located in the second row, first column of the app drawer. The predicted outcome is that the \\'Files\\' app will open, allowing me to search for \\'receipt.png\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Files\\' app icon (located near [240, 160] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'Files\\' app opened, displaying the \\'Downloads\\' section. The screen changed from the app drawer to the \\'Files\\' app interface. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to find \\'receipt.png\\' within this app.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[187,180],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Images\\' tab. The \\'Images\\' tab is located near the top of the screen, to the left of \\'Audio\\'. The predicted outcome is that the view will switch to show only image files in the \\'Downloads\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Images\\' tab at [187,180] was successful. The \\'Files\\' app switched to the \\'Images\\' filter within the \\'Downloads\\' section. This is confirmed by the visual change of the \\'Images\\' tab (now selected with a checkmark and blue background) and the text changing to \\'No matches in Downloads\\'. While the action itself was successful, it did not lead to finding \\'receipt.png\\' in the current view. The agent is still on track to complete the subgoal, but further steps are needed to locate the image. The next step should be to use the search function within the \\'Files\\' app.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 32: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,824],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at the top right of the screen. The search icon is currently visible. The predicted outcome is that a search bar will appear, allowing me to input \\'receipt.png\\' to search for the file. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Simple Gallery and view receipt.png\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'receipt.png\\' image is displayed full-screen or prominently within an app, allowing its content to be observed.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully opened the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the middle of the screen (e.g., from [700, 500] to [300, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. The app drawer is currently displaying a page of apps. The predicted outcome is that the app list will scroll, revealing more applications, potentially including \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] successfully scrolled the app drawer down. The list of displayed applications changed, revealing \\'YouTube\\' and \\'YT Music\\' at the bottom. \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not yet visible. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by continuing the manual search for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app, but the app has not been found yet.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the middle of the screen (e.g., from [700, 500] to [300, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. The app drawer is currently displaying a page of apps. The predicted outcome is that the app list will scroll, revealing more applications, potentially including \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] had no effect on the screen, as the app drawer was already at the end of its list. \\'Simple Gallery\\' was not found. This action confirms that further scrolling down is not possible and does not bring the agent closer to finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' via scrolling.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[240,160],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Files\\' app icon. The \\'Files\\' app icon is a blue folder icon located in the second row, first column of the app drawer. The predicted outcome is that the \\'Files\\' app will open, allowing me to search for \\'receipt.png\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Files\\' app icon (located near [240, 160] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'Files\\' app opened, displaying the \\'Downloads\\' section. The screen changed from the app drawer to the \\'Files\\' app interface. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to find \\'receipt.png\\' within this app.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[187,180],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Images\\' tab. The \\'Images\\' tab is located near the top of the screen, to the left of \\'Audio\\'. The predicted outcome is that the view will switch to show only image files in the \\'Downloads\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Images\\' tab at [187,180] was successful. The \\'Files\\' app switched to the \\'Images\\' filter within the \\'Downloads\\' section. This is confirmed by the visual change of the \\'Images\\' tab (now selected with a checkmark and blue background) and the text changing to \\'No matches in Downloads\\'. While the action itself was successful, it did not lead to finding \\'receipt.png\\' in the current view. The agent is still on track to complete the subgoal, but further steps are needed to locate the image. The next step should be to use the search function within the \\'Files\\' app.\\n Step 32: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,824],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at the top right of the screen. The search icon is currently visible. The predicted outcome is that a search bar will appear, allowing me to input \\'receipt.png\\' to search for the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the search icon was successful. A search bar appeared at the top of the screen with the placeholder text \\'Search...\\', and the virtual keyboard became visible. This allows for text input to search for files. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling the search for \\'receipt.png\\'.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.57\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 95, 371], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0 dY: 0.0 ISearch \\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [125, 150, 145, 272], \\'text\\': \\'Images\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [125, 413, 141, 504], \\'text\\': \\'Audio\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [125, 644, 141, 752], \\'text\\': \\'Videos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [126, 894, 141, 1000], \\'text\\': \\'Docum\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [185, 187, 208, 246], \\'text\\': \\'92\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [114, 546, 152, 779]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [114, 313, 152, 532]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [114, 794, 153, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 210, 95, 389]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 194, 38, 241]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [174, 847, 221, 961]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [56, 111, 95, 213]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [12, 819, 40, 904]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [12, 975, 40, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 902, 38, 946]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [1, 538, 74, 677]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"0\", text=\"Search\u2026\", resource-id=\"com.google.android.documentsui:id/search_src_text\", class=\"android.widget.AutoCompleteTextView\", package=\"com.google.android.documentsui\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[210,143][1059,238]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"Search\u2026\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Use Simple Gallery to view the receipt. Please enter transactions in csv format including the header \"Date, Item, Amount\".\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the middle of the screen (e.g., from [700, 500] to [300, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. The app drawer is currently displaying a page of apps. The predicted outcome is that the app list will scroll, revealing more applications, potentially including \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] successfully scrolled the app drawer down. The list of displayed applications changed, revealing \\'YouTube\\' and \\'YT Music\\' at the bottom. \\'Simple Gallery\\' is not yet visible. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by continuing the manual search for the \\'Simple Gallery\\' app, but the app has not been found yet.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the middle of the screen (e.g., from [700, 500] to [300, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. The app drawer is currently displaying a page of apps. The predicted outcome is that the app list will scroll, revealing more applications, potentially including \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] had no effect on the screen, as the app drawer was already at the end of its list. \\'Simple Gallery\\' was not found. This action confirms that further scrolling down is not possible and does not bring the agent closer to finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' via scrolling.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[240,160],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Files\\' app icon. The \\'Files\\' app icon is a blue folder icon located in the second row, first column of the app drawer. The predicted outcome is that the \\'Files\\' app will open, allowing me to search for \\'receipt.png\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Files\\' app icon (located near [240, 160] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'Files\\' app opened, displaying the \\'Downloads\\' section. The screen changed from the app drawer to the \\'Files\\' app interface. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to find \\'receipt.png\\' within this app.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[187,180],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Images\\' tab. The \\'Images\\' tab is located near the top of the screen, to the left of \\'Audio\\'. The predicted outcome is that the view will switch to show only image files in the \\'Downloads\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Images\\' tab at [187,180] was successful. The \\'Files\\' app switched to the \\'Images\\' filter within the \\'Downloads\\' section. This is confirmed by the visual change of the \\'Images\\' tab (now selected with a checkmark and blue background) and the text changing to \\'No matches in Downloads\\'. While the action itself was successful, it did not lead to finding \\'receipt.png\\' in the current view. The agent is still on track to complete the subgoal, but further steps are needed to locate the image. The next step should be to use the search function within the \\'Files\\' app.\\n Step 32: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,824],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at the top right of the screen. The search icon is currently visible. The predicted outcome is that a search bar will appear, allowing me to input \\'receipt.png\\' to search for the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the search icon was successful. A search bar appeared at the top of the screen with the placeholder text \\'Search...\\', and the virtual keyboard became visible. This allows for text input to search for files. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling the search for \\'receipt.png\\'.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 33: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"receipt.png\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'receipt.png\\' into the currently focused search bar. The search bar currently displays \\'Search...\\'. After this action, the search bar should contain \\'receipt.png\\', and search results might appear. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Simple Gallery and view receipt.png\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'receipt.png\\' image is displayed full-screen or prominently within an app, allowing its content to be observed.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully opened the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the middle of the screen (e.g., from [700, 500] to [300, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. The app drawer is currently displaying a page of apps. The predicted outcome is that the app list will scroll, revealing more applications, potentially including \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] had no effect on the screen, as the app drawer was already at the end of its list. \\'Simple Gallery\\' was not found. This action confirms that further scrolling down is not possible and does not bring the agent closer to finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' via scrolling.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[240,160],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Files\\' app icon. The \\'Files\\' app icon is a blue folder icon located in the second row, first column of the app drawer. The predicted outcome is that the \\'Files\\' app will open, allowing me to search for \\'receipt.png\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Files\\' app icon (located near [240, 160] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'Files\\' app opened, displaying the \\'Downloads\\' section. The screen changed from the app drawer to the \\'Files\\' app interface. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to find \\'receipt.png\\' within this app.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[187,180],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Images\\' tab. The \\'Images\\' tab is located near the top of the screen, to the left of \\'Audio\\'. The predicted outcome is that the view will switch to show only image files in the \\'Downloads\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Images\\' tab at [187,180] was successful. The \\'Files\\' app switched to the \\'Images\\' filter within the \\'Downloads\\' section. This is confirmed by the visual change of the \\'Images\\' tab (now selected with a checkmark and blue background) and the text changing to \\'No matches in Downloads\\'. While the action itself was successful, it did not lead to finding \\'receipt.png\\' in the current view. The agent is still on track to complete the subgoal, but further steps are needed to locate the image. The next step should be to use the search function within the \\'Files\\' app.\\n Step 32: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,824],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at the top right of the screen. The search icon is currently visible. The predicted outcome is that a search bar will appear, allowing me to input \\'receipt.png\\' to search for the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the search icon was successful. A search bar appeared at the top of the screen with the placeholder text \\'Search...\\', and the virtual keyboard became visible. This allows for text input to search for files. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling the search for \\'receipt.png\\'.\\n Step 33: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"receipt.png\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'receipt.png\\' into the currently focused search bar. The search bar currently displays \\'Search...\\'. After this action, the search bar should contain \\'receipt.png\\', and search results might appear. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'receipt.png\\' into the search bar was successful. The text \\'receipt.png\\' now appears in the search bar. However, the search yielded \\'No matches in Downloads\\', meaning the file was not found in the \\'Downloads\\' folder with the \\'Images\\' filter applied. This action did not directly bring the agent closer to viewing the image, as the image was not found. The agent needs to adjust its strategy to locate the file.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 43, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15:58\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 209, 96, 437], \\'text\\': \\'receipt.png\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [124, 149, 145, 272], \\'text\\': \\'Images\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [125, 413, 141, 504], \\'text\\': \\'Audio\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [125, 644, 141, 752], \\'text\\': \\'Videos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [126, 894, 141, 1000], \\'text\\': \\'Docum\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [186, 57, 200, 310], \\'text\\': \\'Files in Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [558, 272, 575, 730], \\'text\\': \\'No matches in Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [373, 345, 476, 655]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [115, 546, 152, 781]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [115, 313, 152, 532]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [115, 56, 152, 298]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [114, 795, 152, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 209, 94, 434]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 193, 37, 241]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 40, 37, 189]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [12, 818, 39, 948]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [13, 976, 40, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [179, 843, 206, 922]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"0\", text=\"receipt.png\", resource-id=\"com.google.android.documentsui:id/search_src_text\", class=\"android.widget.AutoCompleteTextView\", package=\"com.google.android.documentsui\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[210,143][932,238]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"receipt.png\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"receipt.png\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### Screen Information Text After the Action ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

Use Simple Gallery to view the receipt. Please enter transactions in csv format including the header \"Date, Item, Amount\".\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the middle of the screen (e.g., from [700, 500] to [300, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. The app drawer is currently displaying a page of apps. The predicted outcome is that the app list will scroll, revealing more applications, potentially including \\'Simple Gallery\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] had no effect on the screen, as the app drawer was already at the end of its list. \\'Simple Gallery\\' was not found. This action confirms that further scrolling down is not possible and does not bring the agent closer to finding \\'Simple Gallery\\' via scrolling.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[240,160],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Files\\' app icon. The \\'Files\\' app icon is a blue folder icon located in the second row, first column of the app drawer. The predicted outcome is that the \\'Files\\' app will open, allowing me to search for \\'receipt.png\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Files\\' app icon (located near [240, 160] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'Files\\' app opened, displaying the \\'Downloads\\' section. The screen changed from the app drawer to the \\'Files\\' app interface. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to find \\'receipt.png\\' within this app.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[187,180],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Images\\' tab. The \\'Images\\' tab is located near the top of the screen, to the left of \\'Audio\\'. The predicted outcome is that the view will switch to show only image files in the \\'Downloads\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Images\\' tab at [187,180] was successful. The \\'Files\\' app switched to the \\'Images\\' filter within the \\'Downloads\\' section. This is confirmed by the visual change of the \\'Images\\' tab (now selected with a checkmark and blue background) and the text changing to \\'No matches in Downloads\\'. While the action itself was successful, it did not lead to finding \\'receipt.png\\' in the current view. The agent is still on track to complete the subgoal, but further steps are needed to locate the image. The next step should be to use the search function within the \\'Files\\' app.\\n Step 32: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,824],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at the top right of the screen. The search icon is currently visible. The predicted outcome is that a search bar will appear, allowing me to input \\'receipt.png\\' to search for the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the search icon was successful. A search bar appeared at the top of the screen with the placeholder text \\'Search...\\', and the virtual keyboard became visible. This allows for text input to search for files. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling the search for \\'receipt.png\\'.\\n Step 33: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"receipt.png\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'receipt.png\\' into the currently focused search bar. The search bar currently displays \\'Search...\\'. After this action, the search bar should contain \\'receipt.png\\', and search results might appear. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'receipt.png\\' into the search bar was successful. The text \\'receipt.png\\' now appears in the search bar. However, the search yielded \\'No matches in Downloads\\', meaning the file was not found in the \\'Downloads\\' folder with the \\'Images\\' filter applied. This action did not directly bring the agent closer to viewing the image, as the image was not found. The agent needs to adjust its strategy to locate the file.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 34: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,80],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon at the top-left of the screen (estimated at [80, 80]). The back arrow is currently visible. The predicted outcome is that the app will navigate back from the search results page, likely returning to the \\'Images\\' view within \\'Downloads\\' or a more general view within the \\'Files\\' app, allowing for a new search or navigation strategy. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Simple Gallery and view receipt.png\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'receipt.png\\' image is displayed full-screen or prominently within an app, allowing its content to be observed.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully opened the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[240,160],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Files\\' app icon. The \\'Files\\' app icon is a blue folder icon located in the second row, first column of the app drawer. The predicted outcome is that the \\'Files\\' app will open, allowing me to search for \\'receipt.png\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Files\\' app icon (located near [240, 160] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'Files\\' app opened, displaying the \\'Downloads\\' section. The screen changed from the app drawer to the \\'Files\\' app interface. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to find \\'receipt.png\\' within this app.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[187,180],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Images\\' tab. The \\'Images\\' tab is located near the top of the screen, to the left of \\'Audio\\'. The predicted outcome is that the view will switch to show only image files in the \\'Downloads\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Images\\' tab at [187,180] was successful. The \\'Files\\' app switched to the \\'Images\\' filter within the \\'Downloads\\' section. This is confirmed by the visual change of the \\'Images\\' tab (now selected with a checkmark and blue background) and the text changing to \\'No matches in Downloads\\'. While the action itself was successful, it did not lead to finding \\'receipt.png\\' in the current view. The agent is still on track to complete the subgoal, but further steps are needed to locate the image. The next step should be to use the search function within the \\'Files\\' app.\\n Step 32: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,824],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at the top right of the screen. The search icon is currently visible. The predicted outcome is that a search bar will appear, allowing me to input \\'receipt.png\\' to search for the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the search icon was successful. A search bar appeared at the top of the screen with the placeholder text \\'Search...\\', and the virtual keyboard became visible. This allows for text input to search for files. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling the search for \\'receipt.png\\'.\\n Step 33: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"receipt.png\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'receipt.png\\' into the currently focused search bar. The search bar currently displays \\'Search...\\'. After this action, the search bar should contain \\'receipt.png\\', and search results might appear. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'receipt.png\\' into the search bar was successful. The text \\'receipt.png\\' now appears in the search bar. However, the search yielded \\'No matches in Downloads\\', meaning the file was not found in the \\'Downloads\\' folder with the \\'Images\\' filter applied. This action did not directly bring the agent closer to viewing the image, as the image was not found. The agent needs to adjust its strategy to locate the file.\\n Step 34: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,80],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon at the top-left of the screen (estimated at [80, 80]). The back arrow is currently visible. The predicted outcome is that the app will navigate back from the search results page, likely returning to the \\'Images\\' view within \\'Downloads\\' or a more general view within the \\'Files\\' app, allowing for a new search or navigation strategy. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon was successful. The \\'Files\\' app navigated away from the search results page and the \\'Images\\' filter. The screen now displays the \\'Downloads\\' folder with the message \\'No items\\'. The search bar has disappeared. This action allows for a new search attempt in a broader context (Downloads folder without filters), bringing the agent closer to potentially finding the file if it exists in this location.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15:59\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 175, 91, 425], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [126, 57, 142, 232], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [177, 149, 197, 272], \\'text\\': \\'Images\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 413, 193, 504], \\'text\\': \\'Audio\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 644, 193, 752], \\'text\\': \\'Videos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 894, 193, 1000], \\'text\\': \\'Docum\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [238, 57, 252, 310], \\'text\\': \\'Files in Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [611, 420, 627, 582], \\'text\\': \\'No items\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [425, 345, 528, 655]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 545, 205, 779]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 313, 205, 533]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 795, 205, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [65, 788, 95, 860]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 864, 94, 973]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [11, 820, 40, 948]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [225, 823, 271, 938]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 195, 38, 242]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [124, 54, 143, 234]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [49, 115, 95, 421]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",
