Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 253], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: -372.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [54, 284, 66, 537], \\'text\\': \\'IdY:-1663.9 Xv: -5.744\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: -17.152 Prs: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 65, 948], \\'text\\': \\'Size: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [123, 46, 147, 306], \\'text\\': \\'Sun; Oct 15\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 336, 722, 431], \\'text\\': \\'Gmail\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 561, 722, 676], \\'text\\': \\'Photos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [704, 781, 722, 921], \\'text\\': \\'YouTube\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [775, 295, 872, 709], \\'text\\': \\'0 (9\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 72, 855, 232]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [788, 764, 856, 929]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 534, 858, 707]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 298, 856, 466]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 535, 731, 696]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [628, 297, 732, 464]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 760, 730, 930]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [900, 701, 947, 795]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [893, 803, 952, 916]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 823, 38, 900]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is intended to reveal the list of all installed applications, where the \\'pro expense\\' app can be found. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications and a search bar at the top. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'pro expense\\' app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[100,450],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Google search bar at the top of the app drawer, located approximately at [100, 450]. This action is intended to activate the search functionality, allowing me to type the name of the \\'pro expense\\' app. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [100, 450] was intended to activate the search bar in the app drawer. However, the action did not result in any visible change to the search bar\\'s state (e.g., no cursor appeared, no keyboard opened). The app drawer remains on the screen, displaying the list of apps and the inactive search bar. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'pro expense\\' app. The failure might be due to the tap not registering correctly or the specific tap location not being optimal, despite being within the visual area of the search bar. The next step should be to attempt tapping the search bar again.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 2: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[100,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Google search bar at the top of the app drawer, located approximately at [100, 500].

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5.

This action is intended to reveal the list of all installed applications, where the \\'pro expense\\' app can be found. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications and a search bar at the top. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'pro expense\\' app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[100,450],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Google search bar at the top of the app drawer, located approximately at [100, 450]. This action is intended to activate the search functionality, allowing me to type the name of the \\'pro expense\\' app. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [100, 450] was intended to activate the search bar in the app drawer. However, the action did not result in any visible change to the search bar\\'s state (e.g., no cursor appeared, no keyboard opened). The app drawer remains on the screen, displaying the list of apps and the inactive search bar. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'pro expense\\' app. The failure might be due to the tap not registering correctly or the specific tap location not being optimal, despite being within the visual area of the search bar. The next step should be to attempt tapping the search bar again.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[100,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Google search bar at the top of the app drawer, located approximately at [100, 500]. This action is intended to activate the search functionality, allowing me to type the name of the \\'pro expense\\' app. The search bar is currently inactive. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [100, 500] successfully activated the search bar in the app drawer. The search bar now displays \"Search apps, web and more\" and is focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'pro expense\\' app. The next step is to input the app name into the search field.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.36\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [84, 194, 112, 804], \\'text\\': \\'Search apps; web and more\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [228, 94, 244, 236], \\'text\\': \\'YouTube\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [224, 317, 249, 459], \\'text\\': \\'Settings\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [229, 557, 244, 671], \\'text\\': \\'Photos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [228, 788, 244, 882], \\'text\\': \\'Clock\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [419, 208, 433, 231], \\'text\\': \\'2\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [147, 526, 251, 706]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [149, 302, 250, 479]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [149, 745, 251, 933]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [147, 84, 251, 255]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [409, 91, 445, 169]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [287, 93, 323, 169]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [347, 91, 386, 171]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [80, 856, 113, 912]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [334, 57, 397, 951]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [409, 185, 445, 252]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"2\", text=\"Search apps, web and more\", resource-id=\"com.google.android.apps.nexuslauncher:id/input\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"com.google.android.apps.nexuslauncher\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[214,156][886,301]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"Search apps, web and more\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

This action is intended to reveal the list of all installed applications, where the \\'pro expense\\' app can be found. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications and a search bar at the top. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'pro expense\\' app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[100,450],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Google search bar at the top of the app drawer, located approximately at [100, 450]. This action is intended to activate the search functionality, allowing me to type the name of the \\'pro expense\\' app. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [100, 450] was intended to activate the search bar in the app drawer. However, the action did not result in any visible change to the search bar\\'s state (e.g., no cursor appeared, no keyboard opened). The app drawer remains on the screen, displaying the list of apps and the inactive search bar. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'pro expense\\' app. The failure might be due to the tap not registering correctly or the specific tap location not being optimal, despite being within the visual area of the search bar. The next step should be to attempt tapping the search bar again.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[100,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Google search bar at the top of the app drawer, located approximately at [100, 500]. This action is intended to activate the search functionality, allowing me to type the name of the \\'pro expense\\' app. The search bar is currently inactive. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [100, 500] successfully activated the search bar in the app drawer. The search bar now displays \"Search apps, web and more\" and is focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'pro expense\\' app. The next step is to input the app name into the search field.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 3: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"pro expense\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'pro expense\\' into the search field. The search field currently displays \\'Search apps, web and more\\' and is focused. After this action, the search field should contain \\'pro expense\\', and search results for the app should appear. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open \\'pro expense\\' App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'pro expense\\' app is open and its main screen is visible.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 4 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (from [900, 500] to [200, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is intended to reveal the list of all installed applications, where the \\'pro expense\\' app can be found. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications and a search bar at the top. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'pro expense\\' app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[100,450],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Google search bar at the top of the app drawer, located approximately at [100, 450]. This action is intended to activate the search functionality, allowing me to type the name of the \\'pro expense\\' app. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [100, 450] was intended to activate the search bar in the app drawer. However, the action did not result in any visible change to the search bar\\'s state (e.g., no cursor appeared, no keyboard opened). The app drawer remains on the screen, displaying the list of apps and the inactive search bar. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'pro expense\\' app. The failure might be due to the tap not registering correctly or the specific tap location not being optimal, despite being within the visual area of the search bar. The next step should be to attempt tapping the search bar again.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[100,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Google search bar at the top of the app drawer, located approximately at [100, 500]. This action is intended to activate the search functionality, allowing me to type the name of the \\'pro expense\\' app. The search bar is currently inactive. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [100, 500] successfully activated the search bar in the app drawer. The search bar now displays \"Search apps, web and more\" and is focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'pro expense\\' app. The next step is to input the app name into the search field.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"pro expense\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'pro expense\\' into the search field. The search field currently displays \\'Search apps, web and more\\' and is focused. After this action, the search field should contain \\'pro expense\\', and search results for the app should appear. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'pro expense\\' into the search field was successful. The search bar now correctly displays \\'pro expense\\'. As a result, the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon and name appeared as the primary search result, directly below the search bar. This action has brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'pro expense\\' app. The next step is to tap on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app to launch it.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.36\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [81, 193, 113, 475], \\'text\\': \\'pro expense\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [228, 69, 249, 264], \\'text\\': \\'Pro Expense\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [294, 204, 317, 447], \\'text\\': \\'pro expenseo\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [355, 204, 377, 442], \\'text\\': \\'pro expense1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [416, 203, 440, 448], \\'text\\': \\'pro expense2\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [274, 53, 335, 950]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [334, 51, 398, 952]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [398, 50, 457, 951]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [77, 69, 121, 495]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"2\", text=\"pro expense\", resource-id=\"com.google.android.apps.nexuslauncher:id/input\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"com.google.android.apps.nexuslauncher\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[214,156][886,301]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"pro expense\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is intended to reveal the list of all installed applications, where the \\'pro expense\\' app can be found. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications and a search bar at the top. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'pro expense\\' app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[100,450],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Google search bar at the top of the app drawer, located approximately at [100, 450]. This action is intended to activate the search functionality, allowing me to type the name of the \\'pro expense\\' app. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [100, 450] was intended to activate the search bar in the app drawer. However, the action did not result in any visible change to the search bar\\'s state (e.g., no cursor appeared, no keyboard opened). The app drawer remains on the screen, displaying the list of apps and the inactive search bar. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'pro expense\\' app. The failure might be due to the tap not registering correctly or the specific tap location not being optimal, despite being within the visual area of the search bar. The next step should be to attempt tapping the search bar again.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[100,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Google search bar at the top of the app drawer, located approximately at [100, 500]. This action is intended to activate the search functionality, allowing me to type the name of the \\'pro expense\\' app. The search bar is currently inactive. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [100, 500] successfully activated the search bar in the app drawer. The search bar now displays \"Search apps, web and more\" and is focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'pro expense\\' app. The next step is to input the app name into the search field.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"pro expense\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'pro expense\\' into the search field. The search field currently displays \\'Search apps, web and more\\' and is focused. After this action, the search field should contain \\'pro expense\\', and search results for the app should appear. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'pro expense\\' into the search field was successful. The search bar now correctly displays \\'pro expense\\'. As a result, the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon and name appeared as the primary search result, directly below the search bar. This action has brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'pro expense\\' app. The next step is to tap on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app to launch it.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 4: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[238,166],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'Pro Expense\\' (located at approximately [238, 166]) to launch the \\'Pro Expense\\' application. The app is currently listed as a search result. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open \\'pro expense\\' App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'pro expense\\' app is open and its main screen is visible.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is intended to reveal the list of all installed applications, where the \\'pro expense\\' app can be found. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications and a search bar at the top. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'pro expense\\' app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[100,450],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Google search bar at the top of the app drawer, located approximately at [100, 450]. This action is intended to activate the search functionality, allowing me to type the name of the \\'pro expense\\' app. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [100, 450] was intended to activate the search bar in the app drawer. However, the action did not result in any visible change to the search bar\\'s state (e.g., no cursor appeared, no keyboard opened). The app drawer remains on the screen, displaying the list of apps and the inactive search bar. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'pro expense\\' app. The failure might be due to the tap not registering correctly or the specific tap location not being optimal, despite being within the visual area of the search bar. The next step should be to attempt tapping the search bar again.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[100,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Google search bar at the top of the app drawer, located approximately at [100, 500]. This action is intended to activate the search functionality, allowing me to type the name of the \\'pro expense\\' app. The search bar is currently inactive. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [100, 500] successfully activated the search bar in the app drawer. The search bar now displays \"Search apps, web and more\" and is focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'pro expense\\' app. The next step is to input the app name into the search field.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"pro expense\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'pro expense\\' into the search field. The search field currently displays \\'Search apps, web and more\\' and is focused. After this action, the search field should contain \\'pro expense\\', and search results for the app should appear. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'pro expense\\' into the search field was successful. The search bar now correctly displays \\'pro expense\\'. As a result, the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon and name appeared as the primary search result, directly below the search bar. This action has brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'pro expense\\' app. The next step is to tap on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app to launch it.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[238,166],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'Pro Expense\\' (located at approximately [238, 166]) to launch the \\'Pro Expense\\' application. The app is currently listed as a search result. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon ([238, 166]) in the search results was successful. The \\'Pro Expense\\' app launched, and its home screen is now visible, as shown in the second screenshot. This completes the first subgoal. The app\\'s home screen shows financial summaries and a \\'+\\' button, which is the next target for interaction to add an expense.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is intended to reveal the list of all installed applications, where the \\'pro expense\\' app can be found. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications and a search bar at the top. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'pro expense\\' app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[100,450],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Google search bar at the top of the app drawer, located approximately at [100, 450]. This action is intended to activate the search functionality, allowing me to type the name of the \\'pro expense\\' app. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [100, 450] was intended to activate the search bar in the app drawer. However, the action did not result in any visible change to the search bar\\'s state (e.g., no cursor appeared, no keyboard opened). The app drawer remains on the screen, displaying the list of apps and the inactive search bar. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'pro expense\\' app. The failure might be due to the tap not registering correctly or the specific tap location not being optimal, despite being within the visual area of the search bar. The next step should be to attempt tapping the search bar again.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[100,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Google search bar at the top of the app drawer, located approximately at [100, 500]. This action is intended to activate the search functionality, allowing me to type the name of the \\'pro expense\\' app. The search bar is currently inactive. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [100, 500] successfully activated the search bar in the app drawer. The search bar now displays \"Search apps, web and more\" and is focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'pro expense\\' app. The next step is to input the app name into the search field.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"pro expense\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'pro expense\\' into the search field. The search field currently displays \\'Search apps, web and more\\' and is focused. After this action, the search field should contain \\'pro expense\\', and search results for the app should appear. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'pro expense\\' into the search field was successful. The search bar now correctly displays \\'pro expense\\'. As a result, the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon and name appeared as the primary search result, directly below the search bar. This action has brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'pro expense\\' app. The next step is to tap on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app to launch it.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[238,166],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'Pro Expense\\' (located at approximately [238, 166]) to launch the \\'Pro Expense\\' application. The app is currently listed as a search result. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon ([238, 166]) in the search results was successful. The \\'Pro Expense\\' app launched, and its home screen is now visible, as shown in the second screenshot. This completes the first subgoal. The app\\'s home screen shows financial summaries and a \\'+\\' button, which is the next target for interaction to add an expense.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 5: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[909,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'+\\' button located at the bottom right of the screen (approximately at [909, 893]) to initiate the process of adding a new expense. The button is a blue circle with a white plus sign. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open \\'pro expense\\' App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'pro expense\\' app is open and its main screen is visible.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[100,450],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Google search bar at the top of the app drawer, located approximately at [100, 450]. This action is intended to activate the search functionality, allowing me to type the name of the \\'pro expense\\' app. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [100, 450] was intended to activate the search bar in the app drawer. However, the action did not result in any visible change to the search bar\\'s state (e.g., no cursor appeared, no keyboard opened). The app drawer remains on the screen, displaying the list of apps and the inactive search bar. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'pro expense\\' app. The failure might be due to the tap not registering correctly or the specific tap location not being optimal, despite being within the visual area of the search bar. The next step should be to attempt tapping the search bar again.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[100,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Google search bar at the top of the app drawer, located approximately at [100, 500]. This action is intended to activate the search functionality, allowing me to type the name of the \\'pro expense\\' app. The search bar is currently inactive. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [100, 500] successfully activated the search bar in the app drawer. The search bar now displays \"Search apps, web and more\" and is focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'pro expense\\' app. The next step is to input the app name into the search field.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"pro expense\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'pro expense\\' into the search field. The search field currently displays \\'Search apps, web and more\\' and is focused. After this action, the search field should contain \\'pro expense\\', and search results for the app should appear. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'pro expense\\' into the search field was successful. The search bar now correctly displays \\'pro expense\\'. As a result, the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon and name appeared as the primary search result, directly below the search bar. This action has brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'pro expense\\' app. The next step is to tap on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app to launch it.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[238,166],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'Pro Expense\\' (located at approximately [238, 166]) to launch the \\'Pro Expense\\' application. The app is currently listed as a search result. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon ([238, 166]) in the search results was successful. The \\'Pro Expense\\' app launched, and its home screen is now visible, as shown in the second screenshot. This completes the first subgoal. The app\\'s home screen shows financial summaries and a \\'+\\' button, which is the next target for interaction to add an expense.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[909,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'+\\' button located at the bottom right of the screen (approximately at [909, 893]) to initiate the process of adding a new expense. The button is a blue circle with a white plus sign. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'+\\' button at [909, 893] was successful. The app transitioned from its home screen to the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen. This new screen provides the necessary interface elements (text fields for Name, Amount, Note, category buttons, and a SAVE button) to add a new expense. This action directly advances the progress towards completing the active subgoal of adding the first expense.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.37\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 107, 519], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0 IdY: 0.0 JXv: 0.0 Expense Entry 15 Oct 2023 3.37 PM\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [144, 88, 156, 164], \\'text\\': \\'Name\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [258, 88, 274, 250], \\'text\\': \\'Amount\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [327, 85, 344, 175], \\'text\\': \\'Food\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [328, 225, 344, 358], \\'text\\': \\'Income\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [323, 405, 349, 712], \\'text\\': \\'Housing Social\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [325, 763, 345, 987], \\'text\\': \\'Entertainmel\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [412, 87, 428, 171], \\'text\\': \\'Note\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [533, 372, 549, 471], \\'text\\': \\'SAVE\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [389, 55, 496, 947]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [518, 49, 567, 793]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [315, 390, 362, 571]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [315, 207, 362, 377]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [315, 584, 362, 731]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [315, 745, 363, 990]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [516, 816, 566, 947]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 820, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 195, 37, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 899, 101, 985]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 141, 36, 188]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 783, 112, 869]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 905, 36, 944]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"Name\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nAdd the following expenses into the pro expense:\\nExpense: Social Club Dues\\n amount_dollars: $67.41\\n category_name: Social\\n note: Monthly recurring\\n\\nExpense: Legal Fees\\n amount_dollars: $10.14\\n category_name: Others\\n note: Monthly recurring\\n\\nExpense: Stationery\\n amount_dollars: $118.93\\n category_name: Others\\n note: Remember to transfer funds\\n\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[100,450],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Google search bar at the top of the app drawer, located approximately at [100, 450]. This action is intended to activate the search functionality, allowing me to type the name of the \\'pro expense\\' app. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [100, 450] was intended to activate the search bar in the app drawer. However, the action did not result in any visible change to the search bar\\'s state (e.g., no cursor appeared, no keyboard opened). The app drawer remains on the screen, displaying the list of apps and the inactive search bar. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'pro expense\\' app. The failure might be due to the tap not registering correctly or the specific tap location not being optimal, despite being within the visual area of the search bar. The next step should be to attempt tapping the search bar again.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[100,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Google search bar at the top of the app drawer, located approximately at [100, 500]. This action is intended to activate the search functionality, allowing me to type the name of the \\'pro expense\\' app. The search bar is currently inactive. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [100, 500] successfully activated the search bar in the app drawer. The search bar now displays \"Search apps, web and more\" and is focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'pro expense\\' app. The next step is to input the app name into the search field.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"pro expense\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'pro expense\\' into the search field. The search field currently displays \\'Search apps, web and more\\' and is focused. After this action, the search field should contain \\'pro expense\\', and search results for the app should appear. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'pro expense\\' into the search field was successful. The search bar now correctly displays \\'pro expense\\'. As a result, the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon and name appeared as the primary search result, directly below the search bar. This action has brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'pro expense\\' app. The next step is to tap on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app to launch it.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[238,166],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'Pro Expense\\' (located at approximately [238, 166]) to launch the \\'Pro Expense\\' application. The app is currently listed as a search result. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon ([238, 166]) in the search results was successful. The \\'Pro Expense\\' app launched, and its home screen is now visible, as shown in the second screenshot. This completes the first subgoal. The app\\'s home screen shows financial summaries and a \\'+\\' button, which is the next target for interaction to add an expense.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[909,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'+\\' button located at the bottom right of the screen (approximately at [909, 893]) to initiate the process of adding a new expense. The button is a blue circle with a white plus sign. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'+\\' button at [909, 893] was successful. The app transitioned from its home screen to the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen. This new screen provides the necessary interface elements (text fields for Name, Amount, Note, category buttons, and a SAVE button) to add a new expense. This action directly advances the progress towards completing the active subgoal of adding the first expense.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 6: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[180,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' text field, which is currently empty. This action should focus the text field and bring up the keyboard, allowing text input for the expense name. The text field is located approximately at [180, 500]. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open \\'pro expense\\' App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'pro expense\\' app is open and its main screen is visible.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[100,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Google search bar at the top of the app drawer, located approximately at [100, 500]. This action is intended to activate the search functionality, allowing me to type the name of the \\'pro expense\\' app. The search bar is currently inactive. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [100, 500] successfully activated the search bar in the app drawer. The search bar now displays \"Search apps, web and more\" and is focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'pro expense\\' app. The next step is to input the app name into the search field.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"pro expense\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'pro expense\\' into the search field. The search field currently displays \\'Search apps, web and more\\' and is focused. After this action, the search field should contain \\'pro expense\\', and search results for the app should appear. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'pro expense\\' into the search field was successful. The search bar now correctly displays \\'pro expense\\'. As a result, the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon and name appeared as the primary search result, directly below the search bar. This action has brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'pro expense\\' app. The next step is to tap on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app to launch it.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[238,166],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'Pro Expense\\' (located at approximately [238, 166]) to launch the \\'Pro Expense\\' application. The app is currently listed as a search result. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon ([238, 166]) in the search results was successful. The \\'Pro Expense\\' app launched, and its home screen is now visible, as shown in the second screenshot. This completes the first subgoal. The app\\'s home screen shows financial summaries and a \\'+\\' button, which is the next target for interaction to add an expense.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[909,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'+\\' button located at the bottom right of the screen (approximately at [909, 893]) to initiate the process of adding a new expense. The button is a blue circle with a white plus sign. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'+\\' button at [909, 893] was successful. The app transitioned from its home screen to the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen. This new screen provides the necessary interface elements (text fields for Name, Amount, Note, category buttons, and a SAVE button) to add a new expense. This action directly advances the progress towards completing the active subgoal of adding the first expense.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[180,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' text field, which is currently empty. This action should focus the text field and bring up the keyboard, allowing text input for the expense name. The text field is located approximately at [180, 500]. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Name\\' text field was successful. The \\'Name\\' text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard is active, as indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' at the bottom of the screen and confirmed by the post-action screen information. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Social Club Dues\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'Social Club Dues\\' into this field.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.38\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 107, 519], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0 IdY: 0.0 JXv: 0.0 Expense Entry 15 Oct 2023 3.37 PM\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [144, 88, 156, 164], \\'text\\': \\'Name\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [258, 88, 274, 250], \\'text\\': \\'Amount\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [327, 85, 344, 175], \\'text\\': \\'Food\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [328, 225, 344, 358], \\'text\\': \\'Income\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [323, 405, 349, 712], \\'text\\': \\'Housing Social\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [325, 763, 345, 987], \\'text\\': \\'Entertainmel\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [412, 87, 428, 171], \\'text\\': \\'Note\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [533, 372, 549, 471], \\'text\\': \\'SAVE\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [389, 55, 496, 947]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [518, 49, 567, 793]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [315, 390, 362, 571]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [315, 207, 362, 377]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [315, 584, 362, 731]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [315, 745, 363, 990]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [516, 816, 566, 947]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 819, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 897, 101, 985]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 782, 112, 870]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 196, 37, 241]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 141, 36, 188]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 904, 36, 945]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"1\", text=\"Name\", resource-id=\"com.arduia.expense:id/edt_name\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"com.arduia.expense\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[63,352][1017,504]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"Name\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[100,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Google search bar at the top of the app drawer, located approximately at [100, 500]. This action is intended to activate the search functionality, allowing me to type the name of the \\'pro expense\\' app. The search bar is currently inactive. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [100, 500] successfully activated the search bar in the app drawer. The search bar now displays \"Search apps, web and more\" and is focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'pro expense\\' app. The next step is to input the app name into the search field.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"pro expense\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'pro expense\\' into the search field. The search field currently displays \\'Search apps, web and more\\' and is focused. After this action, the search field should contain \\'pro expense\\', and search results for the app should appear. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'pro expense\\' into the search field was successful. The search bar now correctly displays \\'pro expense\\'. As a result, the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon and name appeared as the primary search result, directly below the search bar. This action has brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'pro expense\\' app. The next step is to tap on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app to launch it.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[238,166],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'Pro Expense\\' (located at approximately [238, 166]) to launch the \\'Pro Expense\\' application. The app is currently listed as a search result. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon ([238, 166]) in the search results was successful. The \\'Pro Expense\\' app launched, and its home screen is now visible, as shown in the second screenshot. This completes the first subgoal. The app\\'s home screen shows financial summaries and a \\'+\\' button, which is the next target for interaction to add an expense.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[909,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'+\\' button located at the bottom right of the screen (approximately at [909, 893]) to initiate the process of adding a new expense. The button is a blue circle with a white plus sign. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'+\\' button at [909, 893] was successful. The app transitioned from its home screen to the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen. This new screen provides the necessary interface elements (text fields for Name, Amount, Note, category buttons, and a SAVE button) to add a new expense. This action directly advances the progress towards completing the active subgoal of adding the first expense.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[180,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' text field, which is currently empty. This action should focus the text field and bring up the keyboard, allowing text input for the expense name. The text field is located approximately at [180, 500]. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Name\\' text field was successful. The \\'Name\\' text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard is active, as indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' at the bottom of the screen and confirmed by the post-action screen information. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Social Club Dues\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'Social Club Dues\\' into this field.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 7: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Social Club Dues\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Social Club Dues\\' into the currently focused \\'Name\\' text field. The field currently contains placeholder text \\'Name\\'. After this action, the \\'Name\\' field should contain \\'Social Club Dues\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open \\'pro expense\\' App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'pro expense\\' app is open and its main screen is visible.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The search field currently displays \\'Search apps, web and more\\' and is focused. After this action, the search field should contain \\'pro expense\\', and search results for the app should appear. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'pro expense\\' into the search field was successful. The search bar now correctly displays \\'pro expense\\'. As a result, the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon and name appeared as the primary search result, directly below the search bar. This action has brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'pro expense\\' app. The next step is to tap on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app to launch it.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[238,166],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'Pro Expense\\' (located at approximately [238, 166]) to launch the \\'Pro Expense\\' application. The app is currently listed as a search result. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon ([238, 166]) in the search results was successful. The \\'Pro Expense\\' app launched, and its home screen is now visible, as shown in the second screenshot. This completes the first subgoal. The app\\'s home screen shows financial summaries and a \\'+\\' button, which is the next target for interaction to add an expense.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[909,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'+\\' button located at the bottom right of the screen (approximately at [909, 893]) to initiate the process of adding a new expense. The button is a blue circle with a white plus sign. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'+\\' button at [909, 893] was successful. The app transitioned from its home screen to the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen. This new screen provides the necessary interface elements (text fields for Name, Amount, Note, category buttons, and a SAVE button) to add a new expense. This action directly advances the progress towards completing the active subgoal of adding the first expense.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[180,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' text field, which is currently empty. This action should focus the text field and bring up the keyboard, allowing text input for the expense name. The text field is located approximately at [180, 500]. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Name\\' text field was successful. The \\'Name\\' text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard is active, as indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' at the bottom of the screen and confirmed by the post-action screen information. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Social Club Dues\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'Social Club Dues\\' into this field.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Social Club Dues\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Social Club Dues\\' into the currently focused \\'Name\\' text field. The field currently contains placeholder text \\'Name\\'. After this action, the \\'Name\\' field should contain \\'Social Club Dues\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Social Club Dues\\' into the \\'Name\\' text field was successful. The \\'Name\\' field now correctly displays \\'Social Club Dues\\', as seen in the second screenshot and confirmed by the screen information text. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Social Club Dues\\' expense. The next step is to interact with the \\'Amount\\' field.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.38\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 107, 519], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0 IdY: 0.0 JXv: 0.0 Expense Entry 15 Oct 2023 3.37 PM\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [144, 88, 156, 164], \\'text\\': \\'Name\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [168, 84, 188, 375], \\'text\\': \\'Social Club Dues\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [259, 88, 277, 250], \\'text\\': \\'Amount\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [328, 85, 346, 175], \\'text\\': \\'Food\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [330, 225, 346, 358], \\'text\\': \\'Income\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [328, 408, 350, 712], \\'text\\': \\'Housing Social\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [327, 763, 347, 987], \\'text\\': \\'Entertainmei\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [413, 87, 430, 171], \\'text\\': \\'Note\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [535, 372, 550, 471], \\'text\\': \\'SAVE\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [391, 57, 498, 947]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [519, 49, 569, 792]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [317, 390, 364, 571]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [317, 583, 364, 731]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [317, 208, 364, 377]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [317, 745, 364, 990]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [518, 815, 569, 947]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 819, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 899, 101, 984]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 37, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 782, 111, 869]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 141, 36, 187]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 905, 36, 945]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"0\", text=\"Social Club Dues\", resource-id=\"com.arduia.expense:id/edt_name\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"com.arduia.expense\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[63,352][1017,509]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"Social Club Dues\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The search field currently displays \\'Search apps, web and more\\' and is focused. After this action, the search field should contain \\'pro expense\\', and search results for the app should appear. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'pro expense\\' into the search field was successful. The search bar now correctly displays \\'pro expense\\'. As a result, the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon and name appeared as the primary search result, directly below the search bar. This action has brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'pro expense\\' app. The next step is to tap on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app to launch it.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[238,166],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'Pro Expense\\' (located at approximately [238, 166]) to launch the \\'Pro Expense\\' application. The app is currently listed as a search result. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon ([238, 166]) in the search results was successful. The \\'Pro Expense\\' app launched, and its home screen is now visible, as shown in the second screenshot. This completes the first subgoal. The app\\'s home screen shows financial summaries and a \\'+\\' button, which is the next target for interaction to add an expense.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[909,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'+\\' button located at the bottom right of the screen (approximately at [909, 893]) to initiate the process of adding a new expense. The button is a blue circle with a white plus sign. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'+\\' button at [909, 893] was successful. The app transitioned from its home screen to the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen. This new screen provides the necessary interface elements (text fields for Name, Amount, Note, category buttons, and a SAVE button) to add a new expense. This action directly advances the progress towards completing the active subgoal of adding the first expense.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[180,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' text field, which is currently empty. This action should focus the text field and bring up the keyboard, allowing text input for the expense name. The text field is located approximately at [180, 500]. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Name\\' text field was successful. The \\'Name\\' text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard is active, as indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' at the bottom of the screen and confirmed by the post-action screen information. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Social Club Dues\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'Social Club Dues\\' into this field.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Social Club Dues\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Social Club Dues\\' into the currently focused \\'Name\\' text field. The field currently contains placeholder text \\'Name\\'. After this action, the \\'Name\\' field should contain \\'Social Club Dues\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Social Club Dues\\' into the \\'Name\\' text field was successful. The \\'Name\\' field now correctly displays \\'Social Club Dues\\', as seen in the second screenshot and confirmed by the screen information text. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Social Club Dues\\' expense. The next step is to interact with the \\'Amount\\' field.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 8: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[270,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Amount\\' text field to select it for input. The \\'Amount\\' field is currently empty. After tapping, this field should become focused, and the keyboard should remain active, allowing for amount input. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open \\'pro expense\\' App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'pro expense\\' app is open and its main screen is visible.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[238,166],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'Pro Expense\\' (located at approximately [238, 166]) to launch the \\'Pro Expense\\' application. The app is currently listed as a search result. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon ([238, 166]) in the search results was successful. The \\'Pro Expense\\' app launched, and its home screen is now visible, as shown in the second screenshot. This completes the first subgoal. The app\\'s home screen shows financial summaries and a \\'+\\' button, which is the next target for interaction to add an expense.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[909,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'+\\' button located at the bottom right of the screen (approximately at [909, 893]) to initiate the process of adding a new expense. The button is a blue circle with a white plus sign. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'+\\' button at [909, 893] was successful. The app transitioned from its home screen to the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen. This new screen provides the necessary interface elements (text fields for Name, Amount, Note, category buttons, and a SAVE button) to add a new expense. This action directly advances the progress towards completing the active subgoal of adding the first expense.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[180,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' text field, which is currently empty. This action should focus the text field and bring up the keyboard, allowing text input for the expense name. The text field is located approximately at [180, 500]. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Name\\' text field was successful. The \\'Name\\' text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard is active, as indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' at the bottom of the screen and confirmed by the post-action screen information. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Social Club Dues\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'Social Club Dues\\' into this field.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Social Club Dues\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Social Club Dues\\' into the currently focused \\'Name\\' text field. The field currently contains placeholder text \\'Name\\'. After this action, the \\'Name\\' field should contain \\'Social Club Dues\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Social Club Dues\\' into the \\'Name\\' text field was successful. The \\'Name\\' field now correctly displays \\'Social Club Dues\\', as seen in the second screenshot and confirmed by the screen information text. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Social Club Dues\\' expense. The next step is to interact with the \\'Amount\\' field.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[270,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Amount\\' text field to select it for input. The \\'Amount\\' field is currently empty. After tapping, this field should become focused, and the keyboard should remain active, allowing for amount input. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Amount\\' text field was successful. The \\'Amount\\' text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard is active, ready for input. The text \\'USD\\' appeared next to the input area, confirming it\\'s a currency field. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Social Club Dues\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'67.41\\' into this field.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"Amount\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[238,166],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'Pro Expense\\' (located at approximately [238, 166]) to launch the \\'Pro Expense\\' application. The app is currently listed as a search result. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon ([238, 166]) in the search results was successful. The \\'Pro Expense\\' app launched, and its home screen is now visible, as shown in the second screenshot. This completes the first subgoal. The app\\'s home screen shows financial summaries and a \\'+\\' button, which is the next target for interaction to add an expense.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[909,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'+\\' button located at the bottom right of the screen (approximately at [909, 893]) to initiate the process of adding a new expense. The button is a blue circle with a white plus sign. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'+\\' button at [909, 893] was successful. The app transitioned from its home screen to the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen. This new screen provides the necessary interface elements (text fields for Name, Amount, Note, category buttons, and a SAVE button) to add a new expense. This action directly advances the progress towards completing the active subgoal of adding the first expense.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[180,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' text field, which is currently empty. This action should focus the text field and bring up the keyboard, allowing text input for the expense name. The text field is located approximately at [180, 500]. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Name\\' text field was successful. The \\'Name\\' text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard is active, as indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' at the bottom of the screen and confirmed by the post-action screen information. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Social Club Dues\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'Social Club Dues\\' into this field.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Social Club Dues\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Social Club Dues\\' into the currently focused \\'Name\\' text field. The field currently contains placeholder text \\'Name\\'. After this action, the \\'Name\\' field should contain \\'Social Club Dues\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Social Club Dues\\' into the \\'Name\\' text field was successful. The \\'Name\\' field now correctly displays \\'Social Club Dues\\', as seen in the second screenshot and confirmed by the screen information text. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Social Club Dues\\' expense. The next step is to interact with the \\'Amount\\' field.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[270,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Amount\\' text field to select it for input. The \\'Amount\\' field is currently empty. After tapping, this field should become focused, and the keyboard should remain active, allowing for amount input. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Amount\\' text field was successful. The \\'Amount\\' text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard is active, ready for input. The text \\'USD\\' appeared next to the input area, confirming it\\'s a currency field. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Social Club Dues\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'67.41\\' into this field.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 9: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"67.41\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'67.41\\' into the currently focused \\'Amount\\' text field. The field is currently empty or contains placeholder text. After this action, the \\'Amount\\' field should contain \\'67.41\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open \\'pro expense\\' App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'pro expense\\' app is open and its main screen is visible.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[909,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'+\\' button located at the bottom right of the screen (approximately at [909, 893]) to initiate the process of adding a new expense. The button is a blue circle with a white plus sign. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'+\\' button at [909, 893] was successful. The app transitioned from its home screen to the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen. This new screen provides the necessary interface elements (text fields for Name, Amount, Note, category buttons, and a SAVE button) to add a new expense. This action directly advances the progress towards completing the active subgoal of adding the first expense.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[180,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' text field, which is currently empty. This action should focus the text field and bring up the keyboard, allowing text input for the expense name. The text field is located approximately at [180, 500]. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Name\\' text field was successful. The \\'Name\\' text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard is active, as indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' at the bottom of the screen and confirmed by the post-action screen information. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Social Club Dues\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'Social Club Dues\\' into this field.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Social Club Dues\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Social Club Dues\\' into the currently focused \\'Name\\' text field. The field currently contains placeholder text \\'Name\\'. After this action, the \\'Name\\' field should contain \\'Social Club Dues\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Social Club Dues\\' into the \\'Name\\' text field was successful. The \\'Name\\' field now correctly displays \\'Social Club Dues\\', as seen in the second screenshot and confirmed by the screen information text. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Social Club Dues\\' expense. The next step is to interact with the \\'Amount\\' field.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[270,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Amount\\' text field to select it for input. The \\'Amount\\' field is currently empty. After tapping, this field should become focused, and the keyboard should remain active, allowing for amount input. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Amount\\' text field was successful. The \\'Amount\\' text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard is active, ready for input. The text \\'USD\\' appeared next to the input area, confirming it\\'s a currency field. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Social Club Dues\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'67.41\\' into this field.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"67.41\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'67.41\\' into the currently focused \\'Amount\\' text field. The field is currently empty or contains placeholder text. After this action, the \\'Amount\\' field should contain \\'67.41\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'67.41\\' into the \\'Amount\\' text field was successful. The \\'Amount\\' field now correctly displays \\'67.41\\', as confirmed by the second screenshot and the screen information text. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Social Club Dues\\' expense. The next step is to tap on the \\'Social\\' category button.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.39\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 107, 519], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0 IdY: 0.0 JXv: 0.0 Expense Entry 15 Oct 2023 3.37 PM\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [144, 88, 156, 164], \\'text\\': \\'Name\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [168, 85, 186, 375], \\'text\\': \\'Social Club Dues\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [232, 88, 246, 210], \\'text\\': \\'Amount\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [255, 86, 278, 196], \\'text\\': \\'67.41\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [257, 833, 274, 913], \\'text\\': \\'USD\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [328, 85, 346, 175], \\'text\\': \\'Food\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [330, 225, 346, 358], \\'text\\': \\'Income\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [328, 408, 350, 712], \\'text\\': \\'Housing Social\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [327, 763, 347, 987], \\'text\\': \\'Entertainmei\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [413, 87, 430, 171], \\'text\\': \\'Note\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [535, 372, 550, 471], \\'text\\': \\'SAVE\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [391, 57, 498, 947]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [519, 49, 569, 793]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [317, 390, 364, 572]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [317, 207, 364, 377]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [317, 583, 364, 731]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [317, 745, 365, 990]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [518, 815, 569, 947]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 820, 35, 899]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 782, 111, 869]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 896, 103, 987]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 905, 35, 944]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 38, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 141, 36, 188]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [948, 651, 1000, 999]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"1\", text=\"67.41\", resource-id=\"com.arduia.expense:id/edt_amount\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"com.arduia.expense\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[63,565][1017,720]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"67.41\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[909,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'+\\' button located at the bottom right of the screen (approximately at [909, 893]) to initiate the process of adding a new expense. The button is a blue circle with a white plus sign. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'+\\' button at [909, 893] was successful. The app transitioned from its home screen to the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen. This new screen provides the necessary interface elements (text fields for Name, Amount, Note, category buttons, and a SAVE button) to add a new expense. This action directly advances the progress towards completing the active subgoal of adding the first expense.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[180,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' text field, which is currently empty. This action should focus the text field and bring up the keyboard, allowing text input for the expense name. The text field is located approximately at [180, 500]. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Name\\' text field was successful. The \\'Name\\' text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard is active, as indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' at the bottom of the screen and confirmed by the post-action screen information. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Social Club Dues\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'Social Club Dues\\' into this field.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Social Club Dues\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Social Club Dues\\' into the currently focused \\'Name\\' text field. The field currently contains placeholder text \\'Name\\'. After this action, the \\'Name\\' field should contain \\'Social Club Dues\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Social Club Dues\\' into the \\'Name\\' text field was successful. The \\'Name\\' field now correctly displays \\'Social Club Dues\\', as seen in the second screenshot and confirmed by the screen information text. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Social Club Dues\\' expense. The next step is to interact with the \\'Amount\\' field.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[270,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Amount\\' text field to select it for input. The \\'Amount\\' field is currently empty. After tapping, this field should become focused, and the keyboard should remain active, allowing for amount input. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Amount\\' text field was successful. The \\'Amount\\' text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard is active, ready for input. The text \\'USD\\' appeared next to the input area, confirming it\\'s a currency field. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Social Club Dues\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'67.41\\' into this field.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"67.41\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'67.41\\' into the currently focused \\'Amount\\' text field. The field is currently empty or contains placeholder text. After this action, the \\'Amount\\' field should contain \\'67.41\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'67.41\\' into the \\'Amount\\' text field was successful. The \\'Amount\\' field now correctly displays \\'67.41\\', as confirmed by the second screenshot and the screen information text. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Social Club Dues\\' expense. The next step is to tap on the \\'Social\\' category button.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 10: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action should focus the text field and bring up the keyboard, allowing text input for the expense name. The text field is located approximately at [180, 500]. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Name\\' text field was successful. The \\'Name\\' text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard is active, as indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' at the bottom of the screen and confirmed by the post-action screen information. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Social Club Dues\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'Social Club Dues\\' into this field.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Social Club Dues\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Social Club Dues\\' into the currently focused \\'Name\\' text field. The field currently contains placeholder text \\'Name\\'. After this action, the \\'Name\\' field should contain \\'Social Club Dues\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Social Club Dues\\' into the \\'Name\\' text field was successful. The \\'Name\\' field now correctly displays \\'Social Club Dues\\', as seen in the second screenshot and confirmed by the screen information text. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Social Club Dues\\' expense. The next step is to interact with the \\'Amount\\' field.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[270,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Amount\\' text field to select it for input. The \\'Amount\\' field is currently empty. After tapping, this field should become focused, and the keyboard should remain active, allowing for amount input. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Amount\\' text field was successful. The \\'Amount\\' text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard is active, ready for input. The text \\'USD\\' appeared next to the input area, confirming it\\'s a currency field. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Social Club Dues\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'67.41\\' into this field.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"67.41\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'67.41\\' into the currently focused \\'Amount\\' text field. The field is currently empty or contains placeholder text. After this action, the \\'Amount\\' field should contain \\'67.41\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'67.41\\' into the \\'Amount\\' text field was successful. The \\'Amount\\' field now correctly displays \\'67.41\\', as confirmed by the second screenshot and the screen information text. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Social Club Dues\\' expense. The next step is to tap on the \\'Social\\' category button.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

The button is currently not selected. After tapping, the \\'Social\\' category should be selected for the expense entry. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Social\\' category button at approximately [340, 657] was successful. The \\'Social\\' category is now selected for the expense entry, as indicated by its highlighted (blue) background in the second screenshot. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Social Club Dues\\' expense. The next step is to tap on the \\'Note\\' text field.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 42, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.40\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 107, 519], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0 IdY: 0.0 JXv: 0.0 Expense Entry 15 Oct 2023 3.37 PM\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [144, 88, 156, 164], \\'text\\': \\'Name\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [168, 85, 186, 375], \\'text\\': \\'Social Club Dues\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [232, 88, 246, 210], \\'text\\': \\'Amount\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [255, 86, 278, 196], \\'text\\': \\'67.41\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [257, 833, 274, 913], \\'text\\': \\'USD\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [328, 85, 346, 175], \\'text\\': \\'Food\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [330, 225, 346, 358], \\'text\\': \\'Income\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [328, 408, 350, 712], \\'text\\': \\'Housing Social\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [327, 763, 347, 987], \\'text\\': \\'Entertainmei\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [413, 87, 430, 171], \\'text\\': \\'Note\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [535, 372, 550, 471], \\'text\\': \\'SAVE\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [390, 55, 498, 946]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [519, 49, 569, 793]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [317, 390, 364, 572]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [317, 583, 364, 732]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [317, 208, 364, 377]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [317, 745, 364, 990]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [518, 815, 569, 947]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 819, 35, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 782, 111, 870]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 895, 102, 988]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 904, 35, 944]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 38, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [948, 648, 1000, 999]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 141, 36, 188]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"1\", text=\"67.41\", resource-id=\"com.arduia.expense:id/edt_amount\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"com.arduia.expense\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[63,565][1017,720]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"67.41\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The \\'Amount\\' field is currently empty. After tapping, this field should become focused, and the keyboard should remain active, allowing for amount input. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Amount\\' text field was successful. The \\'Amount\\' text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard is active, ready for input. The text \\'USD\\' appeared next to the input area, confirming it\\'s a currency field. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Social Club Dues\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'67.41\\' into this field.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"67.41\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'67.41\\' into the currently focused \\'Amount\\' text field.

Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'67.41\\' into the \\'Amount\\' text field was successful. The \\'Amount\\' field now correctly displays \\'67.41\\', as confirmed by the second screenshot and the screen information text. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Social Club Dues\\' expense.

The button is currently not selected. After tapping, the \\'Social\\' category should be selected for the expense entry. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Social\\' category button at approximately [340, 657] was successful. The \\'Social\\' category is now selected for the expense entry, as indicated by its highlighted (blue) background in the second screenshot. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Social Club Dues\\' expense. The next step is to tap on the \\'Note\\' text field.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 11: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"Note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle.

Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders.

For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"Monthly recurring\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information.

Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The virtual keyboard remains active. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Social Club Dues\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'Monthly recurring\\' into this field.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Monthly recurring\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Monthly recurring\\' into the currently focused \\'Note\\' text field. The field is currently empty. After this action, the \\'Note\\' field should contain \\'Monthly recurring\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Monthly recurring\\' into the \\'Note\\' text field was successful. The \\'Note\\' field now correctly displays \\'Monthly recurring\\', as confirmed by the second screenshot and the screen information text. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Social Club Dues\\' expense. The next step is to tap the \\'SAVE\\' button.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[542,415],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button. The \\'SAVE\\' button is currently visible and enabled. After tapping, the expense should be saved, and the app might navigate back to the main expense list or clear the fields for a new entry. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'SAVE\\' button was successful. The \\'Social Club Dues\\' expense was saved, and the application navigated from the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen back to the \\'Home\\' screen. The newly added expense is now visible in the \\'Recent\\' list with the correct details (\\'Social Club Dues\\', \\'67.41 USD\\'). This action successfully completed the active subgoal.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[909,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'+\\' button to add a new expense. The button is located in the bottom right corner of the screen. After tapping, the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen should appear, allowing for the input of the new expense details. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'+\\' button at [909, 893] was successful. The application transitioned from the \\'Home\\' screen to the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen. This new screen provides fields to input the details of a new expense. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 44, 35, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.42\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 107, 519], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0 IdY: 0.0 JXv: 0.0 Expense Entry 15 Oct 2023 3.42 PM\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [144, 88, 156, 164], \\'text\\': \\'Name\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [258, 88, 274, 250], \\'text\\': \\'Amount\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [327, 85, 344, 175], \\'text\\': \\'Food\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [328, 225, 344, 358], \\'text\\': \\'Income\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [323, 405, 349, 712], \\'text\\': \\'Housing Social\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [325, 763, 345, 987], \\'text\\': \\'Entertainmel\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [412, 87, 428, 171], \\'text\\': \\'Note\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [533, 372, 549, 471], \\'text\\': \\'SAVE\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [389, 55, 496, 947]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [518, 49, 567, 793]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [315, 390, 362, 571]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [315, 207, 362, 377]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [315, 584, 362, 731]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [315, 745, 363, 990]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [516, 816, 566, 947]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 820, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 195, 37, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 141, 36, 187]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 899, 101, 985]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 783, 112, 869]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 905, 36, 944]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 44, 35, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.42\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 107, 519], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0 IdY: 0.0 JXv: 0.0 Expense Entry 15 Oct 2023 3.42 PM\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [144, 88, 156, 164], \\'text\\': \\'Name\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [258, 88, 274, 250], \\'text\\': \\'Amount\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [327, 85, 344, 175], \\'text\\': \\'Food\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [328, 225, 344, 358], \\'text\\': \\'Income\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [323, 405, 349, 712], \\'text\\': \\'Housing Social\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [325, 763, 345, 987], \\'text\\': \\'Entertainmel\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [412, 87, 428, 171], \\'text\\': \\'Note\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [533, 372, 549, 471], \\'text\\': \\'SAVE\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [389, 54, 496, 947]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [518, 49, 567, 793]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [315, 391, 363, 571]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [315, 207, 362, 377]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [315, 584, 362, 731]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [315, 745, 363, 990]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [516, 816, 566, 947]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 819, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 783, 111, 869]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 898, 101, 985]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 196, 37, 241]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 141, 36, 188]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 904, 36, 945]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"1\", text=\"Name\", resource-id=\"com.arduia.expense:id/edt_name\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"com.arduia.expense\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[63,352][1017,504]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"Name\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nAdd the following expenses into the pro expense:\\nExpense: Social Club Dues\\n amount_dollars: $67.41\\n category_name: Social\\n note: Monthly recurring\\n\\nExpense: Legal Fees\\n amount_dollars: $10.14\\n category_name: Others\\n note: Monthly recurring\\n\\nExpense: Stationery\\n amount_dollars: $118.93\\n category_name: Others\\n note: Remember to transfer funds\\n\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[340,657],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Social\\' category button. The button is currently not selected. After tapping, the \\'Social\\' category should be selected for the expense entry. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Social\\' category button at approximately [340, 657] was successful. The \\'Social\\' category is now selected for the expense entry, as indicated by its highlighted (blue) background in the second screenshot. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Social Club Dues\\' expense. The next step is to tap on the \\'Note\\' text field.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[444,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Note\\' text field. The field is currently empty. This action should focus the text field, allowing text input for the note. The \\'Note\\' text field is located below the category selection buttons, approximately centered at [444, 500]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Note\\' text field at approximately [444, 500] was successful. The \\'Note\\' text field is now focused and ready for text input. The virtual keyboard remains active. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Social Club Dues\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'Monthly recurring\\' into this field.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Monthly recurring\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Monthly recurring\\' into the currently focused \\'Note\\' text field. The field is currently empty. After this action, the \\'Note\\' field should contain \\'Monthly recurring\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Monthly recurring\\' into the \\'Note\\' text field was successful. The \\'Note\\' field now correctly displays \\'Monthly recurring\\', as confirmed by the second screenshot and the screen information text. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Social Club Dues\\' expense. The next step is to tap the \\'SAVE\\' button.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[542,415],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button. The \\'SAVE\\' button is currently visible and enabled. After tapping, the expense should be saved, and the app might navigate back to the main expense list or clear the fields for a new entry. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'SAVE\\' button was successful. The \\'Social Club Dues\\' expense was saved, and the application navigated from the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen back to the \\'Home\\' screen. The newly added expense is now visible in the \\'Recent\\' list with the correct details (\\'Social Club Dues\\', \\'67.41 USD\\'). This action successfully completed the active subgoal.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[909,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'+\\' button to add a new expense. The button is located in the bottom right corner of the screen. After tapping, the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen should appear, allowing for the input of the new expense details. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'+\\' button at [909, 893] was successful. The application transitioned from the \\'Home\\' screen to the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen. This new screen provides fields to input the details of a new expense. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 15: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' text field. The field is currently empty. This action should focus the text field, allowing text input for the expense name. The \\'Name\\' text field is located at the top of the screen, and I will tap approximately at [185, 500]. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open \\'pro expense\\' App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'pro expense\\' app is open and its main screen is visible.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The \\'SAVE\\' button is currently visible and enabled. After tapping, the expense should be saved, and the app might navigate back to the main expense list or clear the fields for a new entry. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'SAVE\\' button was successful. The \\'Social Club Dues\\' expense was saved, and the application navigated from the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen back to the \\'Home\\' screen. The newly added expense is now visible in the \\'Recent\\' list with the correct details (\\'Social Club Dues\\', \\'67.41 USD\\').

The text you can edit is: \"Name\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"Legal Fees\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nAdd the following expenses into the pro expense:\\nExpense: Social Club Dues\\n amount_dollars: $67.41\\n category_name: Social\\n note: Monthly recurring\\n\\nExpense: Legal Fees\\n amount_dollars: $10.14\\n category_name: Others\\n note: Monthly recurring\\n\\nExpense: Stationery\\n amount_dollars: $118.93\\n category_name: Others\\n note: Remember to transfer funds\\n\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[444,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Note\\' text field. The field is currently empty. This action should focus the text field, allowing text input for the note. The \\'Note\\' text field is located below the category selection buttons, approximately centered at [444, 500]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Note\\' text field at approximately [444, 500] was successful. The \\'Note\\' text field is now focused and ready for text input. The virtual keyboard remains active. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Social Club Dues\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'Monthly recurring\\' into this field.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Monthly recurring\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Monthly recurring\\' into the currently focused \\'Note\\' text field. The field is currently empty. After this action, the \\'Note\\' field should contain \\'Monthly recurring\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Monthly recurring\\' into the \\'Note\\' text field was successful. The \\'Note\\' field now correctly displays \\'Monthly recurring\\', as confirmed by the second screenshot and the screen information text. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Social Club Dues\\' expense. The next step is to tap the \\'SAVE\\' button.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[542,415],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button. The \\'SAVE\\' button is currently visible and enabled. After tapping, the expense should be saved, and the app might navigate back to the main expense list or clear the fields for a new entry. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'SAVE\\' button was successful. The \\'Social Club Dues\\' expense was saved, and the application navigated from the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen back to the \\'Home\\' screen. The newly added expense is now visible in the \\'Recent\\' list with the correct details (\\'Social Club Dues\\', \\'67.41 USD\\'). This action successfully completed the active subgoal.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[909,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'+\\' button to add a new expense. The button is located in the bottom right corner of the screen. After tapping, the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen should appear, allowing for the input of the new expense details. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'+\\' button at [909, 893] was successful. The application transitioned from the \\'Home\\' screen to the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen. This new screen provides fields to input the details of a new expense. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' text field. The field is currently empty. This action should focus the text field, allowing text input for the expense name. The \\'Name\\' text field is located at the top of the screen, and I will tap approximately at [185, 500]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Name\\' text field at approximately [185, 500] was successful. The \\'Name\\' text field is now focused, as indicated by the blue underline and the appearance of the virtual keyboard. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'Legal Fees\\' into this field.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 16: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Legal Fees\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Legal Fees\\' into the currently focused \\'Name\\' text field. The field currently contains the placeholder \\'Name\\'. After this action, the \\'Name\\' field should contain \\'Legal Fees\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open \\'pro expense\\' App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'pro expense\\' app is open and its main screen is visible.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The \\'SAVE\\' button is currently visible and enabled. After tapping, the expense should be saved, and the app might navigate back to the main expense list or clear the fields for a new entry. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'SAVE\\' button was successful. The \\'Social Club Dues\\' expense was saved, and the application navigated from the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen back to the \\'Home\\' screen. The newly added expense is now visible in the \\'Recent\\' list with the correct details (\\'Social Club Dues\\', \\'67.41 USD\\').

The button is located in the bottom right corner of the screen. After tapping, the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen should appear, allowing for the input of the new expense details. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'+\\' button at [909, 893] was successful. The application transitioned from the \\'Home\\' screen to the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen. This new screen provides fields to input the details of a new expense. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

The field is currently empty. This action should focus the text field, allowing text input for the expense name. The \\'Name\\' text field is located at the top of the screen, and I will tap approximately at [185, 500]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Name\\' text field at approximately [185, 500] was successful. The \\'Name\\' text field is now focused, as indicated by the blue underline and the appearance of the virtual keyboard. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'Legal Fees\\' into this field.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Legal Fees\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Legal Fees\\' into the currently focused \\'Name\\' text field. The field currently contains the placeholder \\'Name\\'. After this action, the \\'Name\\' field should contain \\'Legal Fees\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Legal Fees\\' into the \\'Name\\' text field was successful. The \\'Name\\' field now correctly displays \\'Legal Fees\\', as confirmed by the second screenshot and the screen information text.

The text you can edit is: \"Legal Fees\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The field is currently empty. After this action, the \\'Note\\' field should contain \\'Monthly recurring\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Monthly recurring\\' into the \\'Note\\' text field was successful. The \\'Note\\' field now correctly displays \\'Monthly recurring\\', as confirmed by the second screenshot and the screen information text. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Social Club Dues\\' expense. The next step is to tap the \\'SAVE\\' button.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[542,415],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button. The \\'SAVE\\' button is currently visible and enabled. After tapping, the expense should be saved, and the app might navigate back to the main expense list or clear the fields for a new entry. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'SAVE\\' button was successful. The \\'Social Club Dues\\' expense was saved, and the application navigated from the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen back to the \\'Home\\' screen. The newly added expense is now visible in the \\'Recent\\' list with the correct details (\\'Social Club Dues\\', \\'67.41 USD\\').

The button is located in the bottom right corner of the screen. After tapping, the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen should appear, allowing for the input of the new expense details. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'+\\' button at [909, 893] was successful. The application transitioned from the \\'Home\\' screen to the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen. This new screen provides fields to input the details of a new expense. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' text field. The field is currently empty. This action should focus the text field, allowing text input for the expense name. The \\'Name\\' text field is located at the top of the screen, and I will tap approximately at [185, 500]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Name\\' text field at approximately [185, 500] was successful. The \\'Name\\' text field is now focused, as indicated by the blue underline and the appearance of the virtual keyboard. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'Legal Fees\\' into this field.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Legal Fees\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Legal Fees\\' into the currently focused \\'Name\\' text field.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[542,415],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button. The \\'SAVE\\' button is currently visible and enabled. After tapping, the expense should be saved, and the app might navigate back to the main expense list or clear the fields for a new entry. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'SAVE\\' button was successful. The \\'Social Club Dues\\' expense was saved, and the application navigated from the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen back to the \\'Home\\' screen. The newly added expense is now visible in the \\'Recent\\' list with the correct details (\\'Social Club Dues\\', \\'67.41 USD\\'). This action successfully completed the active subgoal.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[909,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'+\\' button to add a new expense. The button is located in the bottom right corner of the screen. After tapping, the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen should appear, allowing for the input of the new expense details. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'+\\' button at [909, 893] was successful. The application transitioned from the \\'Home\\' screen to the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen. This new screen provides fields to input the details of a new expense. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' text field. The field is currently empty. This action should focus the text field, allowing text input for the expense name. The \\'Name\\' text field is located at the top of the screen, and I will tap approximately at [185, 500]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Name\\' text field at approximately [185, 500] was successful. The \\'Name\\' text field is now focused, as indicated by the blue underline and the appearance of the virtual keyboard. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'Legal Fees\\' into this field.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Legal Fees\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Legal Fees\\' into the currently focused \\'Name\\' text field. The field currently contains the placeholder \\'Name\\'. After this action, the \\'Name\\' field should contain \\'Legal Fees\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Legal Fees\\' into the \\'Name\\' text field was successful. The \\'Name\\' field now correctly displays \\'Legal Fees\\', as confirmed by the second screenshot and the screen information text. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to tap on the \\'Amount\\' text field.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Amount\\' text field. The field is currently empty. This action should focus the text field, allowing text input for the expense amount. The \\'Amount\\' text field is located below the \\'Name\\' field. I will tap approximately at [268, 500]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Amount\\' text field at approximately [268, 500] was successful. The \\'Amount\\' text field is now focused, as indicated by the cursor, the \\'USD\\' label, and the XML data. The virtual keyboard is visible. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'10.14\\' into this field.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"Amount\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[542,415],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button. The \\'SAVE\\' button is currently visible and enabled. After tapping, the expense should be saved, and the app might navigate back to the main expense list or clear the fields for a new entry. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'SAVE\\' button was successful. The \\'Social Club Dues\\' expense was saved, and the application navigated from the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen back to the \\'Home\\' screen. The newly added expense is now visible in the \\'Recent\\' list with the correct details (\\'Social Club Dues\\', \\'67.41 USD\\'). This action successfully completed the active subgoal.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[909,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'+\\' button to add a new expense. The button is located in the bottom right corner of the screen. After tapping, the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen should appear, allowing for the input of the new expense details. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'+\\' button at [909, 893] was successful. The application transitioned from the \\'Home\\' screen to the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen. This new screen provides fields to input the details of a new expense. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' text field. The field is currently empty. This action should focus the text field, allowing text input for the expense name. The \\'Name\\' text field is located at the top of the screen, and I will tap approximately at [185, 500]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Name\\' text field at approximately [185, 500] was successful. The \\'Name\\' text field is now focused, as indicated by the blue underline and the appearance of the virtual keyboard. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'Legal Fees\\' into this field.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Legal Fees\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Legal Fees\\' into the currently focused \\'Name\\' text field. The field currently contains the placeholder \\'Name\\'. After this action, the \\'Name\\' field should contain \\'Legal Fees\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Legal Fees\\' into the \\'Name\\' text field was successful. The \\'Name\\' field now correctly displays \\'Legal Fees\\', as confirmed by the second screenshot and the screen information text. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to tap on the \\'Amount\\' text field.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Amount\\' text field. The field is currently empty. This action should focus the text field, allowing text input for the expense amount. The \\'Amount\\' text field is located below the \\'Name\\' field. I will tap approximately at [268, 500]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Amount\\' text field at approximately [268, 500] was successful. The \\'Amount\\' text field is now focused, as indicated by the cursor, the \\'USD\\' label, and the XML data. The virtual keyboard is visible. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'10.14\\' into this field.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 18: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"10.14\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'10.14\\' into the currently focused \\'Amount\\' text field. The field is currently empty. After this action, the \\'Amount\\' field should contain \\'10.14\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open \\'pro expense\\' App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'pro expense\\' app is open and its main screen is visible.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[909,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'+\\' button to add a new expense. The button is located in the bottom right corner of the screen. After tapping, the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen should appear, allowing for the input of the new expense details. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'+\\' button at [909, 893] was successful. The application transitioned from the \\'Home\\' screen to the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen. This new screen provides fields to input the details of a new expense. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' text field. The field is currently empty. This action should focus the text field, allowing text input for the expense name. The \\'Name\\' text field is located at the top of the screen, and I will tap approximately at [185, 500]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Name\\' text field at approximately [185, 500] was successful. The \\'Name\\' text field is now focused, as indicated by the blue underline and the appearance of the virtual keyboard. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'Legal Fees\\' into this field.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Legal Fees\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Legal Fees\\' into the currently focused \\'Name\\' text field. The field currently contains the placeholder \\'Name\\'. After this action, the \\'Name\\' field should contain \\'Legal Fees\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Legal Fees\\' into the \\'Name\\' text field was successful. The \\'Name\\' field now correctly displays \\'Legal Fees\\', as confirmed by the second screenshot and the screen information text. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to tap on the \\'Amount\\' text field.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Amount\\' text field. The field is currently empty. This action should focus the text field, allowing text input for the expense amount. The \\'Amount\\' text field is located below the \\'Name\\' field. I will tap approximately at [268, 500]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Amount\\' text field at approximately [268, 500] was successful. The \\'Amount\\' text field is now focused, as indicated by the cursor, the \\'USD\\' label, and the XML data. The virtual keyboard is visible. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'10.14\\' into this field.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"10.14\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'10.14\\' into the currently focused \\'Amount\\' text field. The field is currently empty. After this action, the \\'Amount\\' field should contain \\'10.14\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'10.14\\' into the \\'Amount\\' text field was successful. The \\'Amount\\' field now correctly displays \\'10.14\\', as confirmed by the second screenshot and the screen information text. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to select the \\'Others\\' category.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing.

The text you can edit is: \"10.14\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[909,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'+\\' button to add a new expense. The button is located in the bottom right corner of the screen. After tapping, the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen should appear, allowing for the input of the new expense details. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'+\\' button at [909, 893] was successful. The application transitioned from the \\'Home\\' screen to the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen. This new screen provides fields to input the details of a new expense. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' text field. The field is currently empty. This action should focus the text field, allowing text input for the expense name. The \\'Name\\' text field is located at the top of the screen, and I will tap approximately at [185, 500]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Name\\' text field at approximately [185, 500] was successful. The \\'Name\\' text field is now focused, as indicated by the blue underline and the appearance of the virtual keyboard. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'Legal Fees\\' into this field.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Legal Fees\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Legal Fees\\' into the currently focused \\'Name\\' text field. The field currently contains the placeholder \\'Name\\'. After this action, the \\'Name\\' field should contain \\'Legal Fees\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Legal Fees\\' into the \\'Name\\' text field was successful. The \\'Name\\' field now correctly displays \\'Legal Fees\\', as confirmed by the second screenshot and the screen information text. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to tap on the \\'Amount\\' text field.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Amount\\' text field. The field is currently empty. This action should focus the text field, allowing text input for the expense amount. The \\'Amount\\' text field is located below the \\'Name\\' field. I will tap approximately at [268, 500]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Amount\\' text field at approximately [268, 500] was successful. The \\'Amount\\' text field is now focused, as indicated by the cursor, the \\'USD\\' label, and the XML data. The virtual keyboard is visible. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'10.14\\' into this field.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"10.14\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'10.14\\' into the currently focused \\'Amount\\' text field. The field is currently empty. After this action, the \\'Amount\\' field should contain \\'10.14\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'10.14\\' into the \\'Amount\\' text field was successful. The \\'Amount\\' field now correctly displays \\'10.14\\', as confirmed by the second screenshot and the screen information text. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to select the \\'Others\\' category.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 19: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[337,875],\"end_point\":[337,100],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left on the category buttons, starting from the center of the \\'Entertainmei\\' button (approx. [337, 875]) to a point further left (e.g., [337, 100]). This action is intended to reveal more category options, including \\'Others\\'.

Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The field is currently empty. This action should focus the text field, allowing text input for the expense name. The \\'Name\\' text field is located at the top of the screen, and I will tap approximately at [185, 500]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Name\\' text field at approximately [185, 500] was successful. The \\'Name\\' text field is now focused, as indicated by the blue underline and the appearance of the virtual keyboard. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'Legal Fees\\' into this field.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Legal Fees\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Legal Fees\\' into the currently focused \\'Name\\' text field.

Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Legal Fees\\' into the \\'Name\\' text field was successful. The \\'Name\\' field now correctly displays \\'Legal Fees\\', as confirmed by the second screenshot and the screen information text. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to tap on the \\'Amount\\' text field.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Amount\\' text field. The field is currently empty. This action should focus the text field, allowing text input for the expense amount. The \\'Amount\\' text field is located below the \\'Name\\' field. I will tap approximately at [268, 500]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Amount\\' text field at approximately [268, 500] was successful. The \\'Amount\\' text field is now focused, as indicated by the cursor, the \\'USD\\' label, and the XML data. The virtual keyboard is visible. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'10.14\\' into this field.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"10.14\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'10.14\\' into the currently focused \\'Amount\\' text field. The field is currently empty. After this action, the \\'Amount\\' field should contain \\'10.14\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'10.14\\' into the \\'Amount\\' text field was successful. The \\'Amount\\' field now correctly displays \\'10.14\\', as confirmed by the second screenshot and the screen information text. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to select the \\'Others\\' category.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[337,875],\"end_point\":[337,100],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left on the category buttons, starting from the center of the \\'Entertainmei\\' button (approx. [337, 875]) to a point further left (e.g., [337, 100]). This action is intended to reveal more category options, including \\'Others\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the category buttons to the left. New categories (\\'Transportation\\', \\'Clothes\\', \\'Health Care\\') are now visible. However, the target category \\'Others\\' is still not visible. The action brought the agent closer to the goal by revealing more categories, but it did not fully achieve the immediate objective of finding \\'Others\\'. Another swipe to the left is required.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing.

The text you can edit is: \"10.14\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right.

The field is currently empty. This action should focus the text field, allowing text input for the expense name. The \\'Name\\' text field is located at the top of the screen, and I will tap approximately at [185, 500]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Name\\' text field at approximately [185, 500] was successful. The \\'Name\\' text field is now focused, as indicated by the blue underline and the appearance of the virtual keyboard. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'Legal Fees\\' into this field.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Legal Fees\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Legal Fees\\' into the currently focused \\'Name\\' text field. The field currently contains the placeholder \\'Name\\'. After this action, the \\'Name\\' field should contain \\'Legal Fees\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Legal Fees\\' into the \\'Name\\' text field was successful. The \\'Name\\' field now correctly displays \\'Legal Fees\\', as confirmed by the second screenshot and the screen information text. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to tap on the \\'Amount\\' text field.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Amount\\' text field. The field is currently empty. This action should focus the text field, allowing text input for the expense amount. The \\'Amount\\' text field is located below the \\'Name\\' field. I will tap approximately at [268, 500]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Amount\\' text field at approximately [268, 500] was successful. The \\'Amount\\' text field is now focused, as indicated by the cursor, the \\'USD\\' label, and the XML data. The virtual keyboard is visible. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'10.14\\' into this field.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"10.14\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'10.14\\' into the currently focused \\'Amount\\' text field. The field is currently empty. After this action, the \\'Amount\\' field should contain \\'10.14\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'10.14\\' into the \\'Amount\\' text field was successful. The \\'Amount\\' field now correctly displays \\'10.14\\', as confirmed by the second screenshot and the screen information text. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to select the \\'Others\\' category.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[337,875],\"end_point\":[337,100],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left on the category buttons, starting from the center of the \\'Entertainmei\\' button (approx. [337, 875]) to a point further left (e.g., [337, 100]). This action is intended to reveal more category options, including \\'Others\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the category buttons to the left. New categories (\\'Transportation\\', \\'Clothes\\', \\'Health Care\\') are now visible. However, the target category \\'Others\\' is still not visible. The action brought the agent closer to the goal by revealing more categories, but it did not fully achieve the immediate objective of finding \\'Others\\'. Another swipe to the left is required.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 20: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[337,861],\"end_point\":[337,100],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left on the category buttons, starting from the center of the \\'Health Care\\' button (approx. [337, 861]) to a point further left (e.g., [337, 100]). This action is intended to reveal more category options, hopefully including \\'Others\\'.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The \\'Amount\\' text field is now focused, as indicated by the cursor, the \\'USD\\' label, and the XML data. The virtual keyboard is visible. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense.

[337, 875]) to a point further left (e.g., [337, 100]). This action is intended to reveal more category options, including \\'Others\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the category buttons to the left. New categories (\\'Transportation\\', \\'Clothes\\', \\'Health Care\\') are now visible. However, the target category \\'Others\\' is still not visible. The action brought the agent closer to the goal by revealing more categories, but it did not fully achieve the immediate objective of finding \\'Others\\'. Another swipe to the left is required.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[337,861],\"end_point\":[337,100],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left on the category buttons, starting from the center of the \\'Health Care\\' button (approx.

Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the category buttons to the left, revealing new categories. The \\'Others\\' category is now visible on the screen. This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The next step is to tap on the \\'Others\\' category button.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"10.14\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

[337, 875]) to a point further left (e.g., [337, 100]). This action is intended to reveal more category options, including \\'Others\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the category buttons to the left. New categories (\\'Transportation\\', \\'Clothes\\', \\'Health Care\\') are now visible. However, the target category \\'Others\\' is still not visible. The action brought the agent closer to the goal by revealing more categories, but it did not fully achieve the immediate objective of finding \\'Others\\'.

[337, 861]) to a point further left (e.g., [337, 100]). This action is intended to reveal more category options, hopefully including \\'Others\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the category buttons to the left, revealing new categories. The \\'Others\\' category is now visible on the screen. This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The next step is to tap on the \\'Others\\' category button.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 21: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Amount\\' text field. The field is currently empty. This action should focus the text field, allowing text input for the expense amount. The \\'Amount\\' text field is located below the \\'Name\\' field. I will tap approximately at [268, 500]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Amount\\' text field at approximately [268, 500] was successful. The \\'Amount\\' text field is now focused, as indicated by the cursor, the \\'USD\\' label, and the XML data. The virtual keyboard is visible. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'10.14\\' into this field.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"10.14\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'10.14\\' into the currently focused \\'Amount\\' text field. The field is currently empty. After this action, the \\'Amount\\' field should contain \\'10.14\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'10.14\\' into the \\'Amount\\' text field was successful. The \\'Amount\\' field now correctly displays \\'10.14\\', as confirmed by the second screenshot and the screen information text. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to select the \\'Others\\' category.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[337,875],\"end_point\":[337,100],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left on the category buttons, starting from the center of the \\'Entertainmei\\' button (approx. [337, 875]) to a point further left (e.g., [337, 100]). This action is intended to reveal more category options, including \\'Others\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the category buttons to the left. New categories (\\'Transportation\\', \\'Clothes\\', \\'Health Care\\') are now visible. However, the target category \\'Others\\' is still not visible. The action brought the agent closer to the goal by revealing more categories, but it did not fully achieve the immediate objective of finding \\'Others\\'. Another swipe to the left is required.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[337,861],\"end_point\":[337,100],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left on the category buttons, starting from the center of the \\'Health Care\\' button (approx. [337, 861]) to a point further left (e.g., [337, 100]). This action is intended to reveal more category options, hopefully including \\'Others\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the category buttons to the left, revealing new categories. The \\'Others\\' category is now visible on the screen. This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The next step is to tap on the \\'Others\\' category button.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[338,857],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Others\\' category button. The button is currently not selected. After this action, the \\'Others\\' category should be selected, and the button\\'s appearance might change to indicate selection. The coordinates for the tap are approximately the center of the \\'Others\\' button. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Others\\' category button was successful. The \\'Others\\' category is now selected, as indicated by the highlighted button in the screenshot. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to tap on the \\'Note\\' text field.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing.

The text you can edit is: \"10.14\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle.

Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The field is currently empty. This action should focus the text field, allowing text input for the expense amount. The \\'Amount\\' text field is located below the \\'Name\\' field. I will tap approximately at [268, 500]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Amount\\' text field at approximately [268, 500] was successful. The \\'Amount\\' text field is now focused, as indicated by the cursor, the \\'USD\\' label, and the XML data. The virtual keyboard is visible. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense.

The field is currently empty. After this action, the \\'Amount\\' field should contain \\'10.14\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'10.14\\' into the \\'Amount\\' text field was successful. The \\'Amount\\' field now correctly displays \\'10.14\\', as confirmed by the second screenshot and the screen information text. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to select the \\'Others\\' category.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[337,875],\"end_point\":[337,100],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left on the category buttons, starting from the center of the \\'Entertainmei\\' button (approx. [337, 875]) to a point further left (e.g., [337, 100]). This action is intended to reveal more category options, including \\'Others\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the category buttons to the left. New categories (\\'Transportation\\', \\'Clothes\\', \\'Health Care\\') are now visible. However, the target category \\'Others\\' is still not visible. The action brought the agent closer to the goal by revealing more categories, but it did not fully achieve the immediate objective of finding \\'Others\\'. Another swipe to the left is required.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[337,861],\"end_point\":[337,100],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left on the category buttons, starting from the center of the \\'Health Care\\' button (approx. [337, 861]) to a point further left (e.g., [337, 100]). This action is intended to reveal more category options, hopefully including \\'Others\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the category buttons to the left, revealing new categories. The \\'Others\\' category is now visible on the screen.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"Note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"Monthly recurring\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nAdd the following expenses into the pro expense:\\nExpense: Social Club Dues\\n amount_dollars: $67.41\\n category_name: Social\\n note: Monthly recurring\\n\\nExpense: Legal Fees\\n amount_dollars: $10.14\\n category_name: Others\\n note: Monthly recurring\\n\\nExpense: Stationery\\n amount_dollars: $118.93\\n category_name: Others\\n note: Remember to transfer funds\\n\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"10.14\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'10.14\\' into the currently focused \\'Amount\\' text field. The field is currently empty. After this action, the \\'Amount\\' field should contain \\'10.14\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'10.14\\' into the \\'Amount\\' text field was successful. The \\'Amount\\' field now correctly displays \\'10.14\\', as confirmed by the second screenshot and the screen information text. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to select the \\'Others\\' category.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[337,875],\"end_point\":[337,100],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left on the category buttons, starting from the center of the \\'Entertainmei\\' button (approx. [337, 875]) to a point further left (e.g., [337, 100]). This action is intended to reveal more category options, including \\'Others\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the category buttons to the left. New categories (\\'Transportation\\', \\'Clothes\\', \\'Health Care\\') are now visible. However, the target category \\'Others\\' is still not visible. The action brought the agent closer to the goal by revealing more categories, but it did not fully achieve the immediate objective of finding \\'Others\\'. Another swipe to the left is required.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[337,861],\"end_point\":[337,100],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left on the category buttons, starting from the center of the \\'Health Care\\' button (approx. [337, 861]) to a point further left (e.g., [337, 100]). This action is intended to reveal more category options, hopefully including \\'Others\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the category buttons to the left, revealing new categories. The \\'Others\\' category is now visible on the screen. This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The next step is to tap on the \\'Others\\' category button.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[338,857],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Others\\' category button. The button is currently not selected. After this action, the \\'Others\\' category should be selected, and the button\\'s appearance might change to indicate selection. The coordinates for the tap are approximately the center of the \\'Others\\' button. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Others\\' category button was successful. The \\'Others\\' category is now selected, as indicated by the highlighted button in the screenshot. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to tap on the \\'Note\\' text field.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[444,502],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Note\\' text field. The field is currently empty. This action should focus the text field, allowing text input for the expense note. The \\'Note\\' text field is located below the category selection. I will tap approximately at the center of the \\'Note\\' field, which is around [444, 502]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Note\\' text field at approximately [444, 502] was successful. The \\'Note\\' text field is now focused, as indicated by the cursor in the field and the updated XML data. The virtual keyboard is visible. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'Monthly recurring\\' into this field.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 23: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Monthly recurring\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Monthly recurring\\' into the currently focused \\'Note\\' text field. The field is currently empty or contains placeholder text. After this action, the \\'Note\\' field should contain \\'Monthly recurring\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open \\'pro expense\\' App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'pro expense\\' app is open and its main screen is visible.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

[337, 875]) to a point further left (e.g., [337, 100]). This action is intended to reveal more category options, including \\'Others\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the category buttons to the left. New categories (\\'Transportation\\', \\'Clothes\\', \\'Health Care\\') are now visible. However, the target category \\'Others\\' is still not visible. The action brought the agent closer to the goal by revealing more categories, but it did not fully achieve the immediate objective of finding \\'Others\\'. Another swipe to the left is required.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[337,861],\"end_point\":[337,100],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left on the category buttons, starting from the center of the \\'Health Care\\' button (approx. [337, 861]) to a point further left (e.g., [337, 100]). This action is intended to reveal more category options, hopefully including \\'Others\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the category buttons to the left, revealing new categories. The \\'Others\\' category is now visible on the screen. This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The next step is to tap on the \\'Others\\' category button.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[338,857],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Others\\' category button. The button is currently not selected. After this action, the \\'Others\\' category should be selected, and the button\\'s appearance might change to indicate selection. The coordinates for the tap are approximately the center of the \\'Others\\' button. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Others\\' category button was successful. The \\'Others\\' category is now selected, as indicated by the highlighted button in the screenshot. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to tap on the \\'Note\\' text field.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[444,502],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Note\\' text field. The field is currently empty. This action should focus the text field, allowing text input for the expense note. The \\'Note\\' text field is located below the category selection. I will tap approximately at the center of the \\'Note\\' field, which is around [444, 502]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Note\\' text field at approximately [444, 502] was successful. The \\'Note\\' text field is now focused, as indicated by the cursor in the field and the updated XML data. The virtual keyboard is visible. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'Monthly recurring\\' into this field.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Monthly recurring\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Monthly recurring\\' into the currently focused \\'Note\\' text field. The field is currently empty or contains placeholder text. After this action, the \\'Note\\' field should contain \\'Monthly recurring\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Monthly recurring\\' into the \\'Note\\' text field was successful. The \\'Note\\' field now correctly displays \\'Monthly recurring\\', as confirmed by the second screenshot and the screen information text. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to tap the \\'SAVE\\' button.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"Monthly recurring\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

[337, 875]) to a point further left (e.g., [337, 100]). This action is intended to reveal more category options, including \\'Others\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the category buttons to the left. New categories (\\'Transportation\\', \\'Clothes\\', \\'Health Care\\') are now visible. However, the target category \\'Others\\' is still not visible. The action brought the agent closer to the goal by revealing more categories, but it did not fully achieve the immediate objective of finding \\'Others\\'. Another swipe to the left is required.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[337,861],\"end_point\":[337,100],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left on the category buttons, starting from the center of the \\'Health Care\\' button (approx. [337, 861]) to a point further left (e.g., [337, 100]). This action is intended to reveal more category options, hopefully including \\'Others\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the category buttons to the left, revealing new categories. The \\'Others\\' category is now visible on the screen. This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The next step is to tap on the \\'Others\\' category button.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[338,857],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Others\\' category button. The button is currently not selected. After this action, the \\'Others\\' category should be selected, and the button\\'s appearance might change to indicate selection. The coordinates for the tap are approximately the center of the \\'Others\\' button. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Others\\' category button was successful. The \\'Others\\' category is now selected, as indicated by the highlighted button in the screenshot. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to tap on the \\'Note\\' text field.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[444,502],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Note\\' text field. The field is currently empty. This action should focus the text field, allowing text input for the expense note. The \\'Note\\' text field is located below the category selection. I will tap approximately at the center of the \\'Note\\' field, which is around [444, 502]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Note\\' text field at approximately [444, 502] was successful. The \\'Note\\' text field is now focused, as indicated by the cursor in the field and the updated XML data. The virtual keyboard is visible. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'Monthly recurring\\' into this field.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Monthly recurring\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Monthly recurring\\' into the currently focused \\'Note\\' text field. The field is currently empty or contains placeholder text. After this action, the \\'Note\\' field should contain \\'Monthly recurring\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Monthly recurring\\' into the \\'Note\\' text field was successful. The \\'Note\\' field now correctly displays \\'Monthly recurring\\', as confirmed by the second screenshot and the screen information text. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to tap the \\'SAVE\\' button.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 24: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

The button is currently active and ready to be pressed. After this action, the expense \\'Legal Fees\\' should be saved, and the app will likely navigate back to the main expense list screen or a confirmation screen.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

[337, 861]) to a point further left (e.g., [337, 100]). This action is intended to reveal more category options, hopefully including \\'Others\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the category buttons to the left, revealing new categories. The \\'Others\\' category is now visible on the screen. This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The next step is to tap on the \\'Others\\' category button.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[338,857],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Others\\' category button. The button is currently not selected. After this action, the \\'Others\\' category should be selected, and the button\\'s appearance might change to indicate selection. The coordinates for the tap are approximately the center of the \\'Others\\' button. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Others\\' category button was successful. The \\'Others\\' category is now selected, as indicated by the highlighted button in the screenshot. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to tap on the \\'Note\\' text field.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[444,502],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Note\\' text field. The field is currently empty. This action should focus the text field, allowing text input for the expense note. The \\'Note\\' text field is located below the category selection. I will tap approximately at the center of the \\'Note\\' field, which is around [444, 502]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Note\\' text field at approximately [444, 502] was successful. The \\'Note\\' text field is now focused, as indicated by the cursor in the field and the updated XML data. The virtual keyboard is visible. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'Monthly recurring\\' into this field.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Monthly recurring\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Monthly recurring\\' into the currently focused \\'Note\\' text field. The field is currently empty or contains placeholder text. After this action, the \\'Note\\' field should contain \\'Monthly recurring\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Monthly recurring\\' into the \\'Note\\' text field was successful. The \\'Note\\' field now correctly displays \\'Monthly recurring\\', as confirmed by the second screenshot and the screen information text. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to tap the \\'SAVE\\' button.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[543,415],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button. The button is currently active and ready to be pressed. After this action, the expense \\'Legal Fees\\' should be saved, and the app will likely navigate back to the main expense list screen or a confirmation screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'SAVE\\' button was successful. The \\'Legal Fees\\' expense was saved, and the application navigated back to the \\'Home\\' screen. The \\'Legal Fees\\' expense (10.14 USD) is now visible in the list of recent expenses. This completes Subgoal 3. The agent is now ready to proceed with Subgoal 4.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

[337, 861]) to a point further left (e.g., [337, 100]). This action is intended to reveal more category options, hopefully including \\'Others\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the category buttons to the left, revealing new categories. The \\'Others\\' category is now visible on the screen. This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The next step is to tap on the \\'Others\\' category button.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[338,857],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Others\\' category button. The button is currently not selected. After this action, the \\'Others\\' category should be selected, and the button\\'s appearance might change to indicate selection. The coordinates for the tap are approximately the center of the \\'Others\\' button. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Others\\' category button was successful. The \\'Others\\' category is now selected, as indicated by the highlighted button in the screenshot. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to tap on the \\'Note\\' text field.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[444,502],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Note\\' text field. The field is currently empty. This action should focus the text field, allowing text input for the expense note. The \\'Note\\' text field is located below the category selection. I will tap approximately at the center of the \\'Note\\' field, which is around [444, 502]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Note\\' text field at approximately [444, 502] was successful. The \\'Note\\' text field is now focused, as indicated by the cursor in the field and the updated XML data. The virtual keyboard is visible. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'Monthly recurring\\' into this field.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Monthly recurring\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Monthly recurring\\' into the currently focused \\'Note\\' text field. The field is currently empty or contains placeholder text. After this action, the \\'Note\\' field should contain \\'Monthly recurring\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Monthly recurring\\' into the \\'Note\\' text field was successful. The \\'Note\\' field now correctly displays \\'Monthly recurring\\', as confirmed by the second screenshot and the screen information text. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to tap the \\'SAVE\\' button.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[543,415],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button. The button is currently active and ready to be pressed. After this action, the expense \\'Legal Fees\\' should be saved, and the app will likely navigate back to the main expense list screen or a confirmation screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'SAVE\\' button was successful. The \\'Legal Fees\\' expense was saved, and the application navigated back to the \\'Home\\' screen. The \\'Legal Fees\\' expense (10.14 USD) is now visible in the list of recent expenses. This completes Subgoal 3. The agent is now ready to proceed with Subgoal 4.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 25: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[909,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'+\\' button to add a new expense. The button is located in the bottom right corner. After this action, the app should navigate to the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open \\'pro expense\\' App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'pro expense\\' app is open and its main screen is visible.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[338,857],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Others\\' category button. The button is currently not selected. After this action, the \\'Others\\' category should be selected, and the button\\'s appearance might change to indicate selection. The coordinates for the tap are approximately the center of the \\'Others\\' button. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Others\\' category button was successful. The \\'Others\\' category is now selected, as indicated by the highlighted button in the screenshot. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to tap on the \\'Note\\' text field.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[444,502],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Note\\' text field. The field is currently empty. This action should focus the text field, allowing text input for the expense note. The \\'Note\\' text field is located below the category selection. I will tap approximately at the center of the \\'Note\\' field, which is around [444, 502]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Note\\' text field at approximately [444, 502] was successful. The \\'Note\\' text field is now focused, as indicated by the cursor in the field and the updated XML data. The virtual keyboard is visible. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'Monthly recurring\\' into this field.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Monthly recurring\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Monthly recurring\\' into the currently focused \\'Note\\' text field. The field is currently empty or contains placeholder text. After this action, the \\'Note\\' field should contain \\'Monthly recurring\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Monthly recurring\\' into the \\'Note\\' text field was successful. The \\'Note\\' field now correctly displays \\'Monthly recurring\\', as confirmed by the second screenshot and the screen information text. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to tap the \\'SAVE\\' button.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[543,415],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button. The button is currently active and ready to be pressed. After this action, the expense \\'Legal Fees\\' should be saved, and the app will likely navigate back to the main expense list screen or a confirmation screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'SAVE\\' button was successful. The \\'Legal Fees\\' expense was saved, and the application navigated back to the \\'Home\\' screen. The \\'Legal Fees\\' expense (10.14 USD) is now visible in the list of recent expenses. This completes Subgoal 3. The agent is now ready to proceed with Subgoal 4.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[909,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'+\\' button to add a new expense. The button is located in the bottom right corner. After this action, the app should navigate to the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'+\\' button at [909, 893] was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Home\\' screen to the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen. This brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4, which is to add the \\'Stationery\\' expense.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.47\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 107, 519], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0 IdY: 0.0 JXv: 0.0 Expense Entry 15 Oct 2023 3.47 PM\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [144, 88, 156, 164], \\'text\\': \\'Name\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [258, 88, 274, 250], \\'text\\': \\'Amount\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [327, 85, 344, 175], \\'text\\': \\'Food\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [328, 225, 344, 358], \\'text\\': \\'Income\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [323, 405, 349, 712], \\'text\\': \\'Housing Social\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [325, 763, 345, 987], \\'text\\': \\'Entertainmel\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [412, 87, 428, 171], \\'text\\': \\'Note\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [533, 372, 549, 471], \\'text\\': \\'SAVE\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [389, 55, 496, 947]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [518, 49, 567, 793]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [315, 390, 362, 571]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [315, 207, 362, 377]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [315, 584, 362, 731]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [315, 745, 363, 991]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [516, 816, 566, 947]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 819, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 37, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 899, 101, 985]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 782, 112, 870]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 141, 36, 188]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 904, 36, 945]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[338,857],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Others\\' category button. The button is currently not selected. After this action, the \\'Others\\' category should be selected, and the button\\'s appearance might change to indicate selection. The coordinates for the tap are approximately the center of the \\'Others\\' button. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Others\\' category button was successful. The \\'Others\\' category is now selected, as indicated by the highlighted button in the screenshot. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to tap on the \\'Note\\' text field.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[444,502],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Note\\' text field. The field is currently empty. This action should focus the text field, allowing text input for the expense note. The \\'Note\\' text field is located below the category selection. I will tap approximately at the center of the \\'Note\\' field, which is around [444, 502]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Note\\' text field at approximately [444, 502] was successful. The \\'Note\\' text field is now focused, as indicated by the cursor in the field and the updated XML data. The virtual keyboard is visible. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'Monthly recurring\\' into this field.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Monthly recurring\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Monthly recurring\\' into the currently focused \\'Note\\' text field. The field is currently empty or contains placeholder text. After this action, the \\'Note\\' field should contain \\'Monthly recurring\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Monthly recurring\\' into the \\'Note\\' text field was successful. The \\'Note\\' field now correctly displays \\'Monthly recurring\\', as confirmed by the second screenshot and the screen information text. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to tap the \\'SAVE\\' button.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[543,415],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button. The button is currently active and ready to be pressed. After this action, the expense \\'Legal Fees\\' should be saved, and the app will likely navigate back to the main expense list screen or a confirmation screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'SAVE\\' button was successful. The \\'Legal Fees\\' expense was saved, and the application navigated back to the \\'Home\\' screen. The \\'Legal Fees\\' expense (10.14 USD) is now visible in the list of recent expenses. This completes Subgoal 3. The agent is now ready to proceed with Subgoal 4.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[909,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'+\\' button to add a new expense. The button is located in the bottom right corner. After this action, the app should navigate to the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'+\\' button at [909, 893] was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Home\\' screen to the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen. This brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4, which is to add the \\'Stationery\\' expense.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 26: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16.

The field is currently empty. This action should focus the text field, allowing text input for the expense note. The \\'Note\\' text field is located below the category selection. I will tap approximately at the center of the \\'Note\\' field, which is around [444, 502]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Note\\' text field at approximately [444, 502] was successful. The \\'Note\\' text field is now focused, as indicated by the cursor in the field and the updated XML data. The virtual keyboard is visible. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'Monthly recurring\\' into this field.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Monthly recurring\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Monthly recurring\\' into the currently focused \\'Note\\' text field. The field is currently empty or contains placeholder text. After this action, the \\'Note\\' field should contain \\'Monthly recurring\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Monthly recurring\\' into the \\'Note\\' text field was successful. The \\'Note\\' field now correctly displays \\'Monthly recurring\\', as confirmed by the second screenshot and the screen information text. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to tap the \\'SAVE\\' button.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[543,415],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button. The button is currently active and ready to be pressed. After this action, the expense \\'Legal Fees\\' should be saved, and the app will likely navigate back to the main expense list screen or a confirmation screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'SAVE\\' button was successful. The \\'Legal Fees\\' expense was saved, and the application navigated back to the \\'Home\\' screen. The \\'Legal Fees\\' expense (10.14 USD) is now visible in the list of recent expenses. This completes Subgoal 3. The agent is now ready to proceed with Subgoal 4.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[909,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'+\\' button to add a new expense. The button is located in the bottom right corner. After this action, the app should navigate to the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'+\\' button at [909, 893] was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Home\\' screen to the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen. This brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4, which is to add the \\'Stationery\\' expense.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[190,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' text field. The field is currently empty and not focused. This action should focus the text field, allowing text input for the expense name. The keyboard should appear after this action. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Name\\' text field at [190, 500] was successful. The \\'Name\\' text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen, as indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' and confirmed by the screen information text. This brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4, which is to add the \\'Stationery\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'Stationery\\' into the \\'Name\\' field.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.47\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 107, 519], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0 IdY: 0.0 JXv: 0.0 Expense Entry 15 Oct 2023 3.47 PM\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [144, 88, 156, 164], \\'text\\': \\'Name\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [258, 88, 274, 250], \\'text\\': \\'Amount\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [327, 85, 344, 175], \\'text\\': \\'Food\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [328, 225, 344, 358], \\'text\\': \\'Income\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [323, 405, 349, 712], \\'text\\': \\'Housing Social\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [325, 763, 345, 987], \\'text\\': \\'Entertainmel\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [412, 87, 428, 171], \\'text\\': \\'Note\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [533, 372, 549, 471], \\'text\\': \\'SAVE\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [389, 55, 496, 947]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [518, 49, 567, 793]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [315, 390, 362, 571]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [315, 207, 362, 377]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [315, 584, 362, 731]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [315, 745, 363, 990]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [516, 816, 566, 947]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 819, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 897, 101, 985]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 783, 112, 869]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 195, 37, 241]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 904, 36, 945]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 141, 36, 188]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"1\", text=\"Name\", resource-id=\"com.arduia.expense:id/edt_name\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"com.arduia.expense\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[63,352][1017,504]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"Name\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The field is currently empty. This action should focus the text field, allowing text input for the expense note. The \\'Note\\' text field is located below the category selection. I will tap approximately at the center of the \\'Note\\' field, which is around [444, 502]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Note\\' text field at approximately [444, 502] was successful. The \\'Note\\' text field is now focused, as indicated by the cursor in the field and the updated XML data. The virtual keyboard is visible. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'Monthly recurring\\' into this field.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Monthly recurring\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Monthly recurring\\' into the currently focused \\'Note\\' text field. The field is currently empty or contains placeholder text. After this action, the \\'Note\\' field should contain \\'Monthly recurring\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Monthly recurring\\' into the \\'Note\\' text field was successful. The \\'Note\\' field now correctly displays \\'Monthly recurring\\', as confirmed by the second screenshot and the screen information text. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense. The next step is to tap the \\'SAVE\\' button.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[543,415],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button. The button is currently active and ready to be pressed. After this action, the expense \\'Legal Fees\\' should be saved, and the app will likely navigate back to the main expense list screen or a confirmation screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'SAVE\\' button was successful. The \\'Legal Fees\\' expense was saved, and the application navigated back to the \\'Home\\' screen. The \\'Legal Fees\\' expense (10.14 USD) is now visible in the list of recent expenses. This completes Subgoal 3. The agent is now ready to proceed with Subgoal 4.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

The button is located in the bottom right corner. After this action, the app should navigate to the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'+\\' button at [909, 893] was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Home\\' screen to the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen. This brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4, which is to add the \\'Stationery\\' expense.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

The field is currently empty and not focused. This action should focus the text field, allowing text input for the expense name. The keyboard should appear after this action. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Name\\' text field at [190, 500] was successful. The \\'Name\\' text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen, as indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' and confirmed by the screen information text. This brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4, which is to add the \\'Stationery\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'Stationery\\' into the \\'Name\\' field.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 27: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Stationery\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Stationery\\' into the currently focused \\'Name\\' text field.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 41, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.48\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 107, 519], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0 IdY: 0.0 JXv: 0.0 Expense Entry 15 Oct 2023 3.47 PM\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [144, 88, 156, 164], \\'text\\': \\'Name\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [164, 82, 195, 275], \\'text\\': \\'Stationery\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [259, 88, 277, 250], \\'text\\': \\'Amount\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [328, 85, 346, 175], \\'text\\': \\'Food\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [330, 225, 346, 358], \\'text\\': \\'Income\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [328, 408, 350, 712], \\'text\\': \\'Housing Social\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [327, 763, 347, 987], \\'text\\': \\'Entertainmei\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [413, 87, 430, 171], \\'text\\': \\'Note\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [535, 372, 550, 471], \\'text\\': \\'SAVE\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [391, 57, 498, 947]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [519, 49, 569, 792]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [317, 390, 364, 571]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [317, 208, 364, 377]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [317, 583, 364, 731]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [317, 745, 364, 989]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [518, 815, 569, 947]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 819, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 899, 101, 985]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 783, 110, 869]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 196, 37, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 141, 36, 188]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 904, 36, 945]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"0\", text=\"Stationery\", resource-id=\"com.arduia.expense:id/edt_name\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"com.arduia.expense\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[63,352][1017,509]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"Stationery\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

The field is currently empty or contains placeholder text. After this action, the \\'Note\\' field should contain \\'Monthly recurring\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Monthly recurring\\' into the \\'Note\\' text field was successful. The \\'Note\\' field now correctly displays \\'Monthly recurring\\', as confirmed by the second screenshot and the screen information text. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Legal Fees\\' expense.

Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Name\\' text field at [190, 500] was successful. The \\'Name\\' text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen, as indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' and confirmed by the screen information text. This brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4, which is to add the \\'Stationery\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'Stationery\\' into the \\'Name\\' field.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Stationery\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Stationery\\' into the currently focused \\'Name\\' text field.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The button is currently active and ready to be pressed. After this action, the expense \\'Legal Fees\\' should be saved, and the app will likely navigate back to the main expense list screen or a confirmation screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'SAVE\\' button was successful. The \\'Legal Fees\\' expense was saved, and the application navigated back to the \\'Home\\' screen. The \\'Legal Fees\\' expense (10.14 USD) is now visible in the list of recent expenses. This completes Subgoal 3. The agent is now ready to proceed with Subgoal 4.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[909,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'+\\' button to add a new expense. The button is located in the bottom right corner. After this action, the app should navigate to the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'+\\' button at [909, 893] was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Home\\' screen to the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen. This brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4, which is to add the \\'Stationery\\' expense.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[190,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' text field. The field is currently empty and not focused. This action should focus the text field, allowing text input for the expense name. The keyboard should appear after this action. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Name\\' text field at [190, 500] was successful. The \\'Name\\' text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen, as indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' and confirmed by the screen information text. This brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4, which is to add the \\'Stationery\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'Stationery\\' into the \\'Name\\' field.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Stationery\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Stationery\\' into the currently focused \\'Name\\' text field. The field is currently empty or contains placeholder text. After this action, the \\'Name\\' field should contain \\'Stationery\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Stationery\\' into the \\'Name\\' text field was successful. The \\'Name\\' field now correctly displays \\'Stationery\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Stationery\\' expense. The next step is to tap on the \\'Amount\\' text field.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

The field is currently empty and not focused. This action should focus the text field, allowing text input for the expense amount. The keyboard should remain open after this action. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Amount\\' text field at [268, 500] was successful. The \\'Amount\\' text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard remains open. This brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4, which is to add the \\'Stationery\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'118.93\\' into the \\'Amount\\' field.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 41, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.48\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 107, 519], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0 IdY: 0.0 JXv: 0.0 Expense Entry 15 Oct 2023 3.47 PM\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [144, 88, 156, 164], \\'text\\': \\'Name\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [165, 81, 190, 268], \\'text\\': \\'Stationery\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [232, 89, 245, 209], \\'text\\': \\'Amount\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [257, 833, 274, 913], \\'text\\': \\'USD\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [328, 85, 346, 175], \\'text\\': \\'Food\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [330, 225, 346, 358], \\'text\\': \\'Income\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [328, 408, 350, 712], \\'text\\': \\'Housing Social\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [327, 763, 347, 987], \\'text\\': \\'Entertainmei\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [413, 87, 430, 171], \\'text\\': \\'Note\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [535, 372, 550, 471], \\'text\\': \\'SAVE\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [391, 57, 498, 947]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [519, 49, 569, 793]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [317, 390, 364, 572]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [317, 207, 364, 378]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [317, 583, 364, 731]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [317, 745, 365, 991]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [518, 815, 569, 947]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 820, 35, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 782, 111, 869]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 905, 35, 944]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 897, 102, 986]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 196, 37, 241]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 141, 36, 188]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"2\", text=\"Amount\", resource-id=\"com.arduia.expense:id/edt_amount\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"com.arduia.expense\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[63,565][1017,720]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"Amount\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13.

If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The button is currently active and ready to be pressed. After this action, the expense \\'Legal Fees\\' should be saved, and the app will likely navigate back to the main expense list screen or a confirmation screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'SAVE\\' button was successful. The \\'Legal Fees\\' expense was saved, and the application navigated back to the \\'Home\\' screen. The \\'Legal Fees\\' expense (10.14 USD) is now visible in the list of recent expenses. This completes Subgoal 3. The agent is now ready to proceed with Subgoal 4.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[909,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'+\\' button to add a new expense. The button is located in the bottom right corner. After this action, the app should navigate to the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'+\\' button at [909, 893] was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Home\\' screen to the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen. This brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4, which is to add the \\'Stationery\\' expense.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[190,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' text field. The field is currently empty and not focused. This action should focus the text field, allowing text input for the expense name. The keyboard should appear after this action. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Name\\' text field at [190, 500] was successful. The \\'Name\\' text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen, as indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' and confirmed by the screen information text. This brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4, which is to add the \\'Stationery\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'Stationery\\' into the \\'Name\\' field.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Stationery\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Stationery\\' into the currently focused \\'Name\\' text field. The field is currently empty or contains placeholder text. After this action, the \\'Name\\' field should contain \\'Stationery\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Stationery\\' into the \\'Name\\' text field was successful. The \\'Name\\' field now correctly displays \\'Stationery\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Stationery\\' expense. The next step is to tap on the \\'Amount\\' text field.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Amount\\' text field. The field is currently empty and not focused. This action should focus the text field, allowing text input for the expense amount. The keyboard should remain open after this action. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Amount\\' text field at [268, 500] was successful. The \\'Amount\\' text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard remains open. This brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4, which is to add the \\'Stationery\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'118.93\\' into the \\'Amount\\' field.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 29: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"118.93\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'118.93\\' into the currently focused \\'Amount\\' text field.

Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"118.93\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right.

The field is currently empty or contains placeholder text. After this action, the \\'Name\\' field should contain \\'Stationery\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Stationery\\' into the \\'Name\\' text field was successful. The \\'Name\\' field now correctly displays \\'Stationery\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Stationery\\' expense. The next step is to tap on the \\'Amount\\' text field.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

The field is currently empty and not focused. This action should focus the text field, allowing text input for the expense amount. The keyboard should remain open after this action. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Amount\\' text field at [268, 500] was successful. The \\'Amount\\' text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard remains open. This brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4, which is to add the \\'Stationery\\' expense.

The field is currently empty or contains placeholder text. After this action, the \\'Amount\\' field should contain \\'118.93\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'118.93\\' into the \\'Amount\\' text field was successful. The \\'Amount\\' field now correctly displays \\'118.93\\'. The field remains focused, and the keyboard is still active. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Stationery\\' expense.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The field is currently empty and not focused. This action should focus the text field, allowing text input for the expense name. The keyboard should appear after this action. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Name\\' text field at [190, 500] was successful. The \\'Name\\' text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen, as indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' and confirmed by the screen information text. This brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4, which is to add the \\'Stationery\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'Stationery\\' into the \\'Name\\' field.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Stationery\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Stationery\\' into the currently focused \\'Name\\' text field. The field is currently empty or contains placeholder text. After this action, the \\'Name\\' field should contain \\'Stationery\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Stationery\\' into the \\'Name\\' text field was successful. The \\'Name\\' field now correctly displays \\'Stationery\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Stationery\\' expense. The next step is to tap on the \\'Amount\\' text field.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Amount\\' text field. The field is currently empty and not focused. This action should focus the text field, allowing text input for the expense amount. The keyboard should remain open after this action. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Amount\\' text field at [268, 500] was successful. The \\'Amount\\' text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard remains open. This brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4, which is to add the \\'Stationery\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'118.93\\' into the \\'Amount\\' field.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"118.93\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'118.93\\' into the currently focused \\'Amount\\' text field. The field is currently empty or contains placeholder text. After this action, the \\'Amount\\' field should contain \\'118.93\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'118.93\\' into the \\'Amount\\' text field was successful. The \\'Amount\\' field now correctly displays \\'118.93\\'. The field remains focused, and the keyboard is still active. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Stationery\\' expense. The next steps involve selecting the category, entering the note, and saving the expense.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[336,870],\"end_point\":[336,130],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left on the category list, starting from the \\'Entertainmei\\' category (around [336, 870]) and ending near the \\'Food\\' category (around [336, 130]). This action is intended to reveal more categories, including \\'Others\\'. After this action, the \\'Others\\' category should be visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the category list to the left. The categories \\'Transportation\\', \\'Clothes\\', and \\'Health Care\\' are now visible. The \\'Others\\' category, which is the target, is still not visible. The action was partially successful as it moved the list, but it did not reveal the desired category. The focused text field remains the \\'Amount\\' field. Another swipe is needed to find the \\'Others\\' category.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"118.93\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen.

Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The field is currently empty and not focused. This action should focus the text field, allowing text input for the expense amount. The keyboard should remain open after this action. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Amount\\' text field at [268, 500] was successful. The \\'Amount\\' text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard remains open. This brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4, which is to add the \\'Stationery\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'118.93\\' into the \\'Amount\\' field.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"118.93\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'118.93\\' into the currently focused \\'Amount\\' text field. The field is currently empty or contains placeholder text. After this action, the \\'Amount\\' field should contain \\'118.93\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'118.93\\' into the \\'Amount\\' text field was successful. The \\'Amount\\' field now correctly displays \\'118.93\\'. The field remains focused, and the keyboard is still active. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Stationery\\' expense.

This action is intended to reveal more categories, including \\'Others\\'. After this action, the \\'Others\\' category should be visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the category list to the left. The categories \\'Transportation\\', \\'Clothes\\', and \\'Health Care\\' are now visible. The \\'Others\\' category, which is the target, is still not visible. The action was partially successful as it moved the list, but it did not reveal the desired category. The focused text field remains the \\'Amount\\' field.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is intended to reveal more categories, including \\'Others\\'. After this action, the \\'Others\\' category should be visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the category list to the left. The categories \\'Transportation\\', \\'Clothes\\', and \\'Health Care\\' are now visible. The \\'Others\\' category, which is the target, is still not visible. The action was partially successful as it moved the list, but it did not reveal the desired category.

Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text.

It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is intended to reveal more categories, including \\'Others\\'. After this action, the \\'Others\\' category should be visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the category list to the left. The categories \\'Transportation\\', \\'Clothes\\', and \\'Health Care\\' are now visible. The \\'Others\\' category, which is the target, is still not visible. The action was partially successful as it moved the list, but it did not reveal the desired category.

Another swipe is needed to find the \\'Others\\' category.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[337,887],\"end_point\":[337,130],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left on the category list, starting from the center of the \\'Health Care\\' category (around [337, 887]) and ending near the left edge of the screen (around [337, 130]). This action is intended to reveal more categories, including \\'Others\\'. After this action, the \\'Others\\' category should be visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the category list further to the left. As a result, the \\'Others\\' category is now visible on the screen. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Stationery\\' expense. The focused text field remains the \\'Amount\\' field.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 32: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Amount\\' text field at [268, 500] was successful. The \\'Amount\\' text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard remains open. This brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4, which is to add the \\'Stationery\\' expense.

The field is currently empty or contains placeholder text. After this action, the \\'Amount\\' field should contain \\'118.93\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'118.93\\' into the \\'Amount\\' text field was successful. The \\'Amount\\' field now correctly displays \\'118.93\\'. The field remains focused, and the keyboard is still active. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Stationery\\' expense.

This action is intended to reveal more categories, including \\'Others\\'. After this action, the \\'Others\\' category should be visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the category list to the left. The categories \\'Transportation\\', \\'Clothes\\', and \\'Health Care\\' are now visible. The \\'Others\\' category, which is the target, is still not visible. The action was partially successful as it moved the list, but it did not reveal the desired category.

The text you can edit is: \"118.93\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"118.93\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nAdd the following expenses into the pro expense:\\nExpense: Social Club Dues\\n amount_dollars: $67.41\\n category_name: Social\\n note: Monthly recurring\\n\\nExpense: Legal Fees\\n amount_dollars: $10.14\\n category_name: Others\\n note: Monthly recurring\\n\\nExpense: Stationery\\n amount_dollars: $118.93\\n category_name: Others\\n note: Remember to transfer funds\\n\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Amount\\' text field. The field is currently empty and not focused. This action should focus the text field, allowing text input for the expense amount. The keyboard should remain open after this action. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Amount\\' text field at [268, 500] was successful. The \\'Amount\\' text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard remains open. This brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4, which is to add the \\'Stationery\\' expense. The next step is to input \\'118.93\\' into the \\'Amount\\' field.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"118.93\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'118.93\\' into the currently focused \\'Amount\\' text field. The field is currently empty or contains placeholder text. After this action, the \\'Amount\\' field should contain \\'118.93\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'118.93\\' into the \\'Amount\\' text field was successful. The \\'Amount\\' field now correctly displays \\'118.93\\'. The field remains focused, and the keyboard is still active. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Stationery\\' expense. The next steps involve selecting the category, entering the note, and saving the expense.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[336,870],\"end_point\":[336,130],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left on the category list, starting from the \\'Entertainmei\\' category (around [336, 870]) and ending near the \\'Food\\' category (around [336, 130]). This action is intended to reveal more categories, including \\'Others\\'. After this action, the \\'Others\\' category should be visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the category list to the left. The categories \\'Transportation\\', \\'Clothes\\', and \\'Health Care\\' are now visible. The \\'Others\\' category, which is the target, is still not visible. The action was partially successful as it moved the list, but it did not reveal the desired category. The focused text field remains the \\'Amount\\' field. Another swipe is needed to find the \\'Others\\' category.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[337,887],\"end_point\":[337,130],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left on the category list, starting from the center of the \\'Health Care\\' category (around [337, 887]) and ending near the left edge of the screen (around [337, 130]). This action is intended to reveal more categories, including \\'Others\\'. After this action, the \\'Others\\' category should be visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the category list further to the left. As a result, the \\'Others\\' category is now visible on the screen. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Stationery\\' expense. The focused text field remains the \\'Amount\\' field.\\n Step 32: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[337,856],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Others\\' category button. The button is currently not selected. After this action, the \\'Others\\' category should be selected, and the button\\'s appearance might change to indicate selection. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Others\\' category button at [337, 856] did not result in a visible change on the screen, suggesting that the \\'Others\\' category was not successfully selected. The \\'Amount\\' text field remains focused. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the category selection is a necessary step. The next step should be to try tapping the \\'Others\\' category button again, ensuring it is properly selected before proceeding.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 33: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[340,857],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Others\\' category button again. The button is currently not visually selected. This action should select the \\'Others\\' category. The appearance of the button might change to indicate selection, or the selection might be internal without immediate visual feedback until another element is interacted with. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open \\'pro expense\\' App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'pro expense\\' app is open and its main screen is visible.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The field is currently empty or contains placeholder text. After this action, the \\'Amount\\' field should contain \\'118.93\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'118.93\\' into the \\'Amount\\' text field was successful. The \\'Amount\\' field now correctly displays \\'118.93\\'. The field remains focused, and the keyboard is still active. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Stationery\\' expense. The next steps involve selecting the category, entering the note, and saving the expense.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[336,870],\"end_point\":[336,130],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left on the category list, starting from the \\'Entertainmei\\' category (around [336, 870]) and ending near the \\'Food\\' category (around [336, 130]). This action is intended to reveal more categories, including \\'Others\\'. After this action, the \\'Others\\' category should be visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the category list to the left. The categories \\'Transportation\\', \\'Clothes\\', and \\'Health Care\\' are now visible. The \\'Others\\' category, which is the target, is still not visible. The action was partially successful as it moved the list, but it did not reveal the desired category. The focused text field remains the \\'Amount\\' field. Another swipe is needed to find the \\'Others\\' category.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[337,887],\"end_point\":[337,130],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left on the category list, starting from the center of the \\'Health Care\\' category (around [337, 887]) and ending near the left edge of the screen (around [337, 130]). This action is intended to reveal more categories, including \\'Others\\'. After this action, the \\'Others\\' category should be visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the category list further to the left. As a result, the \\'Others\\' category is now visible on the screen. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Stationery\\' expense. The focused text field remains the \\'Amount\\' field.\\n Step 32: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[337,856],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Others\\' category button. The button is currently not selected. After this action, the \\'Others\\' category should be selected, and the button\\'s appearance might change to indicate selection. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Others\\' category button at [337, 856] did not result in a visible change on the screen, suggesting that the \\'Others\\' category was not successfully selected. The \\'Amount\\' text field remains focused. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the category selection is a necessary step. The next step should be to try tapping the \\'Others\\' category button again, ensuring it is properly selected before proceeding.\\n Step 33: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[340,857],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Others\\' category button again. The button is currently not visually selected. This action should select the \\'Others\\' category. The appearance of the button might change to indicate selection, or the selection might be internal without immediate visual feedback until another element is interacted with. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap the \\'Others\\' category button at [340, 857]. There was no visible change on the screen after the tap. The \\'Others\\' button already had a blue background, which suggests it was, and remains, selected. The \\'Amount\\' text field is still the focused element. Assuming the \\'Others\\' category is selected based on its appearance, the agent is on track to complete the subgoal. The next step is to tap the \\'Note\\' field to input the note.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"118.93\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The field is currently empty or contains placeholder text. After this action, the \\'Amount\\' field should contain \\'118.93\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'118.93\\' into the \\'Amount\\' text field was successful. The \\'Amount\\' field now correctly displays \\'118.93\\'. The field remains focused, and the keyboard is still active. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Stationery\\' expense. The next steps involve selecting the category, entering the note, and saving the expense.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[336,870],\"end_point\":[336,130],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left on the category list, starting from the \\'Entertainmei\\' category (around [336, 870]) and ending near the \\'Food\\' category (around [336, 130]). This action is intended to reveal more categories, including \\'Others\\'. After this action, the \\'Others\\' category should be visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the category list to the left. The categories \\'Transportation\\', \\'Clothes\\', and \\'Health Care\\' are now visible. The \\'Others\\' category, which is the target, is still not visible. The action was partially successful as it moved the list, but it did not reveal the desired category. The focused text field remains the \\'Amount\\' field. Another swipe is needed to find the \\'Others\\' category.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[337,887],\"end_point\":[337,130],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left on the category list, starting from the center of the \\'Health Care\\' category (around [337, 887]) and ending near the left edge of the screen (around [337, 130]). This action is intended to reveal more categories, including \\'Others\\'. After this action, the \\'Others\\' category should be visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the category list further to the left. As a result, the \\'Others\\' category is now visible on the screen. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Stationery\\' expense. The focused text field remains the \\'Amount\\' field.\\n Step 32: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[337,856],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Others\\' category button. The button is currently not selected. After this action, the \\'Others\\' category should be selected, and the button\\'s appearance might change to indicate selection. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Others\\' category button at [337, 856] did not result in a visible change on the screen, suggesting that the \\'Others\\' category was not successfully selected. The \\'Amount\\' text field remains focused. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the category selection is a necessary step. The next step should be to try tapping the \\'Others\\' category button again, ensuring it is properly selected before proceeding.\\n Step 33: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[340,857],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Others\\' category button again. The button is currently not visually selected. This action should select the \\'Others\\' category. The appearance of the button might change to indicate selection, or the selection might be internal without immediate visual feedback until another element is interacted with. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap the \\'Others\\' category button at [340, 857]. There was no visible change on the screen after the tap. The \\'Others\\' button already had a blue background, which suggests it was, and remains, selected. The \\'Amount\\' text field is still the focused element. Assuming the \\'Others\\' category is selected based on its appearance, the agent is on track to complete the subgoal. The next step is to tap the \\'Note\\' field to input the note.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 34: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is intended to reveal more categories, including \\'Others\\'. After this action, the \\'Others\\' category should be visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the category list to the left. The categories \\'Transportation\\', \\'Clothes\\', and \\'Health Care\\' are now visible. The \\'Others\\' category, which is the target, is still not visible. The action was partially successful as it moved the list, but it did not reveal the desired category. The focused text field remains the \\'Amount\\' field. Another swipe is needed to find the \\'Others\\' category.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[337,887],\"end_point\":[337,130],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left on the category list, starting from the center of the \\'Health Care\\' category (around [337, 887]) and ending near the left edge of the screen (around [337, 130]). This action is intended to reveal more categories, including \\'Others\\'. After this action, the \\'Others\\' category should be visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the category list further to the left. As a result, the \\'Others\\' category is now visible on the screen. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Stationery\\' expense. The focused text field remains the \\'Amount\\' field.\\n Step 32: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[337,856],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Others\\' category button. The button is currently not selected. After this action, the \\'Others\\' category should be selected, and the button\\'s appearance might change to indicate selection. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Others\\' category button at [337, 856] did not result in a visible change on the screen, suggesting that the \\'Others\\' category was not successfully selected. The \\'Amount\\' text field remains focused. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the category selection is a necessary step. The next step should be to try tapping the \\'Others\\' category button again, ensuring it is properly selected before proceeding.\\n Step 33: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[340,857],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Others\\' category button again. The button is currently not visually selected. This action should select the \\'Others\\' category. The appearance of the button might change to indicate selection, or the selection might be internal without immediate visual feedback until another element is interacted with. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap the \\'Others\\' category button at [340, 857]. There was no visible change on the screen after the tap. The \\'Others\\' button already had a blue background, which suggests it was, and remains, selected. The \\'Amount\\' text field is still the focused element. Assuming the \\'Others\\' category is selected based on its appearance, the agent is on track to complete the subgoal. The next step is to tap the \\'Note\\' field to input the note.\\n Step 34: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[445,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Note\\' text field. The \\'Note\\' field is currently empty and not focused. After this action, the \\'Note\\' field should be focused, and the keyboard should be ready for text input. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Note\\' text field at [445, 500] was successful. The \\'Note\\' text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard is active, ready for text input. The placeholder text \\'Note\\' is visible in the field. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Stationery\\' expense.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"Note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is intended to reveal more categories, including \\'Others\\'. After this action, the \\'Others\\' category should be visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the category list to the left. The categories \\'Transportation\\', \\'Clothes\\', and \\'Health Care\\' are now visible. The \\'Others\\' category, which is the target, is still not visible. The action was partially successful as it moved the list, but it did not reveal the desired category. The focused text field remains the \\'Amount\\' field. Another swipe is needed to find the \\'Others\\' category.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[337,887],\"end_point\":[337,130],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left on the category list, starting from the center of the \\'Health Care\\' category (around [337, 887]) and ending near the left edge of the screen (around [337, 130]). This action is intended to reveal more categories, including \\'Others\\'. After this action, the \\'Others\\' category should be visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the category list further to the left. As a result, the \\'Others\\' category is now visible on the screen. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Stationery\\' expense. The focused text field remains the \\'Amount\\' field.\\n Step 32: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[337,856],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Others\\' category button. The button is currently not selected. After this action, the \\'Others\\' category should be selected, and the button\\'s appearance might change to indicate selection. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Others\\' category button at [337, 856] did not result in a visible change on the screen, suggesting that the \\'Others\\' category was not successfully selected. The \\'Amount\\' text field remains focused. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the category selection is a necessary step. The next step should be to try tapping the \\'Others\\' category button again, ensuring it is properly selected before proceeding.\\n Step 33: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[340,857],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Others\\' category button again. The button is currently not visually selected. This action should select the \\'Others\\' category. The appearance of the button might change to indicate selection, or the selection might be internal without immediate visual feedback until another element is interacted with. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap the \\'Others\\' category button at [340, 857]. There was no visible change on the screen after the tap. The \\'Others\\' button already had a blue background, which suggests it was, and remains, selected. The \\'Amount\\' text field is still the focused element. Assuming the \\'Others\\' category is selected based on its appearance, the agent is on track to complete the subgoal. The next step is to tap the \\'Note\\' field to input the note.\\n Step 34: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[445,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Note\\' text field. The \\'Note\\' field is currently empty and not focused. After this action, the \\'Note\\' field should be focused, and the keyboard should be ready for text input. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Note\\' text field at [445, 500] was successful. The \\'Note\\' text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard is active, ready for text input. The placeholder text \\'Note\\' is visible in the field. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Stationery\\' expense.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 35: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Remember to transfer funds\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Remember to transfer funds\\' into the focused \\'Note\\' text field. The \\'Note\\' field is currently focused and contains placeholder text \\'Note\\'. After this action, the \\'Note\\' field should contain \\'Remember to transfer funds\\'.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is intended to reveal more categories, including \\'Others\\'. After this action, the \\'Others\\' category should be visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the category list further to the left. As a result, the \\'Others\\' category is now visible on the screen. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Stationery\\' expense. The focused text field remains the \\'Amount\\' field.\\n Step 32: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[337,856],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Others\\' category button. The button is currently not selected. After this action, the \\'Others\\' category should be selected, and the button\\'s appearance might change to indicate selection. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Others\\' category button at [337, 856] did not result in a visible change on the screen, suggesting that the \\'Others\\' category was not successfully selected. The \\'Amount\\' text field remains focused. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the category selection is a necessary step. The next step should be to try tapping the \\'Others\\' category button again, ensuring it is properly selected before proceeding.\\n Step 33: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[340,857],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Others\\' category button again. The button is currently not visually selected. This action should select the \\'Others\\' category. The appearance of the button might change to indicate selection, or the selection might be internal without immediate visual feedback until another element is interacted with. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap the \\'Others\\' category button at [340, 857]. There was no visible change on the screen after the tap. The \\'Others\\' button already had a blue background, which suggests it was, and remains, selected. The \\'Amount\\' text field is still the focused element. Assuming the \\'Others\\' category is selected based on its appearance, the agent is on track to complete the subgoal. The next step is to tap the \\'Note\\' field to input the note.\\n Step 34: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[445,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Note\\' text field. The \\'Note\\' field is currently empty and not focused. After this action, the \\'Note\\' field should be focused, and the keyboard should be ready for text input. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Note\\' text field at [445, 500] was successful. The \\'Note\\' text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard is active, ready for text input. The placeholder text \\'Note\\' is visible in the field. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Stationery\\' expense.\\n Step 35: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Remember to transfer funds\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Remember to transfer funds\\' into the focused \\'Note\\' text field. The \\'Note\\' field is currently focused and contains placeholder text \\'Note\\'. After this action, the \\'Note\\' field should contain \\'Remember to transfer funds\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Remember to transfer funds\\' into the \\'Note\\' text field was successful. The text is now present in the \\'Note\\' field as intended. The \\'Note\\' field remains focused, and the keyboard is still active. This action directly contributes to completing the current subgoal of adding the \\'Stationery\\' expense.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is intended to reveal more categories, including \\'Others\\'. After this action, the \\'Others\\' category should be visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the category list further to the left. As a result, the \\'Others\\' category is now visible on the screen. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Stationery\\' expense. The focused text field remains the \\'Amount\\' field.\\n Step 32: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[337,856],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Others\\' category button. The button is currently not selected. After this action, the \\'Others\\' category should be selected, and the button\\'s appearance might change to indicate selection. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Others\\' category button at [337, 856] did not result in a visible change on the screen, suggesting that the \\'Others\\' category was not successfully selected. The \\'Amount\\' text field remains focused. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the category selection is a necessary step. The next step should be to try tapping the \\'Others\\' category button again, ensuring it is properly selected before proceeding.\\n Step 33: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[340,857],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Others\\' category button again. The button is currently not visually selected. This action should select the \\'Others\\' category. The appearance of the button might change to indicate selection, or the selection might be internal without immediate visual feedback until another element is interacted with. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap the \\'Others\\' category button at [340, 857]. There was no visible change on the screen after the tap. The \\'Others\\' button already had a blue background, which suggests it was, and remains, selected. The \\'Amount\\' text field is still the focused element. Assuming the \\'Others\\' category is selected based on its appearance, the agent is on track to complete the subgoal. The next step is to tap the \\'Note\\' field to input the note.\\n Step 34: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[445,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Note\\' text field. The \\'Note\\' field is currently empty and not focused. After this action, the \\'Note\\' field should be focused, and the keyboard should be ready for text input. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Note\\' text field at [445, 500] was successful. The \\'Note\\' text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard is active, ready for text input. The placeholder text \\'Note\\' is visible in the field. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Stationery\\' expense.\\n Step 35: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Remember to transfer funds\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Remember to transfer funds\\' into the focused \\'Note\\' text field. The \\'Note\\' field is currently focused and contains placeholder text \\'Note\\'. After this action, the \\'Note\\' field should contain \\'Remember to transfer funds\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Remember to transfer funds\\' into the \\'Note\\' text field was successful. The text is now present in the \\'Note\\' field as intended.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The button is currently not selected. After this action, the \\'Others\\' category should be selected, and the button\\'s appearance might change to indicate selection. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Others\\' category button at [337, 856] did not result in a visible change on the screen, suggesting that the \\'Others\\' category was not successfully selected. The \\'Amount\\' text field remains focused. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the category selection is a necessary step. The next step should be to try tapping the \\'Others\\' category button again, ensuring it is properly selected before proceeding.\\n Step 33: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[340,857],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Others\\' category button again. The button is currently not visually selected. This action should select the \\'Others\\' category. The appearance of the button might change to indicate selection, or the selection might be internal without immediate visual feedback until another element is interacted with. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap the \\'Others\\' category button at [340, 857]. There was no visible change on the screen after the tap. The \\'Others\\' button already had a blue background, which suggests it was, and remains, selected. The \\'Amount\\' text field is still the focused element. Assuming the \\'Others\\' category is selected based on its appearance, the agent is on track to complete the subgoal. The next step is to tap the \\'Note\\' field to input the note.\\n Step 34: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[445,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Note\\' text field. The \\'Note\\' field is currently empty and not focused. After this action, the \\'Note\\' field should be focused, and the keyboard should be ready for text input. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Note\\' text field at [445, 500] was successful. The \\'Note\\' text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard is active, ready for text input. The placeholder text \\'Note\\' is visible in the field. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the \\'Stationery\\' expense.\\n Step 35: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Remember to transfer funds\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Remember to transfer funds\\' into the focused \\'Note\\' text field. The \\'Note\\' field is currently focused and contains placeholder text \\'Note\\'. After this action, the \\'Note\\' field should contain \\'Remember to transfer funds\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Remember to transfer funds\\' into the \\'Note\\' text field was successful. The text is now present in the \\'Note\\' field as intended. The \\'Note\\' field remains focused, and the keyboard is still active. This action directly contributes to completing the current subgoal of adding the \\'Stationery\\' expense.\\n Step 36: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[542,421],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button. The \\'SAVE\\' button is currently visible and enabled. After this action, the expense should be saved, and the app should likely return to the main expense list screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'SAVE\\' button at [542,421] was successful. The \\'Stationery\\' expense was saved, and the application returned to the \\'Home\\' screen. The \\'Stationery\\' expense, with the amount 118.93 USD, is now visible in the \\'Recent\\' expenses list on the \\'Home\\' screen. This action successfully completed the addition of the third expense and brought the agent to the completion of Subgoal 4.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",
