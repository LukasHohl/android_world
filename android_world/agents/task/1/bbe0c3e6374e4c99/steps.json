Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The current screen is the home screen. This action is predicted to reveal the app drawer, where the Markor app can be found. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Markor application.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[866,620],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon at [866, 620] to open the application. The Markor app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. This action is predicted to launch the Markor application. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Markor\\' app icon was successful. The Markor application launched, and its file browser interface is now visible, showing the \\'my_expenses.txt\\' file. This completes the first subgoal and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.35\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [74, 38, 96, 203], \\'text\\': \\'Markor\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 728, 95, 888], \\'text\\': \\'= Q\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [143, 140, 166, 688], \\'text\\': \\'Istorage/emulated/0/Documents\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 143, 223, 504], \\'text\\': \\'my_expenses.txt 5/13/2025, 18.26\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [950, 85, 966, 163], \\'text\\': \\'Files\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [951, 332, 966, 417], \\'text\\': \\'To-Do\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 553, 966, 699], \\'text\\': \\'QuickNote\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 840, 966, 913], \\'text\\': \\'More\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [833, 819, 896, 968]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 494, 974, 758]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 0, 974, 257]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 253, 974, 499]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 823, 37, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 909, 100, 984]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 712, 99, 794]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 836, 972, 914]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 813, 103, 896]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 905, 37, 942]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 38, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 617, 106, 703]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [984, 363, 1000, 634]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Log the reimbursable transactions in the pro expense.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 3 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,540],\"end_point\":[400,540],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [900, 540] to [400, 540] to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. This action is predicted to reveal the app drawer, where the Markor app can be found. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Markor application.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[866,620],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon at [866, 620] to open the application. The Markor app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. This action is predicted to launch the Markor application. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Markor\\' app icon was successful. The Markor application launched, and its file browser interface is now visible, showing the \\'my_expenses.txt\\' file. This completes the first subgoal and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[201,324],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'my_expenses.txt\\' file entry at approximately [201, 324] to open it. The file \\'my_expenses.txt\\' is currently listed in the Markor file browser. This action is predicted to open the file and display its content. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'my_expenses.txt\\' was successful. The file opened, and its content is now displayed on the screen. This directly led to the completion of the primary objective of the active subgoal (opening the file). The content of the file is now available for extraction and storage in the Agent Memory.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 3: {\"name\":\"Makes the agent wait for 10 seconds. Use this if a page is not loaded.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: The agent will wait for 10 seconds. This action is chosen because the current task is to process information already in memory (extracting reimbursable transactions). No direct UI interaction is needed for this specific extraction step. During this \\'wait\\' period, the agent\\'s internal state will be updated by storing the identified reimbursable transaction(s) in the `ExtractedReimbursableTransactions` memory entry. The screen will remain unchanged, showing the content of \\'my_expenses.txt\\'.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The Markor app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. This action is predicted to launch the Markor application. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Markor\\' app icon was successful. The Markor application launched, and its file browser interface is now visible, showing the \\'my_expenses.txt\\' file. This completes the first subgoal and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[201,324],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'my_expenses.txt\\' file entry at approximately [201, 324] to open it. The file \\'my_expenses.txt\\' is currently listed in the Markor file browser. This action is predicted to open the file and display its content. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'my_expenses.txt\\' was successful. The file opened, and its content is now displayed on the screen. This directly led to the completion of the primary objective of the active subgoal (opening the file). The content of the file is now available for extraction and storage in the Agent Memory.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Makes the agent wait for 10 seconds. Use this if a page is not loaded.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: The agent will wait for 10 seconds. This action is chosen because the current task is to process information already in memory (extracting reimbursable transactions). No direct UI interaction is needed for this specific extraction step. During this \\'wait\\' period, the agent\\'s internal state will be updated by storing the identified reimbursable transaction(s) in the `ExtractedReimbursableTransactions` memory entry. The screen will remain unchanged, showing the content of \\'my_expenses.txt\\'. Actual Outcome: The \\'WAIT\\' action completed successfully. It did not change the screen, which remained on the \\'my_expenses.txt\\' file content. During this wait period, the agent (myself) analyzed the content of \\'MyExpensesFileContent\\'. One reimbursable transaction was identified: \"Car Insurance|$303.01|Transportation\". This information will be stored in the \\'ExtractedReimbursableTransactions\\' memory entry. The action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully extracting the necessary information.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Log the reimbursable transactions in the pro expense.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 4 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,540],\"end_point\":[400,540],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [900, 540] to [400, 540] to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. This action is predicted to reveal the app drawer, where the Markor app can be found. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Markor application.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[866,620],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon at [866, 620] to open the application. The Markor app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. This action is predicted to launch the Markor application. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Markor\\' app icon was successful. The Markor application launched, and its file browser interface is now visible, showing the \\'my_expenses.txt\\' file. This completes the first subgoal and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[201,324],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'my_expenses.txt\\' file entry at approximately [201, 324] to open it. The file \\'my_expenses.txt\\' is currently listed in the Markor file browser. This action is predicted to open the file and display its content. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'my_expenses.txt\\' was successful. The file opened, and its content is now displayed on the screen. This directly led to the completion of the primary objective of the active subgoal (opening the file). The content of the file is now available for extraction and storage in the Agent Memory.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Makes the agent wait for 10 seconds. Use this if a page is not loaded.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: The agent will wait for 10 seconds. This action is chosen because the current task is to process information already in memory (extracting reimbursable transactions). No direct UI interaction is needed for this specific extraction step. During this \\'wait\\' period, the agent\\'s internal state will be updated by storing the identified reimbursable transaction(s) in the `ExtractedReimbursableTransactions` memory entry. The screen will remain unchanged, showing the content of \\'my_expenses.txt\\'. Actual Outcome: The \\'WAIT\\' action completed successfully. It did not change the screen, which remained on the \\'my_expenses.txt\\' file content. During this wait period, the agent (myself) analyzed the content of \\'MyExpensesFileContent\\'. One reimbursable transaction was identified: \"Car Insurance|$303.01|Transportation\". This information will be stored in the \\'ExtractedReimbursableTransactions\\' memory entry. The action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully extracting the necessary information.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 4: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button to navigate from the currently open \\'my_expenses.txt\\' file back to the Markor file browser. This will allow me to search for a \\'pro expense\\' file or folder within Markor. The screen currently shows the content of \\'my_expenses.txt\\'.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The Markor application launched, and its file browser interface is now visible, showing the \\'my_expenses.txt\\' file. This completes the first subgoal and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[201,324],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'my_expenses.txt\\' file entry at approximately [201, 324] to open it. The file \\'my_expenses.txt\\' is currently listed in the Markor file browser. This action is predicted to open the file and display its content. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'my_expenses.txt\\' was successful. The file opened, and its content is now displayed on the screen. This directly led to the completion of the primary objective of the active subgoal (opening the file). The content of the file is now available for extraction and storage in the Agent Memory.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Makes the agent wait for 10 seconds. Use this if a page is not loaded.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: The agent will wait for 10 seconds. This action is chosen because the current task is to process information already in memory (extracting reimbursable transactions). No direct UI interaction is needed for this specific extraction step. During this \\'wait\\' period, the agent\\'s internal state will be updated by storing the identified reimbursable transaction(s) in the `ExtractedReimbursableTransactions` memory entry. The screen will remain unchanged, showing the content of \\'my_expenses.txt\\'. Actual Outcome: The \\'WAIT\\' action completed successfully. It did not change the screen, which remained on the \\'my_expenses.txt\\' file content. During this wait period, the agent (myself) analyzed the content of \\'MyExpensesFileContent\\'. One reimbursable transaction was identified: \"Car Insurance|$303.01|Transportation\". This information will be stored in the \\'ExtractedReimbursableTransactions\\' memory entry. The action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully extracting the necessary information.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button to navigate from the currently open \\'my_expenses.txt\\' file back to the Markor file browser. This will allow me to search for a \\'pro expense\\' file or folder within Markor. The screen currently shows the content of \\'my_expenses.txt\\'. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully navigated from the content view of \\'my_expenses.txt\\' back to the Markor file browser. The screen now displays the file list within Markor. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal (ID 4) by enabling the search for \\'pro expense\\' within the Markor application.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.38\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [74, 38, 96, 203], \\'text\\': \\'Markor\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 728, 95, 888], \\'text\\': \\'= Q\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [143, 140, 166, 688], \\'text\\': \\'Istorage/emulated/0/Documents\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 143, 223, 504], \\'text\\': \\'my_expenses.txt 5/13/2025, 18.26\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [950, 85, 966, 163], \\'text\\': \\'Files\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [951, 332, 966, 417], \\'text\\': \\'To-Do\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 553, 966, 699], \\'text\\': \\'QuickNote\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 840, 966, 913], \\'text\\': \\'More\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [833, 819, 896, 968]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 494, 973, 757]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 0, 974, 257]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 254, 974, 498]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 823, 37, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 909, 100, 984]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 712, 99, 794]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [912, 756, 974, 998]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 813, 103, 896]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 905, 37, 942]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 38, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 617, 106, 703]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [985, 363, 1000, 634]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 45, 38, 190]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Log the reimbursable transactions in the pro expense.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,540],\"end_point\":[400,540],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [900, 540] to [400, 540] to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. This action is predicted to reveal the app drawer, where the Markor app can be found. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Markor application.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[866,620],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon at [866, 620] to open the application. The Markor app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. This action is predicted to launch the Markor application. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Markor\\' app icon was successful. The Markor application launched, and its file browser interface is now visible, showing the \\'my_expenses.txt\\' file. This completes the first subgoal and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[201,324],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'my_expenses.txt\\' file entry at approximately [201, 324] to open it. The file \\'my_expenses.txt\\' is currently listed in the Markor file browser. This action is predicted to open the file and display its content. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'my_expenses.txt\\' was successful. The file opened, and its content is now displayed on the screen. This directly led to the completion of the primary objective of the active subgoal (opening the file). The content of the file is now available for extraction and storage in the Agent Memory.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Makes the agent wait for 10 seconds. Use this if a page is not loaded.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: The agent will wait for 10 seconds. This action is chosen because the current task is to process information already in memory (extracting reimbursable transactions). No direct UI interaction is needed for this specific extraction step. During this \\'wait\\' period, the agent\\'s internal state will be updated by storing the identified reimbursable transaction(s) in the `ExtractedReimbursableTransactions` memory entry. The screen will remain unchanged, showing the content of \\'my_expenses.txt\\'. Actual Outcome: The \\'WAIT\\' action completed successfully. It did not change the screen, which remained on the \\'my_expenses.txt\\' file content. During this wait period, the agent (myself) analyzed the content of \\'MyExpensesFileContent\\'. One reimbursable transaction was identified: \"Car Insurance|$303.01|Transportation\". This information will be stored in the \\'ExtractedReimbursableTransactions\\' memory entry. The action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully extracting the necessary information.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button to navigate from the currently open \\'my_expenses.txt\\' file back to the Markor file browser. This will allow me to search for a \\'pro expense\\' file or folder within Markor. The screen currently shows the content of \\'my_expenses.txt\\'. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully navigated from the content view of \\'my_expenses.txt\\' back to the Markor file browser. The screen now displays the file list within Markor. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal (ID 4) by enabling the search for \\'pro expense\\' within the Markor application.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 5: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,854],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at approximately [85, 854] in the top bar of the Markor app. The search icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to open a search interface within Markor, allowing me to search for \\'pro expense\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor Application\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor application is open and its main screen/file browser is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The app drawer was opened by swiping up on the home screen.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[866,620],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon at [866, 620] to open the application. The Markor app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. This action is predicted to launch the Markor application. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Markor\\' app icon was successful. The Markor application launched, and its file browser interface is now visible, showing the \\'my_expenses.txt\\' file. This completes the first subgoal and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[201,324],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'my_expenses.txt\\' file entry at approximately [201, 324] to open it. The file \\'my_expenses.txt\\' is currently listed in the Markor file browser. This action is predicted to open the file and display its content. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'my_expenses.txt\\' was successful. The file opened, and its content is now displayed on the screen. This directly led to the completion of the primary objective of the active subgoal (opening the file). The content of the file is now available for extraction and storage in the Agent Memory.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Makes the agent wait for 10 seconds. Use this if a page is not loaded.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: The agent will wait for 10 seconds. This action is chosen because the current task is to process information already in memory (extracting reimbursable transactions). No direct UI interaction is needed for this specific extraction step. During this \\'wait\\' period, the agent\\'s internal state will be updated by storing the identified reimbursable transaction(s) in the `ExtractedReimbursableTransactions` memory entry. The screen will remain unchanged, showing the content of \\'my_expenses.txt\\'. Actual Outcome: The \\'WAIT\\' action completed successfully. It did not change the screen, which remained on the \\'my_expenses.txt\\' file content. During this wait period, the agent (myself) analyzed the content of \\'MyExpensesFileContent\\'. One reimbursable transaction was identified: \"Car Insurance|$303.01|Transportation\". This information will be stored in the \\'ExtractedReimbursableTransactions\\' memory entry. The action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully extracting the necessary information.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button to navigate from the currently open \\'my_expenses.txt\\' file back to the Markor file browser. This will allow me to search for a \\'pro expense\\' file or folder within Markor. The screen currently shows the content of \\'my_expenses.txt\\'. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully navigated from the content view of \\'my_expenses.txt\\' back to the Markor file browser. The screen now displays the file list within Markor. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal (ID 4) by enabling the search for \\'pro expense\\' within the Markor application.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,854],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at approximately [85, 854] in the top bar of the Markor app. The search icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to open a search interface within Markor, allowing me to search for \\'pro expense\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the search icon was successful. A \"Search\" dialog box appeared on the screen. This dialog box contains a text field for entering the search query, along with options for regex search, case sensitivity, and searching in content. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of locating \\'pro expense\\' by allowing the agent to search for it.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.39\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [74, 38, 96, 203], \\'text\\': \\'Markor\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [143, 140, 166, 688], \\'text\\': \\'Istorage/emulated/0/Documents\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 143, 223, 504], \\'text\\': \\'my_expenses.txt 5/13/2025, 18.26\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [349, 95, 371, 255], \\'text\\': \\'Search\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [379, 82, 401, 649], \\'text\\': \\'Recursive search in current directory.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [422, 91, 442, 233], \\'text\\': \\'Search\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [474, 157, 495, 374], \\'text\\': \\'Regex search\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [519, 161, 534, 387], \\'text\\': \\'Case sensitive\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [561, 158, 578, 432], \\'text\\': \\'Search in content\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [661, 614, 677, 752], \\'text\\': \\'CANCEL\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [662, 831, 677, 882], \\'text\\': \\'OK\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [949, 85, 966, 163], \\'text\\': \\'Files\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 333, 966, 417], \\'text\\': \\'To-Do\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 553, 966, 699], \\'text\\': \\'QuickNote\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [951, 838, 967, 914], \\'text\\': \\'More\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [833, 819, 895, 968]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 1, 974, 255]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 493, 974, 755]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 251, 974, 498]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 823, 35, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 616, 114, 706]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 905, 35, 942]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 837, 972, 913]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 904, 98, 984]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 196, 36, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 142, 36, 188]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 806, 112, 905]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [324, 85, 455, 911]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 708, 102, 801]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [985, 363, 1000, 634]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [549, 83, 592, 162]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"Search\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nGo through the transactions in my_expenses.txt in Markor. Log the reimbursable transactions in the pro expense.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[866,620],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon at [866, 620] to open the application. The Markor app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. This action is predicted to launch the Markor application. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Markor\\' app icon was successful. The Markor application launched, and its file browser interface is now visible, showing the \\'my_expenses.txt\\' file. This completes the first subgoal and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[201,324],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'my_expenses.txt\\' file entry at approximately [201, 324] to open it. The file \\'my_expenses.txt\\' is currently listed in the Markor file browser. This action is predicted to open the file and display its content. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'my_expenses.txt\\' was successful. The file opened, and its content is now displayed on the screen. This directly led to the completion of the primary objective of the active subgoal (opening the file). The content of the file is now available for extraction and storage in the Agent Memory.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Makes the agent wait for 10 seconds. Use this if a page is not loaded.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: The agent will wait for 10 seconds. This action is chosen because the current task is to process information already in memory (extracting reimbursable transactions). No direct UI interaction is needed for this specific extraction step. During this \\'wait\\' period, the agent\\'s internal state will be updated by storing the identified reimbursable transaction(s) in the `ExtractedReimbursableTransactions` memory entry. The screen will remain unchanged, showing the content of \\'my_expenses.txt\\'. Actual Outcome: The \\'WAIT\\' action completed successfully. It did not change the screen, which remained on the \\'my_expenses.txt\\' file content. During this wait period, the agent (myself) analyzed the content of \\'MyExpensesFileContent\\'. One reimbursable transaction was identified: \"Car Insurance|$303.01|Transportation\". This information will be stored in the \\'ExtractedReimbursableTransactions\\' memory entry. The action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully extracting the necessary information.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button to navigate from the currently open \\'my_expenses.txt\\' file back to the Markor file browser. This will allow me to search for a \\'pro expense\\' file or folder within Markor. The screen currently shows the content of \\'my_expenses.txt\\'. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully navigated from the content view of \\'my_expenses.txt\\' back to the Markor file browser. The screen now displays the file list within Markor. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal (ID 4) by enabling the search for \\'pro expense\\' within the Markor application.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,854],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at approximately [85, 854] in the top bar of the Markor app. The search icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to open a search interface within Markor, allowing me to search for \\'pro expense\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the search icon was successful. A \"Search\" dialog box appeared on the screen. This dialog box contains a text field for entering the search query, along with options for regex search, case sensitivity, and searching in content. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of locating \\'pro expense\\' by allowing the agent to search for it.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 6: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[432,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search text field within the \\'Search\\' dialog. The text field is currently empty. This action is predicted to focus the text field, allowing text input for the search query. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor Application\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor application is open and its main screen/file browser is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The app drawer was opened by swiping up on the home screen.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[201,324],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'my_expenses.txt\\' file entry at approximately [201, 324] to open it. The file \\'my_expenses.txt\\' is currently listed in the Markor file browser. This action is predicted to open the file and display its content. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'my_expenses.txt\\' was successful. The file opened, and its content is now displayed on the screen. This directly led to the completion of the primary objective of the active subgoal (opening the file). The content of the file is now available for extraction and storage in the Agent Memory.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Makes the agent wait for 10 seconds. Use this if a page is not loaded.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: The agent will wait for 10 seconds. This action is chosen because the current task is to process information already in memory (extracting reimbursable transactions). No direct UI interaction is needed for this specific extraction step. During this \\'wait\\' period, the agent\\'s internal state will be updated by storing the identified reimbursable transaction(s) in the `ExtractedReimbursableTransactions` memory entry. The screen will remain unchanged, showing the content of \\'my_expenses.txt\\'. Actual Outcome: The \\'WAIT\\' action completed successfully. It did not change the screen, which remained on the \\'my_expenses.txt\\' file content. During this wait period, the agent (myself) analyzed the content of \\'MyExpensesFileContent\\'. One reimbursable transaction was identified: \"Car Insurance|$303.01|Transportation\". This information will be stored in the \\'ExtractedReimbursableTransactions\\' memory entry. The action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully extracting the necessary information.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button to navigate from the currently open \\'my_expenses.txt\\' file back to the Markor file browser. This will allow me to search for a \\'pro expense\\' file or folder within Markor. The screen currently shows the content of \\'my_expenses.txt\\'. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully navigated from the content view of \\'my_expenses.txt\\' back to the Markor file browser. The screen now displays the file list within Markor. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal (ID 4) by enabling the search for \\'pro expense\\' within the Markor application.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,854],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at approximately [85, 854] in the top bar of the Markor app. The search icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to open a search interface within Markor, allowing me to search for \\'pro expense\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the search icon was successful. A \"Search\" dialog box appeared on the screen. This dialog box contains a text field for entering the search query, along with options for regex search, case sensitivity, and searching in content. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of locating \\'pro expense\\' by allowing the agent to search for it.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[432,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search text field within the \\'Search\\' dialog. The text field is currently empty. This action is predicted to focus the text field, allowing text input for the search query. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the search text field at [432, 500] was successful. The \\'Search\\' text field within the \\'Search\\' dialog is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, allowing for text input. The text in the search field changed from \\'Search\\' to \\'\u00dfearch\\', which is likely a placeholder or the beginning of an input. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing for the input of the search query.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing.

The text you can edit is: \"Search\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Log the reimbursable transactions in the pro expense.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[201,324],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'my_expenses.txt\\' file entry at approximately [201, 324] to open it. The file \\'my_expenses.txt\\' is currently listed in the Markor file browser. This action is predicted to open the file and display its content. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'my_expenses.txt\\' was successful. The file opened, and its content is now displayed on the screen. This directly led to the completion of the primary objective of the active subgoal (opening the file). The content of the file is now available for extraction and storage in the Agent Memory.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Makes the agent wait for 10 seconds. Use this if a page is not loaded.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: The agent will wait for 10 seconds. This action is chosen because the current task is to process information already in memory (extracting reimbursable transactions). No direct UI interaction is needed for this specific extraction step. During this \\'wait\\' period, the agent\\'s internal state will be updated by storing the identified reimbursable transaction(s) in the `ExtractedReimbursableTransactions` memory entry. The screen will remain unchanged, showing the content of \\'my_expenses.txt\\'. Actual Outcome: The \\'WAIT\\' action completed successfully. It did not change the screen, which remained on the \\'my_expenses.txt\\' file content. During this wait period, the agent (myself) analyzed the content of \\'MyExpensesFileContent\\'. One reimbursable transaction was identified: \"Car Insurance|$303.01|Transportation\". This information will be stored in the \\'ExtractedReimbursableTransactions\\' memory entry. The action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully extracting the necessary information.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button to navigate from the currently open \\'my_expenses.txt\\' file back to the Markor file browser. This will allow me to search for a \\'pro expense\\' file or folder within Markor. The screen currently shows the content of \\'my_expenses.txt\\'. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully navigated from the content view of \\'my_expenses.txt\\' back to the Markor file browser. The screen now displays the file list within Markor. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal (ID 4) by enabling the search for \\'pro expense\\' within the Markor application.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,854],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at approximately [85, 854] in the top bar of the Markor app. The search icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to open a search interface within Markor, allowing me to search for \\'pro expense\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the search icon was successful. A \"Search\" dialog box appeared on the screen. This dialog box contains a text field for entering the search query, along with options for regex search, case sensitivity, and searching in content. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of locating \\'pro expense\\' by allowing the agent to search for it.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[432,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search text field within the \\'Search\\' dialog. The text field is currently empty. This action is predicted to focus the text field, allowing text input for the search query. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the search text field at [432, 500] was successful. The \\'Search\\' text field within the \\'Search\\' dialog is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, allowing for text input. The text in the search field changed from \\'Search\\' to \\'\u00dfearch\\', which is likely a placeholder or the beginning of an input. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing for the input of the search query.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 7: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the current text \\'\u00dfearch\\' from the focused search text field. The search text field is currently focused and contains \\'\u00dfearch\\'. This action will clear the text field, preparing it for new input. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor Application\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor application is open and its main screen/file browser is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The app drawer was opened by swiping up on the home screen.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Use this if a page is not loaded.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: The agent will wait for 10 seconds. This action is chosen because the current task is to process information already in memory (extracting reimbursable transactions). No direct UI interaction is needed for this specific extraction step. During this \\'wait\\' period, the agent\\'s internal state will be updated by storing the identified reimbursable transaction(s) in the `ExtractedReimbursableTransactions` memory entry. The screen will remain unchanged, showing the content of \\'my_expenses.txt\\'. Actual Outcome: The \\'WAIT\\' action completed successfully. It did not change the screen, which remained on the \\'my_expenses.txt\\' file content. During this wait period, the agent (myself) analyzed the content of \\'MyExpensesFileContent\\'. One reimbursable transaction was identified: \"Car Insurance|$303.01|Transportation\". This information will be stored in the \\'ExtractedReimbursableTransactions\\' memory entry. The action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully extracting the necessary information.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button to navigate from the currently open \\'my_expenses.txt\\' file back to the Markor file browser. This will allow me to search for a \\'pro expense\\' file or folder within Markor. The screen currently shows the content of \\'my_expenses.txt\\'. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully navigated from the content view of \\'my_expenses.txt\\' back to the Markor file browser. The screen now displays the file list within Markor. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal (ID 4) by enabling the search for \\'pro expense\\' within the Markor application.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,854],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at approximately [85, 854] in the top bar of the Markor app. The search icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to open a search interface within Markor, allowing me to search for \\'pro expense\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the search icon was successful. A \"Search\" dialog box appeared on the screen. This dialog box contains a text field for entering the search query, along with options for regex search, case sensitivity, and searching in content. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of locating \\'pro expense\\' by allowing the agent to search for it.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[432,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search text field within the \\'Search\\' dialog. The text field is currently empty. This action is predicted to focus the text field, allowing text input for the search query. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the search text field at [432, 500] was successful. The \\'Search\\' text field within the \\'Search\\' dialog is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, allowing for text input. The text in the search field changed from \\'Search\\' to \\'\u00dfearch\\', which is likely a placeholder or the beginning of an input. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing for the input of the search query.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the current text \\'\u00dfearch\\' from the focused search text field. The search text field is currently focused and contains \\'\u00dfearch\\'. This action will clear the text field, preparing it for new input. Actual Outcome: The \\'DELETE_TEXT\\' action partially cleared the search field, changing the text from \\'\u00dfearch\\' to \\'Search\\'. This is considered successful as the field is now ready for the intended input, and placeholder text typically disappears upon typing. The search dialog remains open, and the text field is focused. The action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the search field for the query.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle.

This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Use this if a page is not loaded.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: The agent will wait for 10 seconds. This action is chosen because the current task is to process information already in memory (extracting reimbursable transactions). No direct UI interaction is needed for this specific extraction step. During this \\'wait\\' period, the agent\\'s internal state will be updated by storing the identified reimbursable transaction(s) in the `ExtractedReimbursableTransactions` memory entry. The screen will remain unchanged, showing the content of \\'my_expenses.txt\\'. Actual Outcome: The \\'WAIT\\' action completed successfully. It did not change the screen, which remained on the \\'my_expenses.txt\\' file content. During this wait period, the agent (myself) analyzed the content of \\'MyExpensesFileContent\\'. One reimbursable transaction was identified: \"Car Insurance|$303.01|Transportation\". This information will be stored in the \\'ExtractedReimbursableTransactions\\' memory entry. The action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully extracting the necessary information.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button to navigate from the currently open \\'my_expenses.txt\\' file back to the Markor file browser. This will allow me to search for a \\'pro expense\\' file or folder within Markor. The screen currently shows the content of \\'my_expenses.txt\\'. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully navigated from the content view of \\'my_expenses.txt\\' back to the Markor file browser. The screen now displays the file list within Markor. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal (ID 4) by enabling the search for \\'pro expense\\' within the Markor application.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,854],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at approximately [85, 854] in the top bar of the Markor app. The search icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to open a search interface within Markor, allowing me to search for \\'pro expense\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the search icon was successful. A \"Search\" dialog box appeared on the screen. This dialog box contains a text field for entering the search query, along with options for regex search, case sensitivity, and searching in content. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of locating \\'pro expense\\' by allowing the agent to search for it.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[432,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search text field within the \\'Search\\' dialog. The text field is currently empty. This action is predicted to focus the text field, allowing text input for the search query. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the search text field at [432, 500] was successful. The \\'Search\\' text field within the \\'Search\\' dialog is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, allowing for text input. The text in the search field changed from \\'Search\\' to \\'\u00dfearch\\', which is likely a placeholder or the beginning of an input. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing for the input of the search query.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the current text \\'\u00dfearch\\' from the focused search text field. The search text field is currently focused and contains \\'\u00dfearch\\'. This action will clear the text field, preparing it for new input. Actual Outcome: The \\'DELETE_TEXT\\' action partially cleared the search field, changing the text from \\'\u00dfearch\\' to \\'Search\\'. This is considered successful as the field is now ready for the intended input, and placeholder text typically disappears upon typing. The search dialog remains open, and the text field is focused. The action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the search field for the query.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 8: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"pro expense\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'pro expense\\' into the focused search field. The search field currently contains the placeholder text \\'Search\\'. This action will replace the placeholder with \\'pro expense\\', preparing for the search. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor Application\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor application is open and its main screen/file browser is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The app drawer was opened by swiping up on the home screen.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This will allow me to search for a \\'pro expense\\' file or folder within Markor. The screen currently shows the content of \\'my_expenses.txt\\'. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully navigated from the content view of \\'my_expenses.txt\\' back to the Markor file browser. The screen now displays the file list within Markor. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal (ID 4) by enabling the search for \\'pro expense\\' within the Markor application.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,854],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at approximately [85, 854] in the top bar of the Markor app. The search icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to open a search interface within Markor, allowing me to search for \\'pro expense\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the search icon was successful. A \"Search\" dialog box appeared on the screen. This dialog box contains a text field for entering the search query, along with options for regex search, case sensitivity, and searching in content. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of locating \\'pro expense\\' by allowing the agent to search for it.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

The text field is currently empty. This action is predicted to focus the text field, allowing text input for the search query. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the search text field at [432, 500] was successful. The \\'Search\\' text field within the \\'Search\\' dialog is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, allowing for text input. The text in the search field changed from \\'Search\\' to \\'\u00dfearch\\', which is likely a placeholder or the beginning of an input. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing for the input of the search query.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the current text \\'\u00dfearch\\' from the focused search text field. The search text field is currently focused and contains \\'\u00dfearch\\'. This action will clear the text field, preparing it for new input. Actual Outcome: The \\'DELETE_TEXT\\' action partially cleared the search field, changing the text from \\'\u00dfearch\\' to \\'Search\\'. This is considered successful as the field is now ready for the intended input, and placeholder text typically disappears upon typing. The search dialog remains open, and the text field is focused.

Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \"pro expense\" into the search field was successful. The text \"pro expense\" is now present in the search field, replacing the previous placeholder text. The search dialog remains open, and the text field is still focused.

The text you can edit is: \"pro expense\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nGo through the transactions in my_expenses.txt in Markor. Log the reimbursable transactions in the pro expense.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button to navigate from the currently open \\'my_expenses.txt\\' file back to the Markor file browser. This will allow me to search for a \\'pro expense\\' file or folder within Markor. The screen currently shows the content of \\'my_expenses.txt\\'. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully navigated from the content view of \\'my_expenses.txt\\' back to the Markor file browser. The screen now displays the file list within Markor. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal (ID 4) by enabling the search for \\'pro expense\\' within the Markor application.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,854],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at approximately [85, 854] in the top bar of the Markor app. The search icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to open a search interface within Markor, allowing me to search for \\'pro expense\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the search icon was successful. A \"Search\" dialog box appeared on the screen. This dialog box contains a text field for entering the search query, along with options for regex search, case sensitivity, and searching in content. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of locating \\'pro expense\\' by allowing the agent to search for it.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[432,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search text field within the \\'Search\\' dialog. The text field is currently empty. This action is predicted to focus the text field, allowing text input for the search query. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the search text field at [432, 500] was successful. The \\'Search\\' text field within the \\'Search\\' dialog is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, allowing for text input. The text in the search field changed from \\'Search\\' to \\'\u00dfearch\\', which is likely a placeholder or the beginning of an input. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing for the input of the search query.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the current text \\'\u00dfearch\\' from the focused search text field. The search text field is currently focused and contains \\'\u00dfearch\\'. This action will clear the text field, preparing it for new input. Actual Outcome: The \\'DELETE_TEXT\\' action partially cleared the search field, changing the text from \\'\u00dfearch\\' to \\'Search\\'. This is considered successful as the field is now ready for the intended input, and placeholder text typically disappears upon typing. The search dialog remains open, and the text field is focused. The action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the search field for the query.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"pro expense\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'pro expense\\' into the focused search field. The search field currently contains the placeholder text \\'Search\\'. This action will replace the placeholder with \\'pro expense\\', preparing for the search. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \"pro expense\" into the search field was successful. The text \"pro expense\" is now present in the search field, replacing the previous placeholder text. The search dialog remains open, and the text field is still focused. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of locating \\'pro expense\\' by preparing the search query for execution.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 9: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[644,855],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button to initiate the search for \\'pro expense\\' within the Markor app. The \\'OK\\' button is currently visible in the search dialog. This action is predicted to close the search dialog and display the search results. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor Application\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor application is open and its main screen/file browser is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The app drawer was opened by swiping up on the home screen.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,854],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at approximately [85, 854] in the top bar of the Markor app. The search icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to open a search interface within Markor, allowing me to search for \\'pro expense\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the search icon was successful. A \"Search\" dialog box appeared on the screen. This dialog box contains a text field for entering the search query, along with options for regex search, case sensitivity, and searching in content. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of locating \\'pro expense\\' by allowing the agent to search for it.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[432,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search text field within the \\'Search\\' dialog. The text field is currently empty. This action is predicted to focus the text field, allowing text input for the search query. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the search text field at [432, 500] was successful. The \\'Search\\' text field within the \\'Search\\' dialog is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, allowing for text input. The text in the search field changed from \\'Search\\' to \\'\u00dfearch\\', which is likely a placeholder or the beginning of an input. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing for the input of the search query.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the current text \\'\u00dfearch\\' from the focused search text field. The search text field is currently focused and contains \\'\u00dfearch\\'. This action will clear the text field, preparing it for new input. Actual Outcome: The \\'DELETE_TEXT\\' action partially cleared the search field, changing the text from \\'\u00dfearch\\' to \\'Search\\'. This is considered successful as the field is now ready for the intended input, and placeholder text typically disappears upon typing. The search dialog remains open, and the text field is focused. The action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the search field for the query.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"pro expense\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'pro expense\\' into the focused search field. The search field currently contains the placeholder text \\'Search\\'. This action will replace the placeholder with \\'pro expense\\', preparing for the search. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \"pro expense\" into the search field was successful. The text \"pro expense\" is now present in the search field, replacing the previous placeholder text. The search dialog remains open, and the text field is still focused. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of locating \\'pro expense\\' by preparing the search query for execution.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[644,855],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button to initiate the search for \\'pro expense\\' within the Markor app. The \\'OK\\' button is currently visible in the search dialog. This action is predicted to close the search dialog and display the search results. Actual Outcome: Tapping the \\'OK\\' button after entering \\'pro expense\\' in the search field resulted in a \\'Select\\' dialog appearing with the text \\'\u00af\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\\'. This indicates that the search for \\'pro expense\\' within the current directory of Markor yielded no results. The action confirmed that \\'pro expense\\' is not in the expected location within Markor. The agent is not closer to finding \\'pro expense\\' yet, but has narrowed down the search space. The next step is to dismiss the current dialog and explore other search avenues.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 42, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.40\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [74, 38, 96, 203], \\'text\\': \\'Markor\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [143, 140, 166, 688], \\'text\\': \\'Istorage/emulated/0/Documents\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 143, 223, 504], \\'text\\': \\'my_expenses.txt 5/13/2025, 18.26\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [422, 95, 445, 242], \\'text\\': \\'Select\\'}\", \\'{\\\\\\'box_2d\\\\\\': [459, 142, 483, 317], \\\\\\'text\\\\\\': \"L(\\\\\\')JJ-\"}\\', \"{\\'box_2d\\': [588, 772, 603, 908], \\'text\\': \\'CANCEL\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [902, 85, 918, 163], \\'text\\': \\'Files\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [904, 333, 918, 417], \\'text\\': \\'To-Do\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [904, 553, 918, 699], \\'text\\': \\'QuickNote\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [903, 838, 920, 914], \\'text\\': \\'More\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 653], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [786, 819, 848, 968]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [865, 2, 926, 252]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [865, 252, 927, 496]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [865, 491, 926, 752]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 823, 35, 899]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [948, 656, 1000, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 906, 100, 985]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 904, 36, 942]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [866, 837, 926, 914]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 617, 109, 704]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 808, 105, 902]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 196, 36, 239]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 709, 99, 799]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 142, 36, 188]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nGo through the transactions in my_expenses.txt in Markor. Log the reimbursable transactions in the pro expense.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,854],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at approximately [85, 854] in the top bar of the Markor app. The search icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to open a search interface within Markor, allowing me to search for \\'pro expense\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the search icon was successful. A \"Search\" dialog box appeared on the screen. This dialog box contains a text field for entering the search query, along with options for regex search, case sensitivity, and searching in content. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of locating \\'pro expense\\' by allowing the agent to search for it.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[432,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search text field within the \\'Search\\' dialog. The text field is currently empty. This action is predicted to focus the text field, allowing text input for the search query. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the search text field at [432, 500] was successful. The \\'Search\\' text field within the \\'Search\\' dialog is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, allowing for text input. The text in the search field changed from \\'Search\\' to \\'\u00dfearch\\', which is likely a placeholder or the beginning of an input. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing for the input of the search query.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the current text \\'\u00dfearch\\' from the focused search text field. The search text field is currently focused and contains \\'\u00dfearch\\'. This action will clear the text field, preparing it for new input. Actual Outcome: The \\'DELETE_TEXT\\' action partially cleared the search field, changing the text from \\'\u00dfearch\\' to \\'Search\\'. This is considered successful as the field is now ready for the intended input, and placeholder text typically disappears upon typing. The search dialog remains open, and the text field is focused. The action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the search field for the query.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"pro expense\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'pro expense\\' into the focused search field. The search field currently contains the placeholder text \\'Search\\'. This action will replace the placeholder with \\'pro expense\\', preparing for the search. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \"pro expense\" into the search field was successful. The text \"pro expense\" is now present in the search field, replacing the previous placeholder text. The search dialog remains open, and the text field is still focused. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of locating \\'pro expense\\' by preparing the search query for execution.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[644,855],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button to initiate the search for \\'pro expense\\' within the Markor app. The \\'OK\\' button is currently visible in the search dialog. This action is predicted to close the search dialog and display the search results. Actual Outcome: Tapping the \\'OK\\' button after entering \\'pro expense\\' in the search field resulted in a \\'Select\\' dialog appearing with the text \\'\u00af\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\\'. This indicates that the search for \\'pro expense\\' within the current directory of Markor yielded no results. The action confirmed that \\'pro expense\\' is not in the expected location within Markor. The agent is not closer to finding \\'pro expense\\' yet, but has narrowed down the search space. The next step is to dismiss the current dialog and explore other search avenues.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 10: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[595,840],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'CANCEL\\' button to dismiss the \\'Select\\' dialog. The \\'CANCEL\\' button is located at approximately [595, 840]. This action is predicted to close the dialog and return to the Markor file browser. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor Application\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor application is open and its main screen/file browser is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The app drawer was opened by swiping up on the home screen.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[432,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search text field within the \\'Search\\' dialog. The text field is currently empty. This action is predicted to focus the text field, allowing text input for the search query. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the search text field at [432, 500] was successful. The \\'Search\\' text field within the \\'Search\\' dialog is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, allowing for text input. The text in the search field changed from \\'Search\\' to \\'\u00dfearch\\', which is likely a placeholder or the beginning of an input. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing for the input of the search query.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the current text \\'\u00dfearch\\' from the focused search text field. The search text field is currently focused and contains \\'\u00dfearch\\'. This action will clear the text field, preparing it for new input. Actual Outcome: The \\'DELETE_TEXT\\' action partially cleared the search field, changing the text from \\'\u00dfearch\\' to \\'Search\\'. This is considered successful as the field is now ready for the intended input, and placeholder text typically disappears upon typing. The search dialog remains open, and the text field is focused. The action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the search field for the query.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"pro expense\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'pro expense\\' into the focused search field. The search field currently contains the placeholder text \\'Search\\'. This action will replace the placeholder with \\'pro expense\\', preparing for the search. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \"pro expense\" into the search field was successful. The text \"pro expense\" is now present in the search field, replacing the previous placeholder text. The search dialog remains open, and the text field is still focused. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of locating \\'pro expense\\' by preparing the search query for execution.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[644,855],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button to initiate the search for \\'pro expense\\' within the Markor app. The \\'OK\\' button is currently visible in the search dialog. This action is predicted to close the search dialog and display the search results. Actual Outcome: Tapping the \\'OK\\' button after entering \\'pro expense\\' in the search field resulted in a \\'Select\\' dialog appearing with the text \\'\u00af\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\\'. This indicates that the search for \\'pro expense\\' within the current directory of Markor yielded no results. The action confirmed that \\'pro expense\\' is not in the expected location within Markor. The agent is not closer to finding \\'pro expense\\' yet, but has narrowed down the search space. The next step is to dismiss the current dialog and explore other search avenues.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[595,840],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'CANCEL\\' button to dismiss the \\'Select\\' dialog. The \\'CANCEL\\' button is located at approximately [595, 840]. This action is predicted to close the dialog and return to the Markor file browser. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'CANCEL\\' button at [595, 840] was successful. The \\'Select\\' dialog, which indicated that the search for \\'pro expense\\' within Markor yielded no results, has been dismissed. The screen now displays the Markor file browser. This action allows the agent to proceed with the next steps in the plan to locate \\'pro expense\\', which involves searching for a dedicated app outside of Markor.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 44, 35, 132], \\'text\\': \\'15.41\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [74, 38, 96, 203], \\'text\\': \\'Markor\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 728, 95, 888], \\'text\\': \\'= Q\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [143, 140, 166, 688], \\'text\\': \\'Istorage/emulated/0/Documents\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 143, 223, 504], \\'text\\': \\'my_expenses.txt 5/13/2025, 18.26\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [950, 85, 966, 163], \\'text\\': \\'Files\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [951, 332, 966, 417], \\'text\\': \\'To-Do\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 553, 966, 699], \\'text\\': \\'QuickNote\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 840, 966, 913], \\'text\\': \\'More\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [833, 819, 896, 968]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 494, 973, 757]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 0, 974, 257]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 254, 974, 498]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 823, 37, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 140, 36, 189]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 37, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 910, 101, 984]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 713, 99, 794]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 756, 974, 998]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 815, 103, 895]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 905, 37, 942]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [985, 363, 1000, 634]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 617, 105, 703]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Log the reimbursable transactions in the pro expense.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[432,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search text field within the \\'Search\\' dialog. The text field is currently empty. This action is predicted to focus the text field, allowing text input for the search query. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the search text field at [432, 500] was successful. The \\'Search\\' text field within the \\'Search\\' dialog is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, allowing for text input. The text in the search field changed from \\'Search\\' to \\'\u00dfearch\\', which is likely a placeholder or the beginning of an input. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing for the input of the search query.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the current text \\'\u00dfearch\\' from the focused search text field. The search text field is currently focused and contains \\'\u00dfearch\\'. This action will clear the text field, preparing it for new input. Actual Outcome: The \\'DELETE_TEXT\\' action partially cleared the search field, changing the text from \\'\u00dfearch\\' to \\'Search\\'. This is considered successful as the field is now ready for the intended input, and placeholder text typically disappears upon typing. The search dialog remains open, and the text field is focused. The action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the search field for the query.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"pro expense\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'pro expense\\' into the focused search field. The search field currently contains the placeholder text \\'Search\\'. This action will replace the placeholder with \\'pro expense\\', preparing for the search. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \"pro expense\" into the search field was successful. The text \"pro expense\" is now present in the search field, replacing the previous placeholder text. The search dialog remains open, and the text field is still focused. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of locating \\'pro expense\\' by preparing the search query for execution.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[644,855],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button to initiate the search for \\'pro expense\\' within the Markor app. The \\'OK\\' button is currently visible in the search dialog. This action is predicted to close the search dialog and display the search results. Actual Outcome: Tapping the \\'OK\\' button after entering \\'pro expense\\' in the search field resulted in a \\'Select\\' dialog appearing with the text \\'\u00af\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\\'. This indicates that the search for \\'pro expense\\' within the current directory of Markor yielded no results. The action confirmed that \\'pro expense\\' is not in the expected location within Markor. The agent is not closer to finding \\'pro expense\\' yet, but has narrowed down the search space. The next step is to dismiss the current dialog and explore other search avenues.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[595,840],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'CANCEL\\' button to dismiss the \\'Select\\' dialog. The \\'CANCEL\\' button is located at approximately [595, 840]. This action is predicted to close the dialog and return to the Markor file browser. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'CANCEL\\' button at [595, 840] was successful. The \\'Select\\' dialog, which indicated that the search for \\'pro expense\\' within Markor yielded no results, has been dismissed. The screen now displays the Markor file browser. This action allows the agent to proceed with the next steps in the plan to locate \\'pro expense\\', which involves searching for a dedicated app outside of Markor.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 11: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"3\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send the \\'KEYCODE_HOME\\' key event to navigate to the device\\'s home screen. The current screen is the Markor file browser. This action is predicted to close the Markor app and display the home screen. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor Application\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor application is open and its main screen/file browser is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The app drawer was opened by swiping up on the home screen.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the current text \\'\u00dfearch\\' from the focused search text field. The search text field is currently focused and contains \\'\u00dfearch\\'. This action will clear the text field, preparing it for new input. Actual Outcome: The \\'DELETE_TEXT\\' action partially cleared the search field, changing the text from \\'\u00dfearch\\' to \\'Search\\'. This is considered successful as the field is now ready for the intended input, and placeholder text typically disappears upon typing. The search dialog remains open, and the text field is focused. The action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the search field for the query.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"pro expense\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'pro expense\\' into the focused search field. The search field currently contains the placeholder text \\'Search\\'. This action will replace the placeholder with \\'pro expense\\', preparing for the search. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \"pro expense\" into the search field was successful. The text \"pro expense\" is now present in the search field, replacing the previous placeholder text. The search dialog remains open, and the text field is still focused. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of locating \\'pro expense\\' by preparing the search query for execution.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[644,855],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button to initiate the search for \\'pro expense\\' within the Markor app. The \\'OK\\' button is currently visible in the search dialog. This action is predicted to close the search dialog and display the search results. Actual Outcome: Tapping the \\'OK\\' button after entering \\'pro expense\\' in the search field resulted in a \\'Select\\' dialog appearing with the text \\'\u00af\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\\'. This indicates that the search for \\'pro expense\\' within the current directory of Markor yielded no results. The action confirmed that \\'pro expense\\' is not in the expected location within Markor. The agent is not closer to finding \\'pro expense\\' yet, but has narrowed down the search space. The next step is to dismiss the current dialog and explore other search avenues.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[595,840],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'CANCEL\\' button to dismiss the \\'Select\\' dialog. The \\'CANCEL\\' button is located at approximately [595, 840]. This action is predicted to close the dialog and return to the Markor file browser. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'CANCEL\\' button at [595, 840] was successful. The \\'Select\\' dialog, which indicated that the search for \\'pro expense\\' within Markor yielded no results, has been dismissed. The screen now displays the Markor file browser. This action allows the agent to proceed with the next steps in the plan to locate \\'pro expense\\', which involves searching for a dedicated app outside of Markor.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"3\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send the \\'KEYCODE_HOME\\' key event to navigate to the device\\'s home screen. The current screen is the Markor file browser. This action is predicted to close the Markor app and display the home screen. Actual Outcome: The action of sending \\'KEYCODE_HOME\\' was successful. The Markor app was closed, and the device\\'s home screen is now visible. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing it to search for the \\'pro expense\\' app in the app drawer.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 44, 35, 131], \\'text\\': \\'15.41\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [54, 712, 65, 797], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [123, 46, 147, 306], \\'text\\': \\'Sun; Oct 15\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 336, 722, 431], \\'text\\': \\'Gmail\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 561, 722, 676], \\'text\\': \\'Photos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [704, 781, 722, 921], \\'text\\': \\'YouTube\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [775, 295, 872, 709], \\'text\\': \\'0 (9\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 72, 855, 232]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [788, 765, 856, 929]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [628, 537, 728, 694]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 535, 858, 706]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 299, 856, 466]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 765, 729, 927]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 300, 730, 463]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [900, 701, 948, 795]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [892, 800, 952, 925]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 823, 39, 899]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Log the reimbursable transactions in the pro expense.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the current text \\'\u00dfearch\\' from the focused search text field. The search text field is currently focused and contains \\'\u00dfearch\\'. This action will clear the text field, preparing it for new input. Actual Outcome: The \\'DELETE_TEXT\\' action partially cleared the search field, changing the text from \\'\u00dfearch\\' to \\'Search\\'. This is considered successful as the field is now ready for the intended input, and placeholder text typically disappears upon typing. The search dialog remains open, and the text field is focused. The action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the search field for the query.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"pro expense\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'pro expense\\' into the focused search field. The search field currently contains the placeholder text \\'Search\\'. This action will replace the placeholder with \\'pro expense\\', preparing for the search. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \"pro expense\" into the search field was successful. The text \"pro expense\" is now present in the search field, replacing the previous placeholder text. The search dialog remains open, and the text field is still focused. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of locating \\'pro expense\\' by preparing the search query for execution.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[644,855],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button to initiate the search for \\'pro expense\\' within the Markor app. The \\'OK\\' button is currently visible in the search dialog. This action is predicted to close the search dialog and display the search results. Actual Outcome: Tapping the \\'OK\\' button after entering \\'pro expense\\' in the search field resulted in a \\'Select\\' dialog appearing with the text \\'\u00af\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\\'. This indicates that the search for \\'pro expense\\' within the current directory of Markor yielded no results. The action confirmed that \\'pro expense\\' is not in the expected location within Markor. The agent is not closer to finding \\'pro expense\\' yet, but has narrowed down the search space. The next step is to dismiss the current dialog and explore other search avenues.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[595,840],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'CANCEL\\' button to dismiss the \\'Select\\' dialog. The \\'CANCEL\\' button is located at approximately [595, 840]. This action is predicted to close the dialog and return to the Markor file browser. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'CANCEL\\' button at [595, 840] was successful. The \\'Select\\' dialog, which indicated that the search for \\'pro expense\\' within Markor yielded no results, has been dismissed. The screen now displays the Markor file browser. This action allows the agent to proceed with the next steps in the plan to locate \\'pro expense\\', which involves searching for a dedicated app outside of Markor.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"3\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send the \\'KEYCODE_HOME\\' key event to navigate to the device\\'s home screen. The current screen is the Markor file browser. This action is predicted to close the Markor app and display the home screen. Actual Outcome: The action of sending \\'KEYCODE_HOME\\' was successful. The Markor app was closed, and the device\\'s home screen is now visible. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing it to search for the \\'pro expense\\' app in the app drawer.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 12: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[400,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. This action is predicted to reveal the app drawer, allowing a search for the \\'Pro Expense\\' app. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor Application\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor application is open and its main screen/file browser is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The app drawer was opened by swiping up on the home screen.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The search field currently contains the placeholder text \\'Search\\'. This action will replace the placeholder with \\'pro expense\\', preparing for the search. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \"pro expense\" into the search field was successful. The text \"pro expense\" is now present in the search field, replacing the previous placeholder text. The search dialog remains open, and the text field is still focused. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of locating \\'pro expense\\' by preparing the search query for execution.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[644,855],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button to initiate the search for \\'pro expense\\' within the Markor app. The \\'OK\\' button is currently visible in the search dialog. This action is predicted to close the search dialog and display the search results. Actual Outcome: Tapping the \\'OK\\' button after entering \\'pro expense\\' in the search field resulted in a \\'Select\\' dialog appearing with the text \\'\u00af\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\\'. This indicates that the search for \\'pro expense\\' within the current directory of Markor yielded no results. The action confirmed that \\'pro expense\\' is not in the expected location within Markor. The agent is not closer to finding \\'pro expense\\' yet, but has narrowed down the search space. The next step is to dismiss the current dialog and explore other search avenues.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[595,840],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'CANCEL\\' button to dismiss the \\'Select\\' dialog. The \\'CANCEL\\' button is located at approximately [595, 840]. This action is predicted to close the dialog and return to the Markor file browser. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'CANCEL\\' button at [595, 840] was successful. The \\'Select\\' dialog, which indicated that the search for \\'pro expense\\' within Markor yielded no results, has been dismissed. The screen now displays the Markor file browser. This action allows the agent to proceed with the next steps in the plan to locate \\'pro expense\\', which involves searching for a dedicated app outside of Markor.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"3\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send the \\'KEYCODE_HOME\\' key event to navigate to the device\\'s home screen. The current screen is the Markor file browser. This action is predicted to close the Markor app and display the home screen. Actual Outcome: The action of sending \\'KEYCODE_HOME\\' was successful. The Markor app was closed, and the device\\'s home screen is now visible. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing it to search for the \\'pro expense\\' app in the app drawer.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[400,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. This action is predicted to reveal the app drawer, allowing a search for the \\'Pro Expense\\' app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing access to the list of installed apps.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The search field currently contains the placeholder text \\'Search\\'. This action will replace the placeholder with \\'pro expense\\', preparing for the search. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \"pro expense\" into the search field was successful. The text \"pro expense\" is now present in the search field, replacing the previous placeholder text. The search dialog remains open, and the text field is still focused. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of locating \\'pro expense\\' by preparing the search query for execution.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

This action is predicted to close the search dialog and display the search results. Actual Outcome: Tapping the \\'OK\\' button after entering \\'pro expense\\' in the search field resulted in a \\'Select\\' dialog appearing with the text \\'\u00af\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\\'. This indicates that the search for \\'pro expense\\' within the current directory of Markor yielded no results. The action confirmed that \\'pro expense\\' is not in the expected location within Markor. The agent is not closer to finding \\'pro expense\\' yet, but has narrowed down the search space. The next step is to dismiss the current dialog and explore other search avenues.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[595,840],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'CANCEL\\' button to dismiss the \\'Select\\' dialog.

Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'CANCEL\\' button at [595, 840] was successful. The \\'Select\\' dialog, which indicated that the search for \\'pro expense\\' within Markor yielded no results, has been dismissed. The screen now displays the Markor file browser. This action allows the agent to proceed with the next steps in the plan to locate \\'pro expense\\', which involves searching for a dedicated app outside of Markor.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"3\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send the \\'KEYCODE_HOME\\' key event to navigate to the device\\'s home screen.

The Markor app was closed, and the device\\'s home screen is now visible. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing it to search for the \\'pro expense\\' app in the app drawer.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[400,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen to open the app drawer.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[644,855],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button to initiate the search for \\'pro expense\\' within the Markor app. The \\'OK\\' button is currently visible in the search dialog. This action is predicted to close the search dialog and display the search results. Actual Outcome: Tapping the \\'OK\\' button after entering \\'pro expense\\' in the search field resulted in a \\'Select\\' dialog appearing with the text \\'\u00af\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\\'. This indicates that the search for \\'pro expense\\' within the current directory of Markor yielded no results. The action confirmed that \\'pro expense\\' is not in the expected location within Markor. The agent is not closer to finding \\'pro expense\\' yet, but has narrowed down the search space. The next step is to dismiss the current dialog and explore other search avenues.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[595,840],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'CANCEL\\' button to dismiss the \\'Select\\' dialog. The \\'CANCEL\\' button is located at approximately [595, 840]. This action is predicted to close the dialog and return to the Markor file browser. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'CANCEL\\' button at [595, 840] was successful. The \\'Select\\' dialog, which indicated that the search for \\'pro expense\\' within Markor yielded no results, has been dismissed. The screen now displays the Markor file browser. This action allows the agent to proceed with the next steps in the plan to locate \\'pro expense\\', which involves searching for a dedicated app outside of Markor.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"3\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send the \\'KEYCODE_HOME\\' key event to navigate to the device\\'s home screen. The current screen is the Markor file browser. This action is predicted to close the Markor app and display the home screen. Actual Outcome: The action of sending \\'KEYCODE_HOME\\' was successful. The Markor app was closed, and the device\\'s home screen is now visible. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing it to search for the \\'pro expense\\' app in the app drawer.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[400,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. This action is predicted to reveal the app drawer, allowing a search for the \\'Pro Expense\\' app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing access to the list of installed apps.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen to scroll down the app drawer and reveal more applications. The current screen shows the top portion of the app drawer. This action is predicted to display more apps, potentially including \\'Pro Expense\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, revealing more applications. The \\'Pro Expense\\' app is now visible on the screen.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Log the reimbursable transactions in the pro expense.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[644,855],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button to initiate the search for \\'pro expense\\' within the Markor app. The \\'OK\\' button is currently visible in the search dialog. This action is predicted to close the search dialog and display the search results. Actual Outcome: Tapping the \\'OK\\' button after entering \\'pro expense\\' in the search field resulted in a \\'Select\\' dialog appearing with the text \\'\u00af\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\\'. This indicates that the search for \\'pro expense\\' within the current directory of Markor yielded no results. The action confirmed that \\'pro expense\\' is not in the expected location within Markor. The agent is not closer to finding \\'pro expense\\' yet, but has narrowed down the search space. The next step is to dismiss the current dialog and explore other search avenues.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[595,840],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'CANCEL\\' button to dismiss the \\'Select\\' dialog. The \\'CANCEL\\' button is located at approximately [595, 840]. This action is predicted to close the dialog and return to the Markor file browser. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'CANCEL\\' button at [595, 840] was successful. The \\'Select\\' dialog, which indicated that the search for \\'pro expense\\' within Markor yielded no results, has been dismissed. The screen now displays the Markor file browser. This action allows the agent to proceed with the next steps in the plan to locate \\'pro expense\\', which involves searching for a dedicated app outside of Markor.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"3\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send the \\'KEYCODE_HOME\\' key event to navigate to the device\\'s home screen. The current screen is the Markor file browser. This action is predicted to close the Markor app and display the home screen. Actual Outcome: The action of sending \\'KEYCODE_HOME\\' was successful. The Markor app was closed, and the device\\'s home screen is now visible. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing it to search for the \\'pro expense\\' app in the app drawer.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[400,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. This action is predicted to reveal the app drawer, allowing a search for the \\'Pro Expense\\' app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing access to the list of installed apps.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen to scroll down the app drawer and reveal more applications. The current screen shows the top portion of the app drawer. This action is predicted to display more apps, potentially including \\'Pro Expense\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, revealing more applications. The \\'Pro Expense\\' app is now visible on the screen. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the target application has been located.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 14: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[647,394],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon to open the application. The \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. This action is predicted to launch the \\'Pro Expense\\' app, allowing the agent to observe its interface and determine the transaction entry format. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor Application\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor application is open and its main screen/file browser is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The app drawer was opened by swiping up on the home screen.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[595,840],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'CANCEL\\' button to dismiss the \\'Select\\' dialog. The \\'CANCEL\\' button is located at approximately [595, 840]. This action is predicted to close the dialog and return to the Markor file browser. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'CANCEL\\' button at [595, 840] was successful. The \\'Select\\' dialog, which indicated that the search for \\'pro expense\\' within Markor yielded no results, has been dismissed. The screen now displays the Markor file browser. This action allows the agent to proceed with the next steps in the plan to locate \\'pro expense\\', which involves searching for a dedicated app outside of Markor.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"3\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send the \\'KEYCODE_HOME\\' key event to navigate to the device\\'s home screen. The current screen is the Markor file browser. This action is predicted to close the Markor app and display the home screen. Actual Outcome: The action of sending \\'KEYCODE_HOME\\' was successful. The Markor app was closed, and the device\\'s home screen is now visible. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing it to search for the \\'pro expense\\' app in the app drawer.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[400,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. This action is predicted to reveal the app drawer, allowing a search for the \\'Pro Expense\\' app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing access to the list of installed apps.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen to scroll down the app drawer and reveal more applications. The current screen shows the top portion of the app drawer. This action is predicted to display more apps, potentially including \\'Pro Expense\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, revealing more applications. The \\'Pro Expense\\' app is now visible on the screen. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the target application has been located.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[647,394],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon to open the application. The \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. This action is predicted to launch the \\'Pro Expense\\' app, allowing the agent to observe its interface and determine the transaction entry format. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon was successful. The \\'Pro Expense\\' application launched and its home screen is now displayed. This allows the agent to proceed with determining the transaction entry format. The floating action button with a \\'+\\' icon at [898, 893] is likely the way to add new transactions.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Log the reimbursable transactions in the pro expense.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[595,840],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'CANCEL\\' button to dismiss the \\'Select\\' dialog. The \\'CANCEL\\' button is located at approximately [595, 840]. This action is predicted to close the dialog and return to the Markor file browser. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'CANCEL\\' button at [595, 840] was successful. The \\'Select\\' dialog, which indicated that the search for \\'pro expense\\' within Markor yielded no results, has been dismissed. The screen now displays the Markor file browser. This action allows the agent to proceed with the next steps in the plan to locate \\'pro expense\\', which involves searching for a dedicated app outside of Markor.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"3\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send the \\'KEYCODE_HOME\\' key event to navigate to the device\\'s home screen. The current screen is the Markor file browser. This action is predicted to close the Markor app and display the home screen. Actual Outcome: The action of sending \\'KEYCODE_HOME\\' was successful. The Markor app was closed, and the device\\'s home screen is now visible. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing it to search for the \\'pro expense\\' app in the app drawer.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[400,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. This action is predicted to reveal the app drawer, allowing a search for the \\'Pro Expense\\' app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing access to the list of installed apps.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen to scroll down the app drawer and reveal more applications. The current screen shows the top portion of the app drawer. This action is predicted to display more apps, potentially including \\'Pro Expense\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, revealing more applications. The \\'Pro Expense\\' app is now visible on the screen. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the target application has been located.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[647,394],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon to open the application. The \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. This action is predicted to launch the \\'Pro Expense\\' app, allowing the agent to observe its interface and determine the transaction entry format. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon was successful. The \\'Pro Expense\\' application launched and its home screen is now displayed. This allows the agent to proceed with determining the transaction entry format. The floating action button with a \\'+\\' icon at [898, 893] is likely the way to add new transactions.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 15: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[909,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'+\\' floating action button to open the transaction entry screen. The button is located at the bottom right of the screen, with a bounding box of [878, 820, 940, 966]. Tapping this button is predicted to navigate to a new screen where transaction details can be entered. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor Application\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor application is open and its main screen/file browser is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The app drawer was opened by swiping up on the home screen.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16.

The current screen is the Markor file browser. This action is predicted to close the Markor app and display the home screen. Actual Outcome: The action of sending \\'KEYCODE_HOME\\' was successful. The Markor app was closed, and the device\\'s home screen is now visible. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing it to search for the \\'pro expense\\' app in the app drawer.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[400,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. This action is predicted to reveal the app drawer, allowing a search for the \\'Pro Expense\\' app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing access to the list of installed apps.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen to scroll down the app drawer and reveal more applications. The current screen shows the top portion of the app drawer. This action is predicted to display more apps, potentially including \\'Pro Expense\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, revealing more applications. The \\'Pro Expense\\' app is now visible on the screen. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the target application has been located.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[647,394],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon to open the application. The \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. This action is predicted to launch the \\'Pro Expense\\' app, allowing the agent to observe its interface and determine the transaction entry format. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon was successful. The \\'Pro Expense\\' application launched and its home screen is now displayed. This allows the agent to proceed with determining the transaction entry format. The floating action button with a \\'+\\' icon at [898, 893] is likely the way to add new transactions.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[909,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'+\\' floating action button to open the transaction entry screen. The button is located at the bottom right of the screen, with a bounding box of [878, 820, 940, 966]. Tapping this button is predicted to navigate to a new screen where transaction details can be entered. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'+\\' floating action button was successful. The application transitioned from its home screen to the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen. This screen provides the interface for entering transaction details, including fields for \\'Name\\', \\'Amount\\', \\'Note\\', and category selection. This outcome directly contributes to completing the active subgoal by allowing the agent to observe and document the transaction entry format.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 42, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.43\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 107, 519], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0 IdY: 0.0 JXv: 0.0 Expense Entry 15 Oct 2023 3.43 PM\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [144, 88, 156, 164], \\'text\\': \\'Name\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [258, 88, 274, 250], \\'text\\': \\'Amount\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [327, 85, 344, 175], \\'text\\': \\'Food\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [328, 225, 344, 358], \\'text\\': \\'Income\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [323, 405, 349, 712], \\'text\\': \\'Housing Social\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [325, 763, 345, 987], \\'text\\': \\'Entertainmel\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [412, 87, 428, 171], \\'text\\': \\'Note\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [533, 372, 549, 471], \\'text\\': \\'SAVE\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [389, 55, 496, 947]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [518, 49, 567, 793]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [315, 390, 362, 571]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [315, 207, 362, 377]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [315, 584, 362, 731]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [315, 745, 363, 990]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [516, 816, 566, 947]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 820, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 195, 37, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 141, 36, 187]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 899, 101, 985]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 783, 112, 869]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 905, 36, 944]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000.

Log the reimbursable transactions in the pro expense.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"3\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send the \\'KEYCODE_HOME\\' key event to navigate to the device\\'s home screen. The current screen is the Markor file browser. This action is predicted to close the Markor app and display the home screen. Actual Outcome: The action of sending \\'KEYCODE_HOME\\' was successful. The Markor app was closed, and the device\\'s home screen is now visible. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing it to search for the \\'pro expense\\' app in the app drawer.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[400,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. This action is predicted to reveal the app drawer, allowing a search for the \\'Pro Expense\\' app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing access to the list of installed apps.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen to scroll down the app drawer and reveal more applications. The current screen shows the top portion of the app drawer. This action is predicted to display more apps, potentially including \\'Pro Expense\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, revealing more applications. The \\'Pro Expense\\' app is now visible on the screen. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the target application has been located.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[647,394],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon to open the application. The \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. This action is predicted to launch the \\'Pro Expense\\' app, allowing the agent to observe its interface and determine the transaction entry format. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon was successful. The \\'Pro Expense\\' application launched and its home screen is now displayed. This allows the agent to proceed with determining the transaction entry format. The floating action button with a \\'+\\' icon at [898, 893] is likely the way to add new transactions.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[909,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'+\\' floating action button to open the transaction entry screen. The button is located at the bottom right of the screen, with a bounding box of [878, 820, 940, 966]. Tapping this button is predicted to navigate to a new screen where transaction details can be entered. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'+\\' floating action button was successful. The application transitioned from its home screen to the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen. This screen provides the interface for entering transaction details, including fields for \\'Name\\', \\'Amount\\', \\'Note\\', and category selection. This outcome directly contributes to completing the active subgoal by allowing the agent to observe and document the transaction entry format.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 16: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' input field to select it. The \\'Name\\' field is currently empty. This action is predicted to focus the \\'Name\\' field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing text input for the transaction name. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor Application\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor application is open and its main screen/file browser is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The app drawer was opened by swiping up on the home screen.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",
        "response": "{'ScreenshotDifferenceObservation': \"The screenshot before the action shows a red ring indicating a tap on the 'Name' input field. The screenshot after the action is identical to the one before, except for the absence of the red ring. This indicates that the tap action did not result in any visible change on the screen, such as the field being focused or the keyboard appearing.\", 'StepByStepExplanation': \"The last action was a tap on the 'Name' input field at coordinates [185, 500], intending to select it for text input. However, the action did not produce the expected outcome; the field was not selected, and the virtual keyboard did not appear. The screen remained unchanged. This means the first step of entering the transaction details (inputting the name) could not be initiated. The failure might be due to the tap not registering correctly or the application requiring a more precise tap.

The current screen is the home screen. This action is predicted to reveal the app drawer, allowing a search for the \\'Pro Expense\\' app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing access to the list of installed apps.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen to scroll down the app drawer and reveal more applications. The current screen shows the top portion of the app drawer. This action is predicted to display more apps, potentially including \\'Pro Expense\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, revealing more applications. The \\'Pro Expense\\' app is now visible on the screen. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the target application has been located.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[647,394],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon to open the application. The \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. This action is predicted to launch the \\'Pro Expense\\' app, allowing the agent to observe its interface and determine the transaction entry format. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon was successful. The \\'Pro Expense\\' application launched and its home screen is now displayed. This allows the agent to proceed with determining the transaction entry format. The floating action button with a \\'+\\' icon at [898, 893] is likely the way to add new transactions.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[909,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'+\\' floating action button to open the transaction entry screen. The button is located at the bottom right of the screen, with a bounding box of [878, 820, 940, 966]. Tapping this button is predicted to navigate to a new screen where transaction details can be entered. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'+\\' floating action button was successful. The application transitioned from its home screen to the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen. This screen provides the interface for entering transaction details, including fields for \\'Name\\', \\'Amount\\', \\'Note\\', and category selection. This outcome directly contributes to completing the active subgoal by allowing the agent to observe and document the transaction entry format.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' input field to select it. The \\'Name\\' field is currently empty. This action is predicted to focus the \\'Name\\' field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing text input for the transaction name. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Name\\' input field at [185, 500] failed. The field was not selected, and the virtual keyboard did not appear. The screen shows no change. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To proceed, the \\'Name\\' field needs to be successfully selected.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 42, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.44\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 107, 519], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0 IdY: 0.0 JXv: 0.0 Expense Entry 15 Oct 2023 3.43 PM\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [144, 88, 156, 164], \\'text\\': \\'Name\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [258, 88, 274, 250], \\'text\\': \\'Amount\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [327, 85, 344, 175], \\'text\\': \\'Food\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [328, 225, 344, 358], \\'text\\': \\'Income\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [323, 405, 349, 712], \\'text\\': \\'Housing Social\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [325, 763, 345, 987], \\'text\\': \\'Entertainmel\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [412, 87, 428, 171], \\'text\\': \\'Note\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [533, 372, 549, 471], \\'text\\': \\'SAVE\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [389, 55, 496, 947]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [518, 49, 567, 793]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [315, 390, 362, 571]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [315, 207, 362, 377]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [315, 584, 362, 731]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [315, 745, 363, 991]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [516, 816, 566, 947]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 819, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 783, 111, 869]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 897, 102, 985]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 196, 37, 241]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 904, 36, 945]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 142, 36, 188]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Log the reimbursable transactions in the pro expense.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[400,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. This action is predicted to reveal the app drawer, allowing a search for the \\'Pro Expense\\' app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing access to the list of installed apps.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen to scroll down the app drawer and reveal more applications. The current screen shows the top portion of the app drawer. This action is predicted to display more apps, potentially including \\'Pro Expense\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, revealing more applications. The \\'Pro Expense\\' app is now visible on the screen. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the target application has been located.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[647,394],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon to open the application. The \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. This action is predicted to launch the \\'Pro Expense\\' app, allowing the agent to observe its interface and determine the transaction entry format. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon was successful. The \\'Pro Expense\\' application launched and its home screen is now displayed. This allows the agent to proceed with determining the transaction entry format. The floating action button with a \\'+\\' icon at [898, 893] is likely the way to add new transactions.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[909,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'+\\' floating action button to open the transaction entry screen. The button is located at the bottom right of the screen, with a bounding box of [878, 820, 940, 966]. Tapping this button is predicted to navigate to a new screen where transaction details can be entered. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'+\\' floating action button was successful. The application transitioned from its home screen to the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen. This screen provides the interface for entering transaction details, including fields for \\'Name\\', \\'Amount\\', \\'Note\\', and category selection. This outcome directly contributes to completing the active subgoal by allowing the agent to observe and document the transaction entry format.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' input field to select it. The \\'Name\\' field is currently empty. This action is predicted to focus the \\'Name\\' field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing text input for the transaction name. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Name\\' input field at [185, 500] failed. The field was not selected, and the virtual keyboard did not appear. The screen shows no change. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To proceed, the \\'Name\\' field needs to be successfully selected.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 17: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' input field again at coordinates [185, 500]. The \\'Name\\' field is currently empty and not focused. This action is predicted to select the \\'Name\\' field, causing it to become focused and the virtual keyboard to appear, allowing for text input. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor Application\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor application is open and its main screen/file browser is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The app drawer was opened by swiping up on the home screen.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The current screen shows the top portion of the app drawer. This action is predicted to display more apps, potentially including \\'Pro Expense\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, revealing more applications. The \\'Pro Expense\\' app is now visible on the screen. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the target application has been located.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[647,394],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon to open the application. The \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. This action is predicted to launch the \\'Pro Expense\\' app, allowing the agent to observe its interface and determine the transaction entry format. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon was successful. The \\'Pro Expense\\' application launched and its home screen is now displayed. This allows the agent to proceed with determining the transaction entry format. The floating action button with a \\'+\\' icon at [898, 893] is likely the way to add new transactions.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[909,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'+\\' floating action button to open the transaction entry screen. The button is located at the bottom right of the screen, with a bounding box of [878, 820, 940, 966]. Tapping this button is predicted to navigate to a new screen where transaction details can be entered. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'+\\' floating action button was successful. The application transitioned from its home screen to the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen. This screen provides the interface for entering transaction details, including fields for \\'Name\\', \\'Amount\\', \\'Note\\', and category selection. This outcome directly contributes to completing the active subgoal by allowing the agent to observe and document the transaction entry format.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' input field to select it. The \\'Name\\' field is currently empty. This action is predicted to focus the \\'Name\\' field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing text input for the transaction name. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Name\\' input field at [185, 500] failed. The field was not selected, and the virtual keyboard did not appear. The screen shows no change. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To proceed, the \\'Name\\' field needs to be successfully selected.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' input field again at coordinates [185, 500]. The \\'Name\\' field is currently empty and not focused. This action is predicted to select the \\'Name\\' field, causing it to become focused and the virtual keyboard to appear, allowing for text input. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Name\\' input field at [185, 500] was successful. The \\'Name\\' field is now selected and focused, as evidenced by the cursor in the field and the \"ADB Keyboard (ON)\" message at the bottom of the screen. The virtual keyboard is active, allowing for text input. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the \\'Name\\' field for the transaction details.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 42, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.46\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 107, 519], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0 IdY: 0.0 JXv: 0.0 Expense Entry 15 Oct 2023 3.43 PM\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [144, 88, 156, 164], \\'text\\': \\'Name\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [258, 88, 274, 250], \\'text\\': \\'Amount\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [327, 85, 344, 175], \\'text\\': \\'Food\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [328, 225, 344, 358], \\'text\\': \\'Income\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [323, 405, 349, 712], \\'text\\': \\'Housing Social\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [325, 763, 345, 987], \\'text\\': \\'Entertainmel\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [412, 87, 428, 171], \\'text\\': \\'Note\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [533, 372, 549, 471], \\'text\\': \\'SAVE\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [389, 55, 496, 947]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [518, 49, 567, 793]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [315, 390, 362, 571]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [315, 207, 362, 377]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [315, 584, 362, 731]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [315, 745, 363, 990]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [516, 816, 566, 947]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 819, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 897, 101, 985]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 782, 112, 870]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 196, 37, 241]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 904, 36, 945]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 141, 36, 188]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"1\", text=\"Name\", resource-id=\"com.arduia.expense:id/edt_name\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"com.arduia.expense\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[63,352][1017,504]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"Name\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Log the reimbursable transactions in the pro expense.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen to scroll down the app drawer and reveal more applications. The current screen shows the top portion of the app drawer. This action is predicted to display more apps, potentially including \\'Pro Expense\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, revealing more applications. The \\'Pro Expense\\' app is now visible on the screen. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the target application has been located.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[647,394],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon to open the application. The \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. This action is predicted to launch the \\'Pro Expense\\' app, allowing the agent to observe its interface and determine the transaction entry format. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon was successful. The \\'Pro Expense\\' application launched and its home screen is now displayed. This allows the agent to proceed with determining the transaction entry format. The floating action button with a \\'+\\' icon at [898, 893] is likely the way to add new transactions.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[909,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'+\\' floating action button to open the transaction entry screen. The button is located at the bottom right of the screen, with a bounding box of [878, 820, 940, 966]. Tapping this button is predicted to navigate to a new screen where transaction details can be entered. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'+\\' floating action button was successful. The application transitioned from its home screen to the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen. This screen provides the interface for entering transaction details, including fields for \\'Name\\', \\'Amount\\', \\'Note\\', and category selection. This outcome directly contributes to completing the active subgoal by allowing the agent to observe and document the transaction entry format.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' input field to select it. The \\'Name\\' field is currently empty. This action is predicted to focus the \\'Name\\' field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing text input for the transaction name. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Name\\' input field at [185, 500] failed. The field was not selected, and the virtual keyboard did not appear. The screen shows no change. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To proceed, the \\'Name\\' field needs to be successfully selected.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' input field again at coordinates [185, 500]. The \\'Name\\' field is currently empty and not focused. This action is predicted to select the \\'Name\\' field, causing it to become focused and the virtual keyboard to appear, allowing for text input. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Name\\' input field at [185, 500] was successful. The \\'Name\\' field is now selected and focused, as evidenced by the cursor in the field and the \"ADB Keyboard (ON)\" message at the bottom of the screen. The virtual keyboard is active, allowing for text input. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the \\'Name\\' field for the transaction details.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 18: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Car Insurance\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Car Insurance\\' into the currently focused \\'Name\\' text field. The \\'Name\\' field is currently empty and focused. This action is predicted to populate the \\'Name\\' field with \\'Car Insurance\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor Application\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor application is open and its main screen/file browser is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The app drawer was opened by swiping up on the home screen.

Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[647,394],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon to open the application. The \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. This action is predicted to launch the \\'Pro Expense\\' app, allowing the agent to observe its interface and determine the transaction entry format. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon was successful. The \\'Pro Expense\\' application launched and its home screen is now displayed. This allows the agent to proceed with determining the transaction entry format. The floating action button with a \\'+\\' icon at [898, 893] is likely the way to add new transactions.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[909,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'+\\' floating action button to open the transaction entry screen. The button is located at the bottom right of the screen, with a bounding box of [878, 820, 940, 966]. Tapping this button is predicted to navigate to a new screen where transaction details can be entered. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'+\\' floating action button was successful. The application transitioned from its home screen to the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen. This screen provides the interface for entering transaction details, including fields for \\'Name\\', \\'Amount\\', \\'Note\\', and category selection. This outcome directly contributes to completing the active subgoal by allowing the agent to observe and document the transaction entry format.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' input field to select it. The \\'Name\\' field is currently empty. This action is predicted to focus the \\'Name\\' field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing text input for the transaction name. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Name\\' input field at [185, 500] failed. The field was not selected, and the virtual keyboard did not appear. The screen shows no change. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To proceed, the \\'Name\\' field needs to be successfully selected.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' input field again at coordinates [185, 500]. The \\'Name\\' field is currently empty and not focused. This action is predicted to select the \\'Name\\' field, causing it to become focused and the virtual keyboard to appear, allowing for text input. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Name\\' input field at [185, 500] was successful. The \\'Name\\' field is now selected and focused, as evidenced by the cursor in the field and the \"ADB Keyboard (ON)\" message at the bottom of the screen. The virtual keyboard is active, allowing for text input. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the \\'Name\\' field for the transaction details.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Car Insurance\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Car Insurance\\' into the currently focused \\'Name\\' text field. The \\'Name\\' field is currently empty and focused. This action is predicted to populate the \\'Name\\' field with \\'Car Insurance\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Car Insurance\\' into the \\'Name\\' field was successful. The text \\'Car Insurance\\' is now correctly displayed in the \\'Name\\' input field. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of logging the transaction, as the first piece of information for the expense entry has been entered.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 42, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.46\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 107, 519], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0 IdY: 0.0 JXv: 0.0 Expense Entry 15 Oct 2023 3.43 PM\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [144, 88, 156, 164], \\'text\\': \\'Name\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [169, 85, 186, 150], \\'text\\': \\'Car\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [165, 150, 195, 335], \\'text\\': \\'Insurancel\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [259, 88, 277, 250], \\'text\\': \\'Amount\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [328, 85, 346, 175], \\'text\\': \\'Food\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [330, 225, 346, 358], \\'text\\': \\'Income\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [328, 408, 350, 712], \\'text\\': \\'Housing Social\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [327, 763, 347, 987], \\'text\\': \\'Entertainmei\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [413, 87, 430, 171], \\'text\\': \\'Note\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [535, 372, 550, 471], \\'text\\': \\'SAVE\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [391, 55, 498, 946]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [519, 49, 569, 793]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [317, 390, 364, 571]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [317, 208, 364, 377]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [317, 583, 364, 731]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [317, 745, 364, 989]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [518, 815, 569, 947]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 819, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 898, 101, 984]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 782, 111, 869]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 196, 37, 241]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 904, 36, 945]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 141, 36, 188]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"0\", text=\"Car Insurance\", resource-id=\"com.arduia.expense:id/edt_name\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"com.arduia.expense\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[63,352][1017,509]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"Car Insurance\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Log the reimbursable transactions in the pro expense.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[647,394],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon to open the application. The \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. This action is predicted to launch the \\'Pro Expense\\' app, allowing the agent to observe its interface and determine the transaction entry format. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon was successful. The \\'Pro Expense\\' application launched and its home screen is now displayed. This allows the agent to proceed with determining the transaction entry format. The floating action button with a \\'+\\' icon at [898, 893] is likely the way to add new transactions.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[909,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'+\\' floating action button to open the transaction entry screen. The button is located at the bottom right of the screen, with a bounding box of [878, 820, 940, 966]. Tapping this button is predicted to navigate to a new screen where transaction details can be entered. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'+\\' floating action button was successful. The application transitioned from its home screen to the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen. This screen provides the interface for entering transaction details, including fields for \\'Name\\', \\'Amount\\', \\'Note\\', and category selection. This outcome directly contributes to completing the active subgoal by allowing the agent to observe and document the transaction entry format.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' input field to select it. The \\'Name\\' field is currently empty. This action is predicted to focus the \\'Name\\' field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing text input for the transaction name. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Name\\' input field at [185, 500] failed. The field was not selected, and the virtual keyboard did not appear. The screen shows no change. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To proceed, the \\'Name\\' field needs to be successfully selected.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' input field again at coordinates [185, 500]. The \\'Name\\' field is currently empty and not focused. This action is predicted to select the \\'Name\\' field, causing it to become focused and the virtual keyboard to appear, allowing for text input. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Name\\' input field at [185, 500] was successful. The \\'Name\\' field is now selected and focused, as evidenced by the cursor in the field and the \"ADB Keyboard (ON)\" message at the bottom of the screen. The virtual keyboard is active, allowing for text input. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the \\'Name\\' field for the transaction details.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Car Insurance\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Car Insurance\\' into the currently focused \\'Name\\' text field. The \\'Name\\' field is currently empty and focused. This action is predicted to populate the \\'Name\\' field with \\'Car Insurance\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Car Insurance\\' into the \\'Name\\' field was successful. The text \\'Car Insurance\\' is now correctly displayed in the \\'Name\\' input field. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of logging the transaction, as the first piece of information for the expense entry has been entered.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 19: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Amount\\' input field. The \\'Amount\\' field is currently empty and not focused. This action is predicted to select the \\'Amount\\' field, making it the active input field and allowing the amount to be entered. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor Application\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor application is open and its main screen/file browser is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The app drawer was opened by swiping up on the home screen.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[909,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'+\\' floating action button to open the transaction entry screen. The button is located at the bottom right of the screen, with a bounding box of [878, 820, 940, 966]. Tapping this button is predicted to navigate to a new screen where transaction details can be entered. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'+\\' floating action button was successful. The application transitioned from its home screen to the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen. This screen provides the interface for entering transaction details, including fields for \\'Name\\', \\'Amount\\', \\'Note\\', and category selection. This outcome directly contributes to completing the active subgoal by allowing the agent to observe and document the transaction entry format.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' input field to select it. The \\'Name\\' field is currently empty. This action is predicted to focus the \\'Name\\' field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing text input for the transaction name. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Name\\' input field at [185, 500] failed. The field was not selected, and the virtual keyboard did not appear. The screen shows no change. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To proceed, the \\'Name\\' field needs to be successfully selected.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' input field again at coordinates [185, 500]. The \\'Name\\' field is currently empty and not focused. This action is predicted to select the \\'Name\\' field, causing it to become focused and the virtual keyboard to appear, allowing for text input. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Name\\' input field at [185, 500] was successful. The \\'Name\\' field is now selected and focused, as evidenced by the cursor in the field and the \"ADB Keyboard (ON)\" message at the bottom of the screen. The virtual keyboard is active, allowing for text input. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the \\'Name\\' field for the transaction details.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Car Insurance\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Car Insurance\\' into the currently focused \\'Name\\' text field. The \\'Name\\' field is currently empty and focused. This action is predicted to populate the \\'Name\\' field with \\'Car Insurance\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Car Insurance\\' into the \\'Name\\' field was successful. The text \\'Car Insurance\\' is now correctly displayed in the \\'Name\\' input field. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of logging the transaction, as the first piece of information for the expense entry has been entered.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Amount\\' input field. The \\'Amount\\' field is currently empty and not focused. This action is predicted to select the \\'Amount\\' field, making it the active input field and allowing the amount to be entered. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Amount\\' input field was successful. The \\'Amount\\' field is now selected and focused, as indicated by the cursor within the field and the updated XML information for the focused text field. The virtual keyboard is active, allowing for numeric input. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the \\'Amount\\' field for the transaction details.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"Amount\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2.

Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Log the reimbursable transactions in the pro expense.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[909,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'+\\' floating action button to open the transaction entry screen. The button is located at the bottom right of the screen, with a bounding box of [878, 820, 940, 966]. Tapping this button is predicted to navigate to a new screen where transaction details can be entered. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'+\\' floating action button was successful. The application transitioned from its home screen to the \\'Expense Entry\\' screen. This screen provides the interface for entering transaction details, including fields for \\'Name\\', \\'Amount\\', \\'Note\\', and category selection. This outcome directly contributes to completing the active subgoal by allowing the agent to observe and document the transaction entry format.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' input field to select it. The \\'Name\\' field is currently empty. This action is predicted to focus the \\'Name\\' field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing text input for the transaction name. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Name\\' input field at [185, 500] failed. The field was not selected, and the virtual keyboard did not appear. The screen shows no change. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To proceed, the \\'Name\\' field needs to be successfully selected.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' input field again at coordinates [185, 500]. The \\'Name\\' field is currently empty and not focused. This action is predicted to select the \\'Name\\' field, causing it to become focused and the virtual keyboard to appear, allowing for text input. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Name\\' input field at [185, 500] was successful. The \\'Name\\' field is now selected and focused, as evidenced by the cursor in the field and the \"ADB Keyboard (ON)\" message at the bottom of the screen. The virtual keyboard is active, allowing for text input. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the \\'Name\\' field for the transaction details.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Car Insurance\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Car Insurance\\' into the currently focused \\'Name\\' text field. The \\'Name\\' field is currently empty and focused. This action is predicted to populate the \\'Name\\' field with \\'Car Insurance\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Car Insurance\\' into the \\'Name\\' field was successful. The text \\'Car Insurance\\' is now correctly displayed in the \\'Name\\' input field. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of logging the transaction, as the first piece of information for the expense entry has been entered.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Amount\\' input field. The \\'Amount\\' field is currently empty and not focused. This action is predicted to select the \\'Amount\\' field, making it the active input field and allowing the amount to be entered. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Amount\\' input field was successful. The \\'Amount\\' field is now selected and focused, as indicated by the cursor within the field and the updated XML information for the focused text field. The virtual keyboard is active, allowing for numeric input. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the \\'Amount\\' field for the transaction details.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 20: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"303.01\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'303.01\\' into the currently focused \\'Amount\\' text field.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Name\\' input field at [185, 500] failed. The field was not selected, and the virtual keyboard did not appear. The screen shows no change. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To proceed, the \\'Name\\' field needs to be successfully selected.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' input field again at coordinates [185, 500]. The \\'Name\\' field is currently empty and not focused. This action is predicted to select the \\'Name\\' field, causing it to become focused and the virtual keyboard to appear, allowing for text input. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Name\\' input field at [185, 500] was successful. The \\'Name\\' field is now selected and focused, as evidenced by the cursor in the field and the \"ADB Keyboard (ON)\" message at the bottom of the screen. The virtual keyboard is active, allowing for text input. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the \\'Name\\' field for the transaction details.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Car Insurance\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Car Insurance\\' into the currently focused \\'Name\\' text field. The \\'Name\\' field is currently empty and focused. This action is predicted to populate the \\'Name\\' field with \\'Car Insurance\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Car Insurance\\' into the \\'Name\\' field was successful. The text \\'Car Insurance\\' is now correctly displayed in the \\'Name\\' input field. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of logging the transaction, as the first piece of information for the expense entry has been entered.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Amount\\' input field. The \\'Amount\\' field is currently empty and not focused. This action is predicted to select the \\'Amount\\' field, making it the active input field and allowing the amount to be entered. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Amount\\' input field was successful. The \\'Amount\\' field is now selected and focused, as indicated by the cursor within the field and the updated XML information for the focused text field. The virtual keyboard is active, allowing for numeric input. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the \\'Amount\\' field for the transaction details.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"303.01\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'303.01\\' into the currently focused \\'Amount\\' text field. The \\'Amount\\' field is currently empty and focused. This action is predicted to populate the \\'Amount\\' field with \\'303.01\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'303.01\\' into the \\'Amount\\' field was successful. The text \\'303.01\\' is now correctly displayed in the \\'Amount\\' input field.

The text you can edit is: \"303.01\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"303.01\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nGo through the transactions in my_expenses.txt in Markor. Log the reimbursable transactions in the pro expense.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' input field to select it. The \\'Name\\' field is currently empty. This action is predicted to focus the \\'Name\\' field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing text input for the transaction name. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Name\\' input field at [185, 500] failed. The field was not selected, and the virtual keyboard did not appear. The screen shows no change. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To proceed, the \\'Name\\' field needs to be successfully selected.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' input field again at coordinates [185, 500]. The \\'Name\\' field is currently empty and not focused. This action is predicted to select the \\'Name\\' field, causing it to become focused and the virtual keyboard to appear, allowing for text input. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Name\\' input field at [185, 500] was successful. The \\'Name\\' field is now selected and focused, as evidenced by the cursor in the field and the \"ADB Keyboard (ON)\" message at the bottom of the screen. The virtual keyboard is active, allowing for text input. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the \\'Name\\' field for the transaction details.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Car Insurance\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Car Insurance\\' into the currently focused \\'Name\\' text field. The \\'Name\\' field is currently empty and focused. This action is predicted to populate the \\'Name\\' field with \\'Car Insurance\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Car Insurance\\' into the \\'Name\\' field was successful. The text \\'Car Insurance\\' is now correctly displayed in the \\'Name\\' input field. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of logging the transaction, as the first piece of information for the expense entry has been entered.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Amount\\' input field. The \\'Amount\\' field is currently empty and not focused. This action is predicted to select the \\'Amount\\' field, making it the active input field and allowing the amount to be entered. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Amount\\' input field was successful. The \\'Amount\\' field is now selected and focused, as indicated by the cursor within the field and the updated XML information for the focused text field. The virtual keyboard is active, allowing for numeric input. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the \\'Amount\\' field for the transaction details.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"303.01\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'303.01\\' into the currently focused \\'Amount\\' text field. The \\'Amount\\' field is currently empty and focused. This action is predicted to populate the \\'Amount\\' field with \\'303.01\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'303.01\\' into the \\'Amount\\' field was successful. The text \\'303.01\\' is now correctly displayed in the \\'Amount\\' input field. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of logging the transaction, as the second piece of information for the expense entry has been entered.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 21: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[340,850],\"end_point\":[340,250],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left on the category bar. The category bar currently shows \\'Food\\', \\'Income\\', \\'Housing\\', \\'Social\\', and \\'Entertainment\\'. The swipe will start from the approximate center of \\'Entertainment\\' at [340, 850] and end near the \\'Food\\' category at [340, 250]. This action is predicted to scroll the category bar to the left, revealing more category options, hopefully including \\'Transportation\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor Application\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor application is open and its main screen/file browser is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The app drawer was opened by swiping up on the home screen.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' input field again at coordinates [185, 500]. The \\'Name\\' field is currently empty and not focused. This action is predicted to select the \\'Name\\' field, causing it to become focused and the virtual keyboard to appear, allowing for text input. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Name\\' input field at [185, 500] was successful. The \\'Name\\' field is now selected and focused, as evidenced by the cursor in the field and the \"ADB Keyboard (ON)\" message at the bottom of the screen. The virtual keyboard is active, allowing for text input. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the \\'Name\\' field for the transaction details.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Car Insurance\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Car Insurance\\' into the currently focused \\'Name\\' text field. The \\'Name\\' field is currently empty and focused. This action is predicted to populate the \\'Name\\' field with \\'Car Insurance\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Car Insurance\\' into the \\'Name\\' field was successful. The text \\'Car Insurance\\' is now correctly displayed in the \\'Name\\' input field. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of logging the transaction, as the first piece of information for the expense entry has been entered.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Amount\\' input field. The \\'Amount\\' field is currently empty and not focused. This action is predicted to select the \\'Amount\\' field, making it the active input field and allowing the amount to be entered. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Amount\\' input field was successful. The \\'Amount\\' field is now selected and focused, as indicated by the cursor within the field and the updated XML information for the focused text field. The virtual keyboard is active, allowing for numeric input. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the \\'Amount\\' field for the transaction details.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"303.01\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'303.01\\' into the currently focused \\'Amount\\' text field. The \\'Amount\\' field is currently empty and focused. This action is predicted to populate the \\'Amount\\' field with \\'303.01\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'303.01\\' into the \\'Amount\\' field was successful. The text \\'303.01\\' is now correctly displayed in the \\'Amount\\' input field. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of logging the transaction, as the second piece of information for the expense entry has been entered.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[340,850],\"end_point\":[340,250],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left on the category bar. The category bar currently shows \\'Food\\', \\'Income\\', \\'Housing\\', \\'Social\\', and \\'Entertainment\\'. The swipe will start from the approximate center of \\'Entertainment\\' at [340, 850] and end near the \\'Food\\' category at [340, 250]. This action is predicted to scroll the category bar to the left, revealing more category options, hopefully including \\'Transportation\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action on the category bar was successful. The category bar scrolled to the left, revealing new categories. The \\'Transportation\\' category, which was previously not visible, is now visible. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of logging the transaction.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"303.01\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Log the reimbursable transactions in the pro expense.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' input field again at coordinates [185, 500]. The \\'Name\\' field is currently empty and not focused. This action is predicted to select the \\'Name\\' field, causing it to become focused and the virtual keyboard to appear, allowing for text input. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Name\\' input field at [185, 500] was successful. The \\'Name\\' field is now selected and focused, as evidenced by the cursor in the field and the \"ADB Keyboard (ON)\" message at the bottom of the screen. The virtual keyboard is active, allowing for text input. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the \\'Name\\' field for the transaction details.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Car Insurance\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Car Insurance\\' into the currently focused \\'Name\\' text field. The \\'Name\\' field is currently empty and focused. This action is predicted to populate the \\'Name\\' field with \\'Car Insurance\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Car Insurance\\' into the \\'Name\\' field was successful. The text \\'Car Insurance\\' is now correctly displayed in the \\'Name\\' input field. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of logging the transaction, as the first piece of information for the expense entry has been entered.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Amount\\' input field. The \\'Amount\\' field is currently empty and not focused. This action is predicted to select the \\'Amount\\' field, making it the active input field and allowing the amount to be entered. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Amount\\' input field was successful. The \\'Amount\\' field is now selected and focused, as indicated by the cursor within the field and the updated XML information for the focused text field. The virtual keyboard is active, allowing for numeric input. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the \\'Amount\\' field for the transaction details.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"303.01\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'303.01\\' into the currently focused \\'Amount\\' text field. The \\'Amount\\' field is currently empty and focused. This action is predicted to populate the \\'Amount\\' field with \\'303.01\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'303.01\\' into the \\'Amount\\' field was successful. The text \\'303.01\\' is now correctly displayed in the \\'Amount\\' input field. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of logging the transaction, as the second piece of information for the expense entry has been entered.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[340,850],\"end_point\":[340,250],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left on the category bar. The category bar currently shows \\'Food\\', \\'Income\\', \\'Housing\\', \\'Social\\', and \\'Entertainment\\'. The swipe will start from the approximate center of \\'Entertainment\\' at [340, 850] and end near the \\'Food\\' category at [340, 250]. This action is predicted to scroll the category bar to the left, revealing more category options, hopefully including \\'Transportation\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action on the category bar was successful. The category bar scrolled to the left, revealing new categories. The \\'Transportation\\' category, which was previously not visible, is now visible. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of logging the transaction.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 22: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[340,589],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Transportation\\' category button. The \\'Transportation\\' category button is currently visible and not selected. This action is predicted to select the \\'Transportation\\' category for the expense entry.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The \\'Name\\' field is currently empty and focused. This action is predicted to populate the \\'Name\\' field with \\'Car Insurance\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Car Insurance\\' into the \\'Name\\' field was successful. The text \\'Car Insurance\\' is now correctly displayed in the \\'Name\\' input field. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of logging the transaction, as the first piece of information for the expense entry has been entered.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Amount\\' input field. The \\'Amount\\' field is currently empty and not focused. This action is predicted to select the \\'Amount\\' field, making it the active input field and allowing the amount to be entered. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Amount\\' input field was successful. The \\'Amount\\' field is now selected and focused, as indicated by the cursor within the field and the updated XML information for the focused text field. The virtual keyboard is active, allowing for numeric input. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the \\'Amount\\' field for the transaction details.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"303.01\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'303.01\\' into the currently focused \\'Amount\\' text field. The \\'Amount\\' field is currently empty and focused. This action is predicted to populate the \\'Amount\\' field with \\'303.01\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'303.01\\' into the \\'Amount\\' field was successful. The text \\'303.01\\' is now correctly displayed in the \\'Amount\\' input field. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of logging the transaction, as the second piece of information for the expense entry has been entered.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[340,850],\"end_point\":[340,250],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left on the category bar. The category bar currently shows \\'Food\\', \\'Income\\', \\'Housing\\', \\'Social\\', and \\'Entertainment\\'. The swipe will start from the approximate center of \\'Entertainment\\' at [340, 850] and end near the \\'Food\\' category at [340, 250]. This action is predicted to scroll the category bar to the left, revealing more category options, hopefully including \\'Transportation\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action on the category bar was successful. The category bar scrolled to the left, revealing new categories. The \\'Transportation\\' category, which was previously not visible, is now visible. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of logging the transaction.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[340,589],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Transportation\\' category button. The \\'Transportation\\' category button is currently visible and not selected. This action is predicted to select the \\'Transportation\\' category for the expense entry. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Transportation\\' category button at coordinates [340, 589] was successful. The \\'Transportation\\' category is now selected, as indicated by its highlighted appearance in the second screenshot. This action moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of logging the transaction.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"303.01\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The \\'Name\\' field is currently empty and focused. This action is predicted to populate the \\'Name\\' field with \\'Car Insurance\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Car Insurance\\' into the \\'Name\\' field was successful. The text \\'Car Insurance\\' is now correctly displayed in the \\'Name\\' input field. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of logging the transaction, as the first piece of information for the expense entry has been entered.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Amount\\' input field. The \\'Amount\\' field is currently empty and not focused. This action is predicted to select the \\'Amount\\' field, making it the active input field and allowing the amount to be entered. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Amount\\' input field was successful. The \\'Amount\\' field is now selected and focused, as indicated by the cursor within the field and the updated XML information for the focused text field. The virtual keyboard is active, allowing for numeric input. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the \\'Amount\\' field for the transaction details.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"303.01\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'303.01\\' into the currently focused \\'Amount\\' text field. The \\'Amount\\' field is currently empty and focused. This action is predicted to populate the \\'Amount\\' field with \\'303.01\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'303.01\\' into the \\'Amount\\' field was successful. The text \\'303.01\\' is now correctly displayed in the \\'Amount\\' input field. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of logging the transaction, as the second piece of information for the expense entry has been entered.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[340,850],\"end_point\":[340,250],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left on the category bar. The category bar currently shows \\'Food\\', \\'Income\\', \\'Housing\\', \\'Social\\', and \\'Entertainment\\'. The swipe will start from the approximate center of \\'Entertainment\\' at [340, 850] and end near the \\'Food\\' category at [340, 250]. This action is predicted to scroll the category bar to the left, revealing more category options, hopefully including \\'Transportation\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action on the category bar was successful. The category bar scrolled to the left, revealing new categories. The \\'Transportation\\' category, which was previously not visible, is now visible. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of logging the transaction.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[340,589],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Transportation\\' category button. The \\'Transportation\\' category button is currently visible and not selected. This action is predicted to select the \\'Transportation\\' category for the expense entry. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Transportation\\' category button at coordinates [340, 589] was successful. The \\'Transportation\\' category is now selected, as indicated by its highlighted appearance in the second screenshot. This action moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of logging the transaction.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 23: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

The \\'SAVE\\' button is currently visible and enabled. This action is predicted to save the current expense entry and potentially navigate back to the main screen of the \\'Pro Expense\\' app or clear the fields for a new entry.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",
