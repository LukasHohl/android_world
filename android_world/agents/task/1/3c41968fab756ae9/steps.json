Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This will reveal a list of all installed applications, allowing me to find and open the \"Pro Expense\" app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \"Pro Expense\" app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (around [900, 500]) towards the top (around [100, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. This will reveal more applications, hopefully including the \"Pro Expense\" app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer upwards. As a result, more apps are visible, including the target \"Pro Expense\" app. The app icon for \"Pro Expense\" is now visible on the screen. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \"Pro Expense\" app.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 2: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

This will reveal more applications, hopefully including the \"Pro Expense\" app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer upwards. As a result, more apps are visible, including the target \"Pro Expense\" app. The app icon for \"Pro Expense\" is now visible on the screen. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \"Pro Expense\" app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[646,393],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Pro Expense\" app icon, which is currently visible in the app drawer. The icon is located around the coordinates [646, 393]. This action is expected to launch the \"Pro Expense\" application, bringing its main screen into view. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \"Pro Expense\" app icon was successful. The \"Pro Expense\" app launched, and its main screen (titled \"Home\") is now visible. This screen displays financial summaries and recent transactions. This outcome directly fulfills the completion criteria for Subgoal 1 (\"Open Pro Expense App\"), bringing the agent closer to the overall user instruction.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

This will reveal a list of all installed applications, allowing me to find and open the \"Pro Expense\" app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \"Pro Expense\" app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (around [900, 500]) towards the top (around [100, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. This will reveal more applications, hopefully including the \"Pro Expense\" app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer upwards. As a result, more apps are visible, including the target \"Pro Expense\" app. The app icon for \"Pro Expense\" is now visible on the screen. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \"Pro Expense\" app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[646,393],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Pro Expense\" app icon, which is currently visible in the app drawer. The icon is located around the coordinates [646, 393]. This action is expected to launch the \"Pro Expense\" application, bringing its main screen into view. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \"Pro Expense\" app icon was successful. The \"Pro Expense\" app launched, and its main screen (titled \"Home\") is now visible. This screen displays financial summaries and recent transactions. This outcome directly fulfills the completion criteria for Subgoal 1 (\"Open Pro Expense App\"), bringing the agent closer to the overall user instruction.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 3: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

Approximate bounding box: [595, 291, 698, 495]\",\"Status\":\"A complete piece of information.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This will reveal a list of all installed applications, allowing me to find and open the \"Pro Expense\" app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \"Pro Expense\" app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (around [900, 500]) towards the top (around [100, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. This will reveal more applications, hopefully including the \"Pro Expense\" app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer upwards. As a result, more apps are visible, including the target \"Pro Expense\" app. The app icon for \"Pro Expense\" is now visible on the screen. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \"Pro Expense\" app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[646,393],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Pro Expense\" app icon, which is currently visible in the app drawer. The icon is located around the coordinates [646, 393]. This action is expected to launch the \"Pro Expense\" application, bringing its main screen into view. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \"Pro Expense\" app icon was successful. The \"Pro Expense\" app launched, and its main screen (titled \"Home\") is now visible. This screen displays financial summaries and recent transactions. This outcome directly fulfills the completion criteria for Subgoal 1 (\"Open Pro Expense App\"), bringing the agent closer to the overall user instruction.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,60],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the top left of the screen (around [85, 60]). This is expected to open a navigation drawer or menu, which should contain an option to view all expenses. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the hamburger menu icon at [85, 60] was successful. A navigation drawer opened on the left side of the screen, revealing several menu options. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to the expense list, as the \"Expense Logs\" option is now visible.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.36\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 428, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [152, 88, 207, 550], \\'text\\': \\'Pro Expense 0 BETA\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [254, 159, 272, 275], \\'text\\': \\'Home\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [305, 155, 330, 424], \\'text\\': \\'Expense Logs\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [359, 157, 377, 339], \\'text\\': \\'Statistics\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [411, 160, 432, 300], \\'text\\': \\'Backup\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [463, 158, 482, 342], \\'text\\': \\'Feedback\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [517, 161, 534, 275], \\'text\\': \\'About\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [568, 155, 590, 317], \\'text\\': \\'Settings\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [615, 736, 626, 774], \\'text\\': \\'FR\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [614, 860, 626, 898], \\'text\\': \\'SA\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [743, 740, 761, 926], \\'text\\': \\'418.6 USD\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [821, 707, 838, 926], \\'text\\': \\'329.99 USD\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [897, 747, 916, 824], \\'text\\': \\'188\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [661, 684, 802, 985]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [878, 818, 940, 967]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [501, 5, 554, 673]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [395, 7, 449, 681]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [448, 6, 501, 679]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 819, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [602, 828, 640, 930]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 906, 36, 943]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [603, 704, 637, 805]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 197, 37, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [554, 4, 606, 674]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nDelete all but one of any expenses in pro expense that are exact duplicates, ensuring at least one instance of each unique expense remains.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 4 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,540],\"end_point\":[400,540],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (around [900, 540]) towards the top (around [400, 540]) to open the app drawer. This will reveal a list of all installed applications, allowing me to find and open the \"Pro Expense\" app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \"Pro Expense\" app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (around [900, 500]) towards the top (around [100, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. This will reveal more applications, hopefully including the \"Pro Expense\" app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer upwards. As a result, more apps are visible, including the target \"Pro Expense\" app. The app icon for \"Pro Expense\" is now visible on the screen. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \"Pro Expense\" app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[646,393],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Pro Expense\" app icon, which is currently visible in the app drawer. The icon is located around the coordinates [646, 393]. This action is expected to launch the \"Pro Expense\" application, bringing its main screen into view. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \"Pro Expense\" app icon was successful. The \"Pro Expense\" app launched, and its main screen (titled \"Home\") is now visible. This screen displays financial summaries and recent transactions. This outcome directly fulfills the completion criteria for Subgoal 1 (\"Open Pro Expense App\"), bringing the agent closer to the overall user instruction.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,60],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the top left of the screen (around [85, 60]). This is expected to open a navigation drawer or menu, which should contain an option to view all expenses. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the hamburger menu icon at [85, 60] was successful. A navigation drawer opened on the left side of the screen, revealing several menu options. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to the expense list, as the \"Expense Logs\" option is now visible.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 4: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[317,289],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Expense Logs\" option in the navigation drawer. This option is currently visible and located around [317, 289]. This action is expected to close the navigation drawer and display the list of expenses. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Pro Expense App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\\\\"Pro Expense\\\\\" app is open, and its main screen or landing page is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully opened the app drawer, scrolled to find the \\\\\"Pro Expense\\\\\" app, and tapped on its icon.

Approximate bounding box: [595, 291, 698, 495]\",\"Status\":\"A complete piece of information.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This will reveal a list of all installed applications, allowing me to find and open the \"Pro Expense\" app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \"Pro Expense\" app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (around [900, 500]) towards the top (around [100, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. This will reveal more applications, hopefully including the \"Pro Expense\" app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer upwards. As a result, more apps are visible, including the target \"Pro Expense\" app. The app icon for \"Pro Expense\" is now visible on the screen. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \"Pro Expense\" app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[646,393],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Pro Expense\" app icon, which is currently visible in the app drawer. The icon is located around the coordinates [646, 393]. This action is expected to launch the \"Pro Expense\" application, bringing its main screen into view. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \"Pro Expense\" app icon was successful. The \"Pro Expense\" app launched, and its main screen (titled \"Home\") is now visible. This screen displays financial summaries and recent transactions. This outcome directly fulfills the completion criteria for Subgoal 1 (\"Open Pro Expense App\"), bringing the agent closer to the overall user instruction.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,60],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the top left of the screen (around [85, 60]). This is expected to open a navigation drawer or menu, which should contain an option to view all expenses. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the hamburger menu icon at [85, 60] was successful. A navigation drawer opened on the left side of the screen, revealing several menu options. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to the expense list, as the \"Expense Logs\" option is now visible.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[317,289],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Expense Logs\" option in the navigation drawer. This option is currently visible and located around [317, 289]. This action is expected to close the navigation drawer and display the list of expenses. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \"Expense Logs\" was successful. The application transitioned from the view with the open navigation drawer to the \"Expense Logs\" screen. This screen presents a list of expenses, each showing details such as the expense name, date, and amount. This outcome directly completes Subgoal 2 (\"Navigate to Expense List\") because the list of all expenses is now visible. The agent is now ready to proceed with recording these expenses.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This will reveal a list of all installed applications, allowing me to find and open the \"Pro Expense\" app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \"Pro Expense\" app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (around [900, 500]) towards the top (around [100, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. This will reveal more applications, hopefully including the \"Pro Expense\" app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer upwards. As a result, more apps are visible, including the target \"Pro Expense\" app. The app icon for \"Pro Expense\" is now visible on the screen. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \"Pro Expense\" app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[646,393],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Pro Expense\" app icon, which is currently visible in the app drawer. The icon is located around the coordinates [646, 393]. This action is expected to launch the \"Pro Expense\" application, bringing its main screen into view. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \"Pro Expense\" app icon was successful. The \"Pro Expense\" app launched, and its main screen (titled \"Home\") is now visible. This screen displays financial summaries and recent transactions. This outcome directly fulfills the completion criteria for Subgoal 1 (\"Open Pro Expense App\"), bringing the agent closer to the overall user instruction.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,60],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the top left of the screen (around [85, 60]). This is expected to open a navigation drawer or menu, which should contain an option to view all expenses. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the hamburger menu icon at [85, 60] was successful. A navigation drawer opened on the left side of the screen, revealing several menu options. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to the expense list, as the \"Expense Logs\" option is now visible.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[317,289],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Expense Logs\" option in the navigation drawer. This option is currently visible and located around [317, 289]. This action is expected to close the navigation drawer and display the list of expenses. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \"Expense Logs\" was successful. The application transitioned from the view with the open navigation drawer to the \"Expense Logs\" screen. This screen presents a list of expenses, each showing details such as the expense name, date, and amount. This outcome directly completes Subgoal 2 (\"Navigate to Expense List\") because the list of all expenses is now visible. The agent is now ready to proceed with recording these expenses.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 5: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Record the currently visible expenses in memory and then swipe up from the bottom of the screen (around [900, 500]) towards the top (around [100, 500]) to scroll down the expense list. This will reveal if there are more expenses to record. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory will be updated with the following: \\n[\\n  {\"description\": \"Membership Fees\", \"date_time\": \"Today 3:00 PM\", \"amount\": \"418.6 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Workshops\", \"date_time\": \"Today 10:00 AM\", \"amount\": \"329.99 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Dividends\", \"date_time\": \"Today 10:00 AM\", \"amount\": \"188.1 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Educational\", \"date_time\": \"Today 7:00 AM\", \"amount\": \"376.97 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Video Games\", \"date_time\": \"Yesterday 1:00 PM\", \"amount\": \"370.81 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Dining Out\", \"date_time\": \"Yesterday 11:00 AM\", \"amount\": \"223.5 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Dividends\", \"date_time\": \"Yesterday 4:00 AM\", \"amount\": \"150.73 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Snacks\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 13\", \"amount\": \"33.88 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Magazines\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 13\", \"amount\": \"185.23 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Educational Software\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 13\", \"amount\": \"78.19 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Jeans\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 12\", \"amount\": \"500.1 $\"}\\n] The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Pro Expense App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\\\\"Pro Expense\\\\\" app is open, and its main screen or landing page is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully opened the app drawer, scrolled to find the \\\\\"Pro Expense\\\\\" app, and tapped on its icon.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"},{\"VariableName\":\"ProExpenseAppLocation\",\"Content\":\"Visible in the app drawer. Approximate bounding box: [595, 291, 698, 495]\",\"Status\":\"A complete piece of information.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This will reveal more applications, hopefully including the \"Pro Expense\" app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer upwards. As a result, more apps are visible, including the target \"Pro Expense\" app. The app icon for \"Pro Expense\" is now visible on the screen. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \"Pro Expense\" app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[646,393],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Pro Expense\" app icon, which is currently visible in the app drawer. The icon is located around the coordinates [646, 393]. This action is expected to launch the \"Pro Expense\" application, bringing its main screen into view. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \"Pro Expense\" app icon was successful. The \"Pro Expense\" app launched, and its main screen (titled \"Home\") is now visible. This screen displays financial summaries and recent transactions. This outcome directly fulfills the completion criteria for Subgoal 1 (\"Open Pro Expense App\"), bringing the agent closer to the overall user instruction.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,60],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the top left of the screen (around [85, 60]). This is expected to open a navigation drawer or menu, which should contain an option to view all expenses. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the hamburger menu icon at [85, 60] was successful. A navigation drawer opened on the left side of the screen, revealing several menu options. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to the expense list, as the \"Expense Logs\" option is now visible.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[317,289],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Expense Logs\" option in the navigation drawer. This option is currently visible and located around [317, 289]. This action is expected to close the navigation drawer and display the list of expenses. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \"Expense Logs\" was successful. The application transitioned from the view with the open navigation drawer to the \"Expense Logs\" screen. This screen presents a list of expenses, each showing details such as the expense name, date, and amount. This outcome directly completes Subgoal 2 (\"Navigate to Expense List\") because the list of all expenses is now visible. The agent is now ready to proceed with recording these expenses.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Record the currently visible expenses in memory and then swipe up from the bottom of the screen (around [900, 500]) towards the top (around [100, 500]) to scroll down the expense list. This will reveal if there are more expenses to record. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory will be updated with the following: \\n[\\n  {\"description\": \"Membership Fees\", \"date_time\": \"Today 3:00 PM\", \"amount\": \"418.6 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Workshops\", \"date_time\": \"Today 10:00 AM\", \"amount\": \"329.99 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Dividends\", \"date_time\": \"Today 10:00 AM\", \"amount\": \"188.1 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Educational\", \"date_time\": \"Today 7:00 AM\", \"amount\": \"376.97 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Video Games\", \"date_time\": \"Yesterday 1:00 PM\", \"amount\": \"370.81 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Dining Out\", \"date_time\": \"Yesterday 11:00 AM\", \"amount\": \"223.5 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Dividends\", \"date_time\": \"Yesterday 4:00 AM\", \"amount\": \"150.73 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Snacks\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 13\", \"amount\": \"33.88 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Magazines\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 13\", \"amount\": \"185.23 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Educational Software\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 13\", \"amount\": \"78.19 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Jeans\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 12\", \"amount\": \"500.1 $\"}\\n] Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900,500] to [100,500] successfully scrolled the \\'Expense Logs\\' screen upwards, revealing older expense entries. The list of expenses on the screen has changed. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of recording all expenses, as it allows more expenses to be viewed and subsequently recorded.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This will reveal more applications, hopefully including the \"Pro Expense\" app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer upwards. As a result, more apps are visible, including the target \"Pro Expense\" app. The app icon for \"Pro Expense\" is now visible on the screen. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \"Pro Expense\" app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[646,393],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Pro Expense\" app icon, which is currently visible in the app drawer. The icon is located around the coordinates [646, 393]. This action is expected to launch the \"Pro Expense\" application, bringing its main screen into view. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \"Pro Expense\" app icon was successful. The \"Pro Expense\" app launched, and its main screen (titled \"Home\") is now visible. This screen displays financial summaries and recent transactions. This outcome directly fulfills the completion criteria for Subgoal 1 (\"Open Pro Expense App\"), bringing the agent closer to the overall user instruction.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,60],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the top left of the screen (around [85, 60]). This is expected to open a navigation drawer or menu, which should contain an option to view all expenses. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the hamburger menu icon at [85, 60] was successful. A navigation drawer opened on the left side of the screen, revealing several menu options. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to the expense list, as the \"Expense Logs\" option is now visible.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[317,289],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Expense Logs\" option in the navigation drawer. This option is currently visible and located around [317, 289]. This action is expected to close the navigation drawer and display the list of expenses. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \"Expense Logs\" was successful. The application transitioned from the view with the open navigation drawer to the \"Expense Logs\" screen. This screen presents a list of expenses, each showing details such as the expense name, date, and amount. This outcome directly completes Subgoal 2 (\"Navigate to Expense List\") because the list of all expenses is now visible. The agent is now ready to proceed with recording these expenses.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Record the currently visible expenses in memory and then swipe up from the bottom of the screen (around [900, 500]) towards the top (around [100, 500]) to scroll down the expense list. This will reveal if there are more expenses to record. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory will be updated with the following: \\n[\\n  {\"description\": \"Membership Fees\", \"date_time\": \"Today 3:00 PM\", \"amount\": \"418.6 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Workshops\", \"date_time\": \"Today 10:00 AM\", \"amount\": \"329.99 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Dividends\", \"date_time\": \"Today 10:00 AM\", \"amount\": \"188.1 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Educational\", \"date_time\": \"Today 7:00 AM\", \"amount\": \"376.97 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Video Games\", \"date_time\": \"Yesterday 1:00 PM\", \"amount\": \"370.81 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Dining Out\", \"date_time\": \"Yesterday 11:00 AM\", \"amount\": \"223.5 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Dividends\", \"date_time\": \"Yesterday 4:00 AM\", \"amount\": \"150.73 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Snacks\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 13\", \"amount\": \"33.88 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Magazines\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 13\", \"amount\": \"185.23 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Educational Software\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 13\", \"amount\": \"78.19 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Jeans\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 12\", \"amount\": \"500.1 $\"}\\n] Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900,500] to [100,500] successfully scrolled the \\'Expense Logs\\' screen upwards, revealing older expense entries. The list of expenses on the screen has changed. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of recording all expenses, as it allows more expenses to be viewed and subsequently recorded. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory is being updated with the expenses visible *before* this swipe, and the next step will be to process the currently visible expenses and scroll again.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 6: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Record the currently visible expenses in memory and then swipe up from the bottom of the screen (around [900, 500]) towards the top (around [100, 500]) to scroll down the expense list. This will reveal if there are more expenses to record. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory will be updated by appending the following:\\n[\\n  {\"description\": \"Jeans\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 11\", \"amount\": \"501.98 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Non-Profit Support\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 11\", \"amount\": \"372 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Car Insurance\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 10\", \"amount\": \"232.66 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Shirt Purchase\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 10\", \"amount\": \"43.79 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Charity Donations\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 9\", \"amount\": \"369.65 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Restaurant Meal\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 7\", \"amount\": \"32.37 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Concert Tickets\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 7\", \"amount\": \"381.86 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Therapy Sessions\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 7\", \"amount\": \"100.31 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Pest Control\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 7\", \"amount\": \"234.63 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Non-Profit Support\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 6\", \"amount\": \"40.4 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Jeans\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 6\", \"amount\": \"499.38 $\"}\\n] The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Pro Expense App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\\\\"Pro Expense\\\\\" app is open, and its main screen or landing page is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully opened the app drawer, scrolled to find the \\\\\"Pro Expense\\\\\" app, and tapped on its icon.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[646,393],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Pro Expense\" app icon, which is currently visible in the app drawer. The icon is located around the coordinates [646, 393]. This action is expected to launch the \"Pro Expense\" application, bringing its main screen into view. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \"Pro Expense\" app icon was successful. The \"Pro Expense\" app launched, and its main screen (titled \"Home\") is now visible. This screen displays financial summaries and recent transactions. This outcome directly fulfills the completion criteria for Subgoal 1 (\"Open Pro Expense App\"), bringing the agent closer to the overall user instruction.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,60],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the top left of the screen (around [85, 60]). This is expected to open a navigation drawer or menu, which should contain an option to view all expenses. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the hamburger menu icon at [85, 60] was successful. A navigation drawer opened on the left side of the screen, revealing several menu options. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to the expense list, as the \"Expense Logs\" option is now visible.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[317,289],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Expense Logs\" option in the navigation drawer. This option is currently visible and located around [317, 289]. This action is expected to close the navigation drawer and display the list of expenses. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \"Expense Logs\" was successful. The application transitioned from the view with the open navigation drawer to the \"Expense Logs\" screen. This screen presents a list of expenses, each showing details such as the expense name, date, and amount. This outcome directly completes Subgoal 2 (\"Navigate to Expense List\") because the list of all expenses is now visible. The agent is now ready to proceed with recording these expenses.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Record the currently visible expenses in memory and then swipe up from the bottom of the screen (around [900, 500]) towards the top (around [100, 500]) to scroll down the expense list. This will reveal if there are more expenses to record. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory will be updated with the following: \\n[\\n  {\"description\": \"Membership Fees\", \"date_time\": \"Today 3:00 PM\", \"amount\": \"418.6 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Workshops\", \"date_time\": \"Today 10:00 AM\", \"amount\": \"329.99 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Dividends\", \"date_time\": \"Today 10:00 AM\", \"amount\": \"188.1 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Educational\", \"date_time\": \"Today 7:00 AM\", \"amount\": \"376.97 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Video Games\", \"date_time\": \"Yesterday 1:00 PM\", \"amount\": \"370.81 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Dining Out\", \"date_time\": \"Yesterday 11:00 AM\", \"amount\": \"223.5 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Dividends\", \"date_time\": \"Yesterday 4:00 AM\", \"amount\": \"150.73 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Snacks\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 13\", \"amount\": \"33.88 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Magazines\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 13\", \"amount\": \"185.23 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Educational Software\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 13\", \"amount\": \"78.19 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Jeans\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 12\", \"amount\": \"500.1 $\"}\\n] Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900,500] to [100,500] successfully scrolled the \\'Expense Logs\\' screen upwards, revealing older expense entries. The list of expenses on the screen has changed. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of recording all expenses, as it allows more expenses to be viewed and subsequently recorded. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory is being updated with the expenses visible *before* this swipe, and the next step will be to process the currently visible expenses and scroll again.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Record the currently visible expenses in memory and then swipe up from the bottom of the screen (around [900, 500]) towards the top (around [100, 500]) to scroll down the expense list. This will reveal if there are more expenses to record. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory will be updated by appending the following:\\n[\\n  {\"description\": \"Jeans\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 11\", \"amount\": \"501.98 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Non-Profit Support\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 11\", \"amount\": \"372 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Car Insurance\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 10\", \"amount\": \"232.66 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Shirt Purchase\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 10\", \"amount\": \"43.79 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Charity Donations\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 9\", \"amount\": \"369.65 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Restaurant Meal\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 7\", \"amount\": \"32.37 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Concert Tickets\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 7\", \"amount\": \"381.86 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Therapy Sessions\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 7\", \"amount\": \"100.31 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Pest Control\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 7\", \"amount\": \"234.63 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Non-Profit Support\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 6\", \"amount\": \"40.4 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Jeans\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 6\", \"amount\": \"499.38 $\"}\\n] Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900,500] to [100,500] was successful. The \\'Expense Logs\\' screen scrolled upwards, revealing older expense entries. The list of expenses on the screen changed from those dated Oct 11-Oct 6 to those dated Oct 6-Oct 2. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of recording all expenses.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[646,393],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Pro Expense\" app icon, which is currently visible in the app drawer. The icon is located around the coordinates [646, 393]. This action is expected to launch the \"Pro Expense\" application, bringing its main screen into view. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \"Pro Expense\" app icon was successful. The \"Pro Expense\" app launched, and its main screen (titled \"Home\") is now visible. This screen displays financial summaries and recent transactions. This outcome directly fulfills the completion criteria for Subgoal 1 (\"Open Pro Expense App\"), bringing the agent closer to the overall user instruction.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,60],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the top left of the screen (around [85, 60]). This is expected to open a navigation drawer or menu, which should contain an option to view all expenses. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the hamburger menu icon at [85, 60] was successful. A navigation drawer opened on the left side of the screen, revealing several menu options. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to the expense list, as the \"Expense Logs\" option is now visible.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[317,289],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Expense Logs\" option in the navigation drawer. This option is currently visible and located around [317, 289]. This action is expected to close the navigation drawer and display the list of expenses. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \"Expense Logs\" was successful. The application transitioned from the view with the open navigation drawer to the \"Expense Logs\" screen. This screen presents a list of expenses, each showing details such as the expense name, date, and amount. This outcome directly completes Subgoal 2 (\"Navigate to Expense List\") because the list of all expenses is now visible. The agent is now ready to proceed with recording these expenses.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Record the currently visible expenses in memory and then swipe up from the bottom of the screen (around [900, 500]) towards the top (around [100, 500]) to scroll down the expense list. This will reveal if there are more expenses to record. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory will be updated with the following: \\n[\\n  {\"description\": \"Membership Fees\", \"date_time\": \"Today 3:00 PM\", \"amount\": \"418.6 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Workshops\", \"date_time\": \"Today 10:00 AM\", \"amount\": \"329.99 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Dividends\", \"date_time\": \"Today 10:00 AM\", \"amount\": \"188.1 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Educational\", \"date_time\": \"Today 7:00 AM\", \"amount\": \"376.97 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Video Games\", \"date_time\": \"Yesterday 1:00 PM\", \"amount\": \"370.81 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Dining Out\", \"date_time\": \"Yesterday 11:00 AM\", \"amount\": \"223.5 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Dividends\", \"date_time\": \"Yesterday 4:00 AM\", \"amount\": \"150.73 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Snacks\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 13\", \"amount\": \"33.88 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Magazines\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 13\", \"amount\": \"185.23 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Educational Software\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 13\", \"amount\": \"78.19 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Jeans\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 12\", \"amount\": \"500.1 $\"}\\n] Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900,500] to [100,500] successfully scrolled the \\'Expense Logs\\' screen upwards, revealing older expense entries. The list of expenses on the screen has changed. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of recording all expenses, as it allows more expenses to be viewed and subsequently recorded. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory is being updated with the expenses visible *before* this swipe, and the next step will be to process the currently visible expenses and scroll again.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Record the currently visible expenses in memory and then swipe up from the bottom of the screen (around [900, 500]) towards the top (around [100, 500]) to scroll down the expense list. This will reveal if there are more expenses to record. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory will be updated by appending the following:\\n[\\n  {\"description\": \"Jeans\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 11\", \"amount\": \"501.98 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Non-Profit Support\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 11\", \"amount\": \"372 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Car Insurance\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 10\", \"amount\": \"232.66 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Shirt Purchase\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 10\", \"amount\": \"43.79 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Charity Donations\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 9\", \"amount\": \"369.65 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Restaurant Meal\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 7\", \"amount\": \"32.37 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Concert Tickets\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 7\", \"amount\": \"381.86 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Therapy Sessions\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 7\", \"amount\": \"100.31 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Pest Control\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 7\", \"amount\": \"234.63 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Non-Profit Support\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 6\", \"amount\": \"40.4 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Jeans\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 6\", \"amount\": \"499.38 $\"}\\n] Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900,500] to [100,500] was successful. The \\'Expense Logs\\' screen scrolled upwards, revealing older expense entries. The list of expenses on the screen changed from those dated Oct 11-Oct 6 to those dated Oct 6-Oct 2. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of recording all expenses.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,60],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the top left of the screen (around [85, 60]). This is expected to open a navigation drawer or menu, which should contain an option to view all expenses. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the hamburger menu icon at [85, 60] was successful. A navigation drawer opened on the left side of the screen, revealing several menu options. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to the expense list, as the \"Expense Logs\" option is now visible.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[317,289],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Expense Logs\" option in the navigation drawer. This option is currently visible and located around [317, 289]. This action is expected to close the navigation drawer and display the list of expenses. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \"Expense Logs\" was successful. The application transitioned from the view with the open navigation drawer to the \"Expense Logs\" screen. This screen presents a list of expenses, each showing details such as the expense name, date, and amount. This outcome directly completes Subgoal 2 (\"Navigate to Expense List\") because the list of all expenses is now visible. The agent is now ready to proceed with recording these expenses.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Record the currently visible expenses in memory and then swipe up from the bottom of the screen (around [900, 500]) towards the top (around [100, 500]) to scroll down the expense list. This will reveal if there are more expenses to record. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory will be updated with the following: \\n[\\n  {\"description\": \"Membership Fees\", \"date_time\": \"Today 3:00 PM\", \"amount\": \"418.6 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Workshops\", \"date_time\": \"Today 10:00 AM\", \"amount\": \"329.99 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Dividends\", \"date_time\": \"Today 10:00 AM\", \"amount\": \"188.1 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Educational\", \"date_time\": \"Today 7:00 AM\", \"amount\": \"376.97 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Video Games\", \"date_time\": \"Yesterday 1:00 PM\", \"amount\": \"370.81 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Dining Out\", \"date_time\": \"Yesterday 11:00 AM\", \"amount\": \"223.5 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Dividends\", \"date_time\": \"Yesterday 4:00 AM\", \"amount\": \"150.73 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Snacks\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 13\", \"amount\": \"33.88 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Magazines\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 13\", \"amount\": \"185.23 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Educational Software\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 13\", \"amount\": \"78.19 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Jeans\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 12\", \"amount\": \"500.1 $\"}\\n] Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900,500] to [100,500] successfully scrolled the \\'Expense Logs\\' screen upwards, revealing older expense entries. The list of expenses on the screen has changed. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of recording all expenses, as it allows more expenses to be viewed and subsequently recorded. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory is being updated with the expenses visible *before* this swipe, and the next step will be to process the currently visible expenses and scroll again.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Record the currently visible expenses in memory and then swipe up from the bottom of the screen (around [900, 500]) towards the top (around [100, 500]) to scroll down the expense list. This will reveal if there are more expenses to record. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory will be updated by appending the following:\\n[\\n  {\"description\": \"Jeans\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 11\", \"amount\": \"501.98 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Non-Profit Support\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 11\", \"amount\": \"372 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Car Insurance\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 10\", \"amount\": \"232.66 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Shirt Purchase\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 10\", \"amount\": \"43.79 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Charity Donations\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 9\", \"amount\": \"369.65 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Restaurant Meal\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 7\", \"amount\": \"32.37 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Concert Tickets\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 7\", \"amount\": \"381.86 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Therapy Sessions\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 7\", \"amount\": \"100.31 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Pest Control\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 7\", \"amount\": \"234.63 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Non-Profit Support\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 6\", \"amount\": \"40.4 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Jeans\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 6\", \"amount\": \"499.38 $\"}\\n] Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900,500] to [100,500] was successful. The \\'Expense Logs\\' screen scrolled upwards, revealing older expense entries. The list of expenses on the screen changed from those dated Oct 11-Oct 6 to those dated Oct 6-Oct 2. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of recording all expenses. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory will be updated with the expenses that were visible *before* this swipe.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Record the currently visible expenses in memory and then swipe up from the bottom of the screen (around [900, 500]) towards the top (around [100, 500]) to scroll down the expense list. This will reveal if there are more expenses to record.

The \"Expense Logs\" screen scrolled upwards, revealing older expense entries. The list of expenses changed from those dated Oct 6 - Oct 2 (as seen in the first screenshot) to those dated Oct 3 - Oct 1 (as seen in the second screenshot). This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of recording all expenses. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory will now be updated with the 11 expenses that were visible *before* this swipe (from \"Car Maintenance\" on Oct 6 to \"School Supplies\" on Oct 2). The next planned action will be to swipe again to check for more expenses, after which the expenses currently visible (from \"Freelance Payment\" on Oct 3 to \"Jeans\" on Oct 1) will be recorded.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,60],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the top left of the screen (around [85, 60]). This is expected to open a navigation drawer or menu, which should contain an option to view all expenses. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the hamburger menu icon at [85, 60] was successful. A navigation drawer opened on the left side of the screen, revealing several menu options. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to the expense list, as the \"Expense Logs\" option is now visible.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[317,289],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Expense Logs\" option in the navigation drawer. This option is currently visible and located around [317, 289]. This action is expected to close the navigation drawer and display the list of expenses. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \"Expense Logs\" was successful. The application transitioned from the view with the open navigation drawer to the \"Expense Logs\" screen. This screen presents a list of expenses, each showing details such as the expense name, date, and amount. This outcome directly completes Subgoal 2 (\"Navigate to Expense List\") because the list of all expenses is now visible. The agent is now ready to proceed with recording these expenses.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Record the currently visible expenses in memory and then swipe up from the bottom of the screen (around [900, 500]) towards the top (around [100, 500]) to scroll down the expense list. This will reveal if there are more expenses to record. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory will be updated with the following: \\n[\\n  {\"description\": \"Membership Fees\", \"date_time\": \"Today 3:00 PM\", \"amount\": \"418.6 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Workshops\", \"date_time\": \"Today 10:00 AM\", \"amount\": \"329.99 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Dividends\", \"date_time\": \"Today 10:00 AM\", \"amount\": \"188.1 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Educational\", \"date_time\": \"Today 7:00 AM\", \"amount\": \"376.97 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Video Games\", \"date_time\": \"Yesterday 1:00 PM\", \"amount\": \"370.81 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Dining Out\", \"date_time\": \"Yesterday 11:00 AM\", \"amount\": \"223.5 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Dividends\", \"date_time\": \"Yesterday 4:00 AM\", \"amount\": \"150.73 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Snacks\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 13\", \"amount\": \"33.88 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Magazines\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 13\", \"amount\": \"185.23 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Educational Software\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 13\", \"amount\": \"78.19 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Jeans\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 12\", \"amount\": \"500.1 $\"}\\n] Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900,500] to [100,500] successfully scrolled the \\'Expense Logs\\' screen upwards, revealing older expense entries. The list of expenses on the screen has changed. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of recording all expenses, as it allows more expenses to be viewed and subsequently recorded. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory is being updated with the expenses visible *before* this swipe, and the next step will be to process the currently visible expenses and scroll again.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Record the currently visible expenses in memory and then swipe up from the bottom of the screen (around [900, 500]) towards the top (around [100, 500]) to scroll down the expense list. This will reveal if there are more expenses to record. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory will be updated by appending the following:\\n[\\n  {\"description\": \"Jeans\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 11\", \"amount\": \"501.98 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Non-Profit Support\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 11\", \"amount\": \"372 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Car Insurance\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 10\", \"amount\": \"232.66 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Shirt Purchase\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 10\", \"amount\": \"43.79 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Charity Donations\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 9\", \"amount\": \"369.65 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Restaurant Meal\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 7\", \"amount\": \"32.37 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Concert Tickets\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 7\", \"amount\": \"381.86 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Therapy Sessions\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 7\", \"amount\": \"100.31 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Pest Control\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 7\", \"amount\": \"234.63 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Non-Profit Support\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 6\", \"amount\": \"40.4 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Jeans\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 6\", \"amount\": \"499.38 $\"}\\n] Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900,500] to [100,500] was successful. The \\'Expense Logs\\' screen scrolled upwards, revealing older expense entries. The list of expenses on the screen changed from those dated Oct 11-Oct 6 to those dated Oct 6-Oct 2. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of recording all expenses. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory will be updated with the expenses that were visible *before* this swipe.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Record the currently visible expenses in memory and then swipe up from the bottom of the screen (around [900, 500]) towards the top (around [100, 500]) to scroll down the expense list.

The `AllExpenseDetails` memory will be updated by appending the following:\\n[\\n  {\"description\": \"Car Maintenance\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 6\", \"amount\": \"314.82 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"New Jacket\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 5\", \"amount\": \"155.71 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Laundry\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 5\", \"amount\": \"496.13 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Furnishing\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 5\", \"amount\": \"489.24 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Consulting Fees\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 5\", \"amount\": \"452.32 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Wedding Gift\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 4\", \"amount\": \"362.97 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Utilities\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 3\", \"amount\": \"367.51 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Seminars\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 3\", \"amount\": \"155.07 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Food Delivery\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 3\", \"amount\": \"302.85 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Freelance Payment\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 3\", \"amount\": \"250.11 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"School Supplies\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 2\", \"amount\": \"367.54 $\"}\\n] Actual Outcome: The swipe action (Step 7) was successful. The \"Expense Logs\" screen scrolled upwards, revealing older expense entries. The list of expenses changed from those dated Oct 6 - Oct 2 (as seen in the first screenshot) to those dated Oct 3 - Oct 1 (as seen in the second screenshot). This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of recording all expenses. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory will now be updated with the 11 expenses that were visible *before* this swipe (from \"Car Maintenance\" on Oct 6 to \"School Supplies\" on Oct 2). The next planned action will be to swipe again to check for more expenses, after which the expenses currently visible (from \"Freelance Payment\" on Oct 3 to \"Jeans\" on Oct 1) will be recorded.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 8: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform a swipe up from the bottom of the screen (around [900, 500]) towards the top (around [100, 500]) to scroll down the expense list.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[317,289],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Expense Logs\" option in the navigation drawer. This option is currently visible and located around [317, 289]. This action is expected to close the navigation drawer and display the list of expenses. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \"Expense Logs\" was successful. The application transitioned from the view with the open navigation drawer to the \"Expense Logs\" screen. This screen presents a list of expenses, each showing details such as the expense name, date, and amount. This outcome directly completes Subgoal 2 (\"Navigate to Expense List\") because the list of all expenses is now visible. The agent is now ready to proceed with recording these expenses.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Record the currently visible expenses in memory and then swipe up from the bottom of the screen (around [900, 500]) towards the top (around [100, 500]) to scroll down the expense list. This will reveal if there are more expenses to record. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory will be updated with the following: \\n[\\n  {\"description\": \"Membership Fees\", \"date_time\": \"Today 3:00 PM\", \"amount\": \"418.6 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Workshops\", \"date_time\": \"Today 10:00 AM\", \"amount\": \"329.99 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Dividends\", \"date_time\": \"Today 10:00 AM\", \"amount\": \"188.1 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Educational\", \"date_time\": \"Today 7:00 AM\", \"amount\": \"376.97 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Video Games\", \"date_time\": \"Yesterday 1:00 PM\", \"amount\": \"370.81 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Dining Out\", \"date_time\": \"Yesterday 11:00 AM\", \"amount\": \"223.5 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Dividends\", \"date_time\": \"Yesterday 4:00 AM\", \"amount\": \"150.73 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Snacks\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 13\", \"amount\": \"33.88 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Magazines\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 13\", \"amount\": \"185.23 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Educational Software\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 13\", \"amount\": \"78.19 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Jeans\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 12\", \"amount\": \"500.1 $\"}\\n] Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900,500] to [100,500] successfully scrolled the \\'Expense Logs\\' screen upwards, revealing older expense entries. The list of expenses on the screen has changed. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of recording all expenses, as it allows more expenses to be viewed and subsequently recorded. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory is being updated with the expenses visible *before* this swipe, and the next step will be to process the currently visible expenses and scroll again.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Record the currently visible expenses in memory and then swipe up from the bottom of the screen (around [900, 500]) towards the top (around [100, 500]) to scroll down the expense list. This will reveal if there are more expenses to record. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory will be updated by appending the following:\\n[\\n  {\"description\": \"Jeans\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 11\", \"amount\": \"501.98 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Non-Profit Support\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 11\", \"amount\": \"372 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Car Insurance\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 10\", \"amount\": \"232.66 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Shirt Purchase\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 10\", \"amount\": \"43.79 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Charity Donations\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 9\", \"amount\": \"369.65 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Restaurant Meal\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 7\", \"amount\": \"32.37 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Concert Tickets\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 7\", \"amount\": \"381.86 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Therapy Sessions\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 7\", \"amount\": \"100.31 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Pest Control\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 7\", \"amount\": \"234.63 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Non-Profit Support\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 6\", \"amount\": \"40.4 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Jeans\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 6\", \"amount\": \"499.38 $\"}\\n] Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900,500] to [100,500] was successful. The \\'Expense Logs\\' screen scrolled upwards, revealing older expense entries. The list of expenses on the screen changed from those dated Oct 11-Oct 6 to those dated Oct 6-Oct 2. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of recording all expenses. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory will be updated with the expenses that were visible *before* this swipe.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Record the currently visible expenses in memory and then swipe up from the bottom of the screen (around [900, 500]) towards the top (around [100, 500]) to scroll down the expense list. This will reveal if there are more expenses to record.

The \"Expense Logs\" screen scrolled upwards, revealing older expense entries. The list of expenses changed from those dated Oct 6 - Oct 2 (as seen in the first screenshot) to those dated Oct 3 - Oct 1 (as seen in the second screenshot). This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of recording all expenses. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory will now be updated with the 11 expenses that were visible *before* this swipe (from \"Car Maintenance\" on Oct 6 to \"School Supplies\" on Oct 2). The next planned action will be to swipe again to check for more expenses, after which the expenses currently visible (from \"Freelance Payment\" on Oct 3 to \"Jeans\" on Oct 1) will be recorded.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform a swipe up from the bottom of the screen (around [900, 500]) towards the top (around [100, 500]) to scroll down the expense list. This will reveal if there are more expenses to record. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory will be updated in the subsequent step by appending the following 8 expenses currently visible and not yet recorded: \\n[\\n  {\"description\": \"Snacks\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 2\", \"amount\": \"324.58 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Restaurant Meal\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 2\", \"amount\": \"210.35 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Gym Membership\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 2\", \"amount\": \"164.38 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Dental Care\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 1\", \"amount\": \"364.55 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Tuition Fees\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 1\", \"amount\": \"469.15 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Property Taxes\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 1\", \"amount\": \"352.19 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Jeans\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 1\", \"amount\": \"496.36 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Jeans\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 1\", \"amount\": \"496.36 $\"}\\n] Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900,500] to [100,500] was performed. However, the list of expenses on the screen did not change, remaining the same as before the swipe (displaying items from \"Freelance Payment\" on Oct 3 to \"Jeans\" on Oct 1). This signifies that the end of the scrollable expense list has been reached. The action was successful in confirming that no more expenses are available by scrolling. The 8 expenses that were visible before this swipe and not yet recorded will now be added to the `AllExpenseDetails` memory.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[317,289],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Expense Logs\" option in the navigation drawer. This option is currently visible and located around [317, 289]. This action is expected to close the navigation drawer and display the list of expenses. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \"Expense Logs\" was successful. The application transitioned from the view with the open navigation drawer to the \"Expense Logs\" screen. This screen presents a list of expenses, each showing details such as the expense name, date, and amount. This outcome directly completes Subgoal 2 (\"Navigate to Expense List\") because the list of all expenses is now visible. The agent is now ready to proceed with recording these expenses.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Record the currently visible expenses in memory and then swipe up from the bottom of the screen (around [900, 500]) towards the top (around [100, 500]) to scroll down the expense list. This will reveal if there are more expenses to record. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory will be updated with the following: \\n[\\n  {\"description\": \"Membership Fees\", \"date_time\": \"Today 3:00 PM\", \"amount\": \"418.6 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Workshops\", \"date_time\": \"Today 10:00 AM\", \"amount\": \"329.99 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Dividends\", \"date_time\": \"Today 10:00 AM\", \"amount\": \"188.1 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Educational\", \"date_time\": \"Today 7:00 AM\", \"amount\": \"376.97 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Video Games\", \"date_time\": \"Yesterday 1:00 PM\", \"amount\": \"370.81 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Dining Out\", \"date_time\": \"Yesterday 11:00 AM\", \"amount\": \"223.5 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Dividends\", \"date_time\": \"Yesterday 4:00 AM\", \"amount\": \"150.73 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Snacks\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 13\", \"amount\": \"33.88 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Magazines\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 13\", \"amount\": \"185.23 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Educational Software\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 13\", \"amount\": \"78.19 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Jeans\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 12\", \"amount\": \"500.1 $\"}\\n] Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900,500] to [100,500] successfully scrolled the \\'Expense Logs\\' screen upwards, revealing older expense entries. The list of expenses on the screen has changed. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of recording all expenses, as it allows more expenses to be viewed and subsequently recorded. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory is being updated with the expenses visible *before* this swipe, and the next step will be to process the currently visible expenses and scroll again.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Record the currently visible expenses in memory and then swipe up from the bottom of the screen (around [900, 500]) towards the top (around [100, 500]) to scroll down the expense list. This will reveal if there are more expenses to record. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory will be updated by appending the following:\\n[\\n  {\"description\": \"Jeans\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 11\", \"amount\": \"501.98 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Non-Profit Support\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 11\", \"amount\": \"372 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Car Insurance\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 10\", \"amount\": \"232.66 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Shirt Purchase\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 10\", \"amount\": \"43.79 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Charity Donations\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 9\", \"amount\": \"369.65 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Restaurant Meal\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 7\", \"amount\": \"32.37 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Concert Tickets\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 7\", \"amount\": \"381.86 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Therapy Sessions\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 7\", \"amount\": \"100.31 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Pest Control\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 7\", \"amount\": \"234.63 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Non-Profit Support\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 6\", \"amount\": \"40.4 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Jeans\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 6\", \"amount\": \"499.38 $\"}\\n] Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900,500] to [100,500] was successful. The \\'Expense Logs\\' screen scrolled upwards, revealing older expense entries. The list of expenses on the screen changed from those dated Oct 11-Oct 6 to those dated Oct 6-Oct 2. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of recording all expenses. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory will be updated with the expenses that were visible *before* this swipe.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Record the currently visible expenses in memory and then swipe up from the bottom of the screen (around [900, 500]) towards the top (around [100, 500]) to scroll down the expense list. This will reveal if there are more expenses to record. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory will be updated by appending the following:\\n[\\n  {\"description\": \"Car Maintenance\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 6\", \"amount\": \"314.82 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"New Jacket\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 5\", \"amount\": \"155.71 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Laundry\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 5\", \"amount\": \"496.13 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Furnishing\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 5\", \"amount\": \"489.24 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Consulting Fees\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 5\", \"amount\": \"452.32 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Wedding Gift\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 4\", \"amount\": \"362.97 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Utilities\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 3\", \"amount\": \"367.51 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Seminars\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 3\", \"amount\": \"155.07 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Food Delivery\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 3\", \"amount\": \"302.85 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Freelance Payment\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 3\", \"amount\": \"250.11 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"School Supplies\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 2\", \"amount\": \"367.54 $\"}\\n] Actual Outcome: The swipe action (Step 7) was successful. The \"Expense Logs\" screen scrolled upwards, revealing older expense entries. The list of expenses changed from those dated Oct 6 - Oct 2 (as seen in the first screenshot) to those dated Oct 3 - Oct 1 (as seen in the second screenshot). This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of recording all expenses. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory will now be updated with the 11 expenses that were visible *before* this swipe (from \"Car Maintenance\" on Oct 6 to \"School Supplies\" on Oct 2). The next planned action will be to swipe again to check for more expenses, after which the expenses currently visible (from \"Freelance Payment\" on Oct 3 to \"Jeans\" on Oct 1) will be recorded.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform a swipe up from the bottom of the screen (around [900, 500]) towards the top (around [100, 500]) to scroll down the expense list. This will reveal if there are more expenses to record. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory will be updated in the subsequent step by appending the following 8 expenses currently visible and not yet recorded: \\n[\\n  {\"description\": \"Snacks\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 2\", \"amount\": \"324.58 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Restaurant Meal\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 2\", \"amount\": \"210.35 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Gym Membership\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 2\", \"amount\": \"164.38 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Dental Care\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 1\", \"amount\": \"364.55 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Tuition Fees\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 1\", \"amount\": \"469.15 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Property Taxes\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 1\", \"amount\": \"352.19 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Jeans\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 1\", \"amount\": \"496.36 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Jeans\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 1\", \"amount\": \"496.36 $\"}\\n] Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900,500] to [100,500] was performed. However, the list of expenses on the screen did not change, remaining the same as before the swipe (displaying items from \"Freelance Payment\" on Oct 3 to \"Jeans\" on Oct 1). This signifies that the end of the scrollable expense list has been reached. The action was successful in confirming that no more expenses are available by scrolling. The 8 expenses that were visible before this swipe and not yet recorded will now be added to the `AllExpenseDetails` memory. This completes the process of recording all expenses, and thus Subgoal 3.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 9: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[833,265],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the description text \"Jeans\" of the second (bottom-most) duplicate expense entry. The text \"Jeans\" is located at bounding box [824, 207, 842, 323]. This action is an attempt to reveal a context menu or selection mode that might offer a delete option for the expense.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The \"Expense Logs\" screen scrolled upwards, revealing older expense entries. The list of expenses changed from those dated Oct 6 - Oct 2 (as seen in the first screenshot) to those dated Oct 3 - Oct 1 (as seen in the second screenshot). This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of recording all expenses. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory will now be updated with the 11 expenses that were visible *before* this swipe (from \"Car Maintenance\" on Oct 6 to \"School Supplies\" on Oct 2). The next planned action will be to swipe again to check for more expenses, after which the expenses currently visible (from \"Freelance Payment\" on Oct 3 to \"Jeans\" on Oct 1) will be recorded.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform a swipe up from the bottom of the screen (around [900, 500]) towards the top (around [100, 500]) to scroll down the expense list. This will reveal if there are more expenses to record. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory will be updated in the subsequent step by appending the following 8 expenses currently visible and not yet recorded: \\n[\\n  {\"description\": \"Snacks\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 2\", \"amount\": \"324.58 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Restaurant Meal\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 2\", \"amount\": \"210.35 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Gym Membership\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 2\", \"amount\": \"164.38 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Dental Care\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 1\", \"amount\": \"364.55 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Tuition Fees\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 1\", \"amount\": \"469.15 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Property Taxes\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 1\", \"amount\": \"352.19 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Jeans\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 1\", \"amount\": \"496.36 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Jeans\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 1\", \"amount\": \"496.36 $\"}\\n] Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900,500] to [100,500] was performed. However, the list of expenses on the screen did not change, remaining the same as before the swipe (displaying items from \"Freelance Payment\" on Oct 3 to \"Jeans\" on Oct 1). This signifies that the end of the scrollable expense list has been reached. The action was successful in confirming that no more expenses are available by scrolling. The 8 expenses that were visible before this swipe and not yet recorded will now be added to the `AllExpenseDetails` memory. This completes the process of recording all expenses, and thus Subgoal 3.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[833,265],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the description text \"Jeans\" of the second (bottom-most) duplicate expense entry. The text \"Jeans\" is located at bounding box [824, 207, 842, 323]. This action is an attempt to reveal a context menu or selection mode that might offer a delete option for the expense. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the duplicate \"Jeans\" expense item was successful. It selected the item and made a \"Delete\" button appear on the right side of the screen, aligned with the selected item. The text \"Delete\" is visible on this button. This action has successfully identified the mechanism for deleting an expense and has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of deleting duplicate expenses. The next step is to tap this \"Delete\" button.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This will reveal if there are more expenses to record.

The list of expenses on the screen has changed. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of recording all expenses, as it allows more expenses to be viewed and subsequently recorded. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory is being updated with the expenses visible *before* this swipe, and the next step will be to process the currently visible expenses and scroll again.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Record the currently visible expenses in memory and then swipe up from the bottom of the screen (around [900, 500]) towards the top (around [100, 500]) to scroll down the expense list. This will reveal if there are more expenses to record.

The \\'Expense Logs\\' screen scrolled upwards, revealing older expense entries. The list of expenses on the screen changed from those dated Oct 11-Oct 6 to those dated Oct 6-Oct 2. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of recording all expenses. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory will be updated with the expenses that were visible *before* this swipe.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Record the currently visible expenses in memory and then swipe up from the bottom of the screen (around [900, 500]) towards the top (around [100, 500]) to scroll down the expense list. This will reveal if there are more expenses to record. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory will be updated by appending the following:\\n[\\n  {\"description\": \"Car Maintenance\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 6\", \"amount\": \"314.82 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"New Jacket\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 5\", \"amount\": \"155.71 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Laundry\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 5\", \"amount\": \"496.13 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Furnishing\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 5\", \"amount\": \"489.24 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Consulting Fees\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 5\", \"amount\": \"452.32 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Wedding Gift\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 4\", \"amount\": \"362.97 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Utilities\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 3\", \"amount\": \"367.51 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Seminars\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 3\", \"amount\": \"155.07 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Food Delivery\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 3\", \"amount\": \"302.85 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Freelance Payment\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 3\", \"amount\": \"250.11 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"School Supplies\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 2\", \"amount\": \"367.54 $\"}\\n] Actual Outcome: The swipe action (Step 7) was successful. The \"Expense Logs\" screen scrolled upwards, revealing older expense entries. The list of expenses changed from those dated Oct 6 - Oct 2 (as seen in the first screenshot) to those dated Oct 3 - Oct 1 (as seen in the second screenshot). This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of recording all expenses. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory will now be updated with the 11 expenses that were visible *before* this swipe (from \"Car Maintenance\" on Oct 6 to \"School Supplies\" on Oct 2). The next planned action will be to swipe again to check for more expenses, after which the expenses currently visible (from \"Freelance Payment\" on Oct 3 to \"Jeans\" on Oct 1) will be recorded.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform a swipe up from the bottom of the screen (around [900, 500]) towards the top (around [100, 500]) to scroll down the expense list. This will reveal if there are more expenses to record. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory will be updated in the subsequent step by appending the following 8 expenses currently visible and not yet recorded: \\n[\\n  {\"description\": \"Snacks\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 2\", \"amount\": \"324.58 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Restaurant Meal\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 2\", \"amount\": \"210.35 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Gym Membership\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 2\", \"amount\": \"164.38 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Dental Care\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 1\", \"amount\": \"364.55 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Tuition Fees\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 1\", \"amount\": \"469.15 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Property Taxes\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 1\", \"amount\": \"352.19 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Jeans\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 1\", \"amount\": \"496.36 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Jeans\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 1\", \"amount\": \"496.36 $\"}\\n] Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900,500] to [100,500] was performed. However, the list of expenses on the screen did not change, remaining the same as before the swipe (displaying items from \"Freelance Payment\" on Oct 3 to \"Jeans\" on Oct 1). This signifies that the end of the scrollable expense list has been reached. The action was successful in confirming that no more expenses are available by scrolling. The 8 expenses that were visible before this swipe and not yet recorded will now be added to the `AllExpenseDetails` memory. This completes the process of recording all expenses, and thus Subgoal 3.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[833,265],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the description text \"Jeans\" of the second (bottom-most) duplicate expense entry. The text \"Jeans\" is located at bounding box [824, 207, 842, 323]. This action is an attempt to reveal a context menu or selection mode that might offer a delete option for the expense. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the duplicate \"Jeans\" expense item was successful. It selected the item and made a \"Delete\" button appear on the right side of the screen, aligned with the selected item. The text \"Delete\" is visible on this button. This action has successfully identified the mechanism for deleting an expense and has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of deleting duplicate expenses. The next step is to tap this \"Delete\" button.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 10: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[867,898],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Delete\\' button, which is currently visible on the right side of the selected \\'Jeans\\' expense. The button has the text \\'Delete\\' and its bounding box is [857, 846, 877, 951]. This action is expected to delete the selected expense item. A confirmation dialog might appear, or the item might be deleted directly.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The `AllExpenseDetails` memory will be updated by appending the following:\\n[\\n  {\"description\": \"Jeans\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 11\", \"amount\": \"501.98 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Non-Profit Support\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 11\", \"amount\": \"372 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Car Insurance\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 10\", \"amount\": \"232.66 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Shirt Purchase\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 10\", \"amount\": \"43.79 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Charity Donations\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 9\", \"amount\": \"369.65 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Restaurant Meal\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 7\", \"amount\": \"32.37 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Concert Tickets\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 7\", \"amount\": \"381.86 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Therapy Sessions\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 7\", \"amount\": \"100.31 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Pest Control\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 7\", \"amount\": \"234.63 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Non-Profit Support\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 6\", \"amount\": \"40.4 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Jeans\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 6\", \"amount\": \"499.38 $\"}\\n] Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900,500] to [100,500] was successful. The \\'Expense Logs\\' screen scrolled upwards, revealing older expense entries. The list of expenses on the screen changed from those dated Oct 11-Oct 6 to those dated Oct 6-Oct 2. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of recording all expenses. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory will be updated with the expenses that were visible *before* this swipe.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Record the currently visible expenses in memory and then swipe up from the bottom of the screen (around [900, 500]) towards the top (around [100, 500]) to scroll down the expense list. This will reveal if there are more expenses to record. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory will be updated by appending the following:\\n[\\n  {\"description\": \"Car Maintenance\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 6\", \"amount\": \"314.82 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"New Jacket\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 5\", \"amount\": \"155.71 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Laundry\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 5\", \"amount\": \"496.13 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Furnishing\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 5\", \"amount\": \"489.24 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Consulting Fees\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 5\", \"amount\": \"452.32 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Wedding Gift\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 4\", \"amount\": \"362.97 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Utilities\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 3\", \"amount\": \"367.51 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Seminars\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 3\", \"amount\": \"155.07 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Food Delivery\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 3\", \"amount\": \"302.85 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Freelance Payment\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 3\", \"amount\": \"250.11 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"School Supplies\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 2\", \"amount\": \"367.54 $\"}\\n] Actual Outcome: The swipe action (Step 7) was successful. The \"Expense Logs\" screen scrolled upwards, revealing older expense entries. The list of expenses changed from those dated Oct 6 - Oct 2 (as seen in the first screenshot) to those dated Oct 3 - Oct 1 (as seen in the second screenshot). This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of recording all expenses. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory will now be updated with the 11 expenses that were visible *before* this swipe (from \"Car Maintenance\" on Oct 6 to \"School Supplies\" on Oct 2). The next planned action will be to swipe again to check for more expenses, after which the expenses currently visible (from \"Freelance Payment\" on Oct 3 to \"Jeans\" on Oct 1) will be recorded.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform a swipe up from the bottom of the screen (around [900, 500]) towards the top (around [100, 500]) to scroll down the expense list. This will reveal if there are more expenses to record. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory will be updated in the subsequent step by appending the following 8 expenses currently visible and not yet recorded: \\n[\\n  {\"description\": \"Snacks\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 2\", \"amount\": \"324.58 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Restaurant Meal\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 2\", \"amount\": \"210.35 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Gym Membership\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 2\", \"amount\": \"164.38 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Dental Care\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 1\", \"amount\": \"364.55 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Tuition Fees\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 1\", \"amount\": \"469.15 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Property Taxes\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 1\", \"amount\": \"352.19 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Jeans\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 1\", \"amount\": \"496.36 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Jeans\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 1\", \"amount\": \"496.36 $\"}\\n] Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900,500] to [100,500] was performed. However, the list of expenses on the screen did not change, remaining the same as before the swipe (displaying items from \"Freelance Payment\" on Oct 3 to \"Jeans\" on Oct 1). This signifies that the end of the scrollable expense list has been reached. The action was successful in confirming that no more expenses are available by scrolling. The 8 expenses that were visible before this swipe and not yet recorded will now be added to the `AllExpenseDetails` memory. This completes the process of recording all expenses, and thus Subgoal 3.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[833,265],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the description text \"Jeans\" of the second (bottom-most) duplicate expense entry. The text \"Jeans\" is located at bounding box [824, 207, 842, 323]. This action is an attempt to reveal a context menu or selection mode that might offer a delete option for the expense. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the duplicate \"Jeans\" expense item was successful. It selected the item and made a \"Delete\" button appear on the right side of the screen, aligned with the selected item. The text \"Delete\" is visible on this button. This action has successfully identified the mechanism for deleting an expense and has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of deleting duplicate expenses. The next step is to tap this \"Delete\" button.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[867,898],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Delete\\' button, which is currently visible on the right side of the selected \\'Jeans\\' expense. The button has the text \\'Delete\\' and its bounding box is [857, 846, 877, 951]. This action is expected to delete the selected expense item. A confirmation dialog might appear, or the item might be deleted directly. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Delete\\' button successfully removed the selected duplicate \\'Jeans\\' expense item from the list. The screen updated to reflect this change, with the item and the \\'Delete\\' button disappearing. This action completed the task of deleting the identified duplicate expense, thus completing Subgoal 4.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The \"Expense Logs\" screen scrolled upwards, revealing older expense entries. The list of expenses changed from those dated Oct 6 - Oct 2 (as seen in the first screenshot) to those dated Oct 3 - Oct 1 (as seen in the second screenshot). This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of recording all expenses. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory will now be updated with the 11 expenses that were visible *before* this swipe (from \"Car Maintenance\" on Oct 6 to \"School Supplies\" on Oct 2). The next planned action will be to swipe again to check for more expenses, after which the expenses currently visible (from \"Freelance Payment\" on Oct 3 to \"Jeans\" on Oct 1) will be recorded.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform a swipe up from the bottom of the screen (around [900, 500]) towards the top (around [100, 500]) to scroll down the expense list. This will reveal if there are more expenses to record. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory will be updated in the subsequent step by appending the following 8 expenses currently visible and not yet recorded: \\n[\\n  {\"description\": \"Snacks\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 2\", \"amount\": \"324.58 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Restaurant Meal\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 2\", \"amount\": \"210.35 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Gym Membership\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 2\", \"amount\": \"164.38 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Dental Care\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 1\", \"amount\": \"364.55 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Tuition Fees\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 1\", \"amount\": \"469.15 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Property Taxes\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 1\", \"amount\": \"352.19 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Jeans\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 1\", \"amount\": \"496.36 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Jeans\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 1\", \"amount\": \"496.36 $\"}\\n] Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900,500] to [100,500] was performed. However, the list of expenses on the screen did not change, remaining the same as before the swipe (displaying items from \"Freelance Payment\" on Oct 3 to \"Jeans\" on Oct 1). This signifies that the end of the scrollable expense list has been reached. The action was successful in confirming that no more expenses are available by scrolling. The 8 expenses that were visible before this swipe and not yet recorded will now be added to the `AllExpenseDetails` memory. This completes the process of recording all expenses, and thus Subgoal 3.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[833,265],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the description text \"Jeans\" of the second (bottom-most) duplicate expense entry. The text \"Jeans\" is located at bounding box [824, 207, 842, 323]. This action is an attempt to reveal a context menu or selection mode that might offer a delete option for the expense. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the duplicate \"Jeans\" expense item was successful. It selected the item and made a \"Delete\" button appear on the right side of the screen, aligned with the selected item. The text \"Delete\" is visible on this button. This action has successfully identified the mechanism for deleting an expense and has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of deleting duplicate expenses. The next step is to tap this \"Delete\" button.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[867,898],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Delete\\' button, which is currently visible on the right side of the selected \\'Jeans\\' expense. The button has the text \\'Delete\\' and its bounding box is [857, 846, 877, 951]. This action is expected to delete the selected expense item. A confirmation dialog might appear, or the item might be deleted directly. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Delete\\' button successfully removed the selected duplicate \\'Jeans\\' expense item from the list. The screen updated to reflect this change, with the item and the \\'Delete\\' button disappearing. This action completed the task of deleting the identified duplicate expense, thus completing Subgoal 4.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 11: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[200,500],\"end_point\":[800,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe downwards on the screen (from [200, 500] to [800, 500]) to scroll the expense list content down, effectively moving the view to the top of the list. This is to verify the state of the expense list after the reported deletion of a duplicate item and to move away from the potentially inconsistent UI elements at the bottom of the current view.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This will reveal if there are more expenses to record. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory will be updated by appending the following:\\n[\\n  {\"description\": \"Car Maintenance\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 6\", \"amount\": \"314.82 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"New Jacket\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 5\", \"amount\": \"155.71 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Laundry\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 5\", \"amount\": \"496.13 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Furnishing\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 5\", \"amount\": \"489.24 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Consulting Fees\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 5\", \"amount\": \"452.32 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Wedding Gift\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 4\", \"amount\": \"362.97 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Utilities\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 3\", \"amount\": \"367.51 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Seminars\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 3\", \"amount\": \"155.07 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Food Delivery\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 3\", \"amount\": \"302.85 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Freelance Payment\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 3\", \"amount\": \"250.11 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"School Supplies\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 2\", \"amount\": \"367.54 $\"}\\n] Actual Outcome: The swipe action (Step 7) was successful. The \"Expense Logs\" screen scrolled upwards, revealing older expense entries. The list of expenses changed from those dated Oct 6 - Oct 2 (as seen in the first screenshot) to those dated Oct 3 - Oct 1 (as seen in the second screenshot). This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of recording all expenses. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory will now be updated with the 11 expenses that were visible *before* this swipe (from \"Car Maintenance\" on Oct 6 to \"School Supplies\" on Oct 2). The next planned action will be to swipe again to check for more expenses, after which the expenses currently visible (from \"Freelance Payment\" on Oct 3 to \"Jeans\" on Oct 1) will be recorded.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform a swipe up from the bottom of the screen (around [900, 500]) towards the top (around [100, 500]) to scroll down the expense list. This will reveal if there are more expenses to record. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory will be updated in the subsequent step by appending the following 8 expenses currently visible and not yet recorded: \\n[\\n  {\"description\": \"Snacks\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 2\", \"amount\": \"324.58 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Restaurant Meal\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 2\", \"amount\": \"210.35 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Gym Membership\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 2\", \"amount\": \"164.38 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Dental Care\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 1\", \"amount\": \"364.55 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Tuition Fees\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 1\", \"amount\": \"469.15 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Property Taxes\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 1\", \"amount\": \"352.19 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Jeans\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 1\", \"amount\": \"496.36 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Jeans\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 1\", \"amount\": \"496.36 $\"}\\n] Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900,500] to [100,500] was performed. However, the list of expenses on the screen did not change, remaining the same as before the swipe (displaying items from \"Freelance Payment\" on Oct 3 to \"Jeans\" on Oct 1). This signifies that the end of the scrollable expense list has been reached. The action was successful in confirming that no more expenses are available by scrolling. The 8 expenses that were visible before this swipe and not yet recorded will now be added to the `AllExpenseDetails` memory. This completes the process of recording all expenses, and thus Subgoal 3.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[833,265],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the description text \"Jeans\" of the second (bottom-most) duplicate expense entry. The text \"Jeans\" is located at bounding box [824, 207, 842, 323]. This action is an attempt to reveal a context menu or selection mode that might offer a delete option for the expense. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the duplicate \"Jeans\" expense item was successful. It selected the item and made a \"Delete\" button appear on the right side of the screen, aligned with the selected item. The text \"Delete\" is visible on this button. This action has successfully identified the mechanism for deleting an expense and has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of deleting duplicate expenses. The next step is to tap this \"Delete\" button.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[867,898],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Delete\\' button, which is currently visible on the right side of the selected \\'Jeans\\' expense. The button has the text \\'Delete\\' and its bounding box is [857, 846, 877, 951]. This action is expected to delete the selected expense item. A confirmation dialog might appear, or the item might be deleted directly. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Delete\\' button successfully removed the selected duplicate \\'Jeans\\' expense item from the list. The screen updated to reflect this change, with the item and the \\'Delete\\' button disappearing. This action completed the task of deleting the identified duplicate expense, thus completing Subgoal 4.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[200,500],\"end_point\":[800,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe downwards on the screen (from [200, 500] to [800, 500]) to scroll the expense list content down, effectively moving the view to the top of the list. This is to verify the state of the expense list after the reported deletion of a duplicate item and to move away from the potentially inconsistent UI elements at the bottom of the current view. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [200,500] to [800,500] (a downward swipe on the screen) was successful. The expense list scrolled, revealing earlier dated entries (e.g., \"New Jacket Oct 5\" is now visible, whereas previously items from Oct 3 and earlier were at the top of the visible list). This means the view has moved towards the top of the overall expense list. If an item was selected and a \"Delete\" button was visible (as suggested by the first screenshot), the swipe action appears to have deselected it, as the \"Delete\" button is no longer visible in the second screenshot. This action moves the agent closer to verifying the deletion by allowing continued scrolling of the list.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The `AllExpenseDetails` memory will be updated by appending the following:\\n[\\n  {\"description\": \"Car Maintenance\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 6\", \"amount\": \"314.82 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"New Jacket\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 5\", \"amount\": \"155.71 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Laundry\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 5\", \"amount\": \"496.13 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Furnishing\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 5\", \"amount\": \"489.24 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Consulting Fees\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 5\", \"amount\": \"452.32 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Wedding Gift\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 4\", \"amount\": \"362.97 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Utilities\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 3\", \"amount\": \"367.51 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Seminars\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 3\", \"amount\": \"155.07 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Food Delivery\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 3\", \"amount\": \"302.85 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Freelance Payment\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 3\", \"amount\": \"250.11 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"School Supplies\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 2\", \"amount\": \"367.54 $\"}\\n] Actual Outcome: The swipe action (Step 7) was successful. The \"Expense Logs\" screen scrolled upwards, revealing older expense entries. The list of expenses changed from those dated Oct 6 - Oct 2 (as seen in the first screenshot) to those dated Oct 3 - Oct 1 (as seen in the second screenshot). This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of recording all expenses. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory will now be updated with the 11 expenses that were visible *before* this swipe (from \"Car Maintenance\" on Oct 6 to \"School Supplies\" on Oct 2). The next planned action will be to swipe again to check for more expenses, after which the expenses currently visible (from \"Freelance Payment\" on Oct 3 to \"Jeans\" on Oct 1) will be recorded.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform a swipe up from the bottom of the screen (around [900, 500]) towards the top (around [100, 500]) to scroll down the expense list. This will reveal if there are more expenses to record. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory will be updated in the subsequent step by appending the following 8 expenses currently visible and not yet recorded: \\n[\\n  {\"description\": \"Snacks\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 2\", \"amount\": \"324.58 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Restaurant Meal\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 2\", \"amount\": \"210.35 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Gym Membership\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 2\", \"amount\": \"164.38 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Dental Care\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 1\", \"amount\": \"364.55 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Tuition Fees\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 1\", \"amount\": \"469.15 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Property Taxes\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 1\", \"amount\": \"352.19 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Jeans\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 1\", \"amount\": \"496.36 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Jeans\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 1\", \"amount\": \"496.36 $\"}\\n] Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900,500] to [100,500] was performed. However, the list of expenses on the screen did not change, remaining the same as before the swipe (displaying items from \"Freelance Payment\" on Oct 3 to \"Jeans\" on Oct 1). This signifies that the end of the scrollable expense list has been reached. The action was successful in confirming that no more expenses are available by scrolling. The 8 expenses that were visible before this swipe and not yet recorded will now be added to the `AllExpenseDetails` memory. This completes the process of recording all expenses, and thus Subgoal 3.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[833,265],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the description text \"Jeans\" of the second (bottom-most) duplicate expense entry. The text \"Jeans\" is located at bounding box [824, 207, 842, 323]. This action is an attempt to reveal a context menu or selection mode that might offer a delete option for the expense. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the duplicate \"Jeans\" expense item was successful. It selected the item and made a \"Delete\" button appear on the right side of the screen, aligned with the selected item. The text \"Delete\" is visible on this button. This action has successfully identified the mechanism for deleting an expense and has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of deleting duplicate expenses. The next step is to tap this \"Delete\" button.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[867,898],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Delete\\' button, which is currently visible on the right side of the selected \\'Jeans\\' expense. The button has the text \\'Delete\\' and its bounding box is [857, 846, 877, 951]. This action is expected to delete the selected expense item. A confirmation dialog might appear, or the item might be deleted directly. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Delete\\' button successfully removed the selected duplicate \\'Jeans\\' expense item from the list. The screen updated to reflect this change, with the item and the \\'Delete\\' button disappearing. This action completed the task of deleting the identified duplicate expense, thus completing Subgoal 4.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[200,500],\"end_point\":[800,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe downwards on the screen (from [200, 500] to [800, 500]) to scroll the expense list content down, effectively moving the view to the top of the list. This is to verify the state of the expense list after the reported deletion of a duplicate item and to move away from the potentially inconsistent UI elements at the bottom of the current view. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [200,500] to [800,500] (a downward swipe on the screen) was successful. The expense list scrolled, revealing earlier dated entries (e.g., \"New Jacket Oct 5\" is now visible, whereas previously items from Oct 3 and earlier were at the top of the visible list). This means the view has moved towards the top of the overall expense list. If an item was selected and a \"Delete\" button was visible (as suggested by the first screenshot), the swipe action appears to have deselected it, as the \"Delete\" button is no longer visible in the second screenshot. This action moves the agent closer to verifying the deletion by allowing continued scrolling of the list.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 12: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[200,500],\"end_point\":[800,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe downwards on the screen (from [200, 500] to [800, 500]) to scroll the expense list content down, effectively moving the view further towards the top of the list. This is to continue the process of reaching the top of the list for verification.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This will reveal if there are more expenses to record. The `AllExpenseDetails` memory will be updated in the subsequent step by appending the following 8 expenses currently visible and not yet recorded: \\n[\\n  {\"description\": \"Snacks\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 2\", \"amount\": \"324.58 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Restaurant Meal\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 2\", \"amount\": \"210.35 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Gym Membership\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 2\", \"amount\": \"164.38 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Dental Care\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 1\", \"amount\": \"364.55 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Tuition Fees\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 1\", \"amount\": \"469.15 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Property Taxes\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 1\", \"amount\": \"352.19 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Jeans\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 1\", \"amount\": \"496.36 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Jeans\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 1\", \"amount\": \"496.36 $\"}\\n] Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900,500] to [100,500] was performed. However, the list of expenses on the screen did not change, remaining the same as before the swipe (displaying items from \"Freelance Payment\" on Oct 3 to \"Jeans\" on Oct 1). This signifies that the end of the scrollable expense list has been reached. The action was successful in confirming that no more expenses are available by scrolling. The 8 expenses that were visible before this swipe and not yet recorded will now be added to the `AllExpenseDetails` memory. This completes the process of recording all expenses, and thus Subgoal 3.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[833,265],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the description text \"Jeans\" of the second (bottom-most) duplicate expense entry. The text \"Jeans\" is located at bounding box [824, 207, 842, 323]. This action is an attempt to reveal a context menu or selection mode that might offer a delete option for the expense. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the duplicate \"Jeans\" expense item was successful. It selected the item and made a \"Delete\" button appear on the right side of the screen, aligned with the selected item. The text \"Delete\" is visible on this button. This action has successfully identified the mechanism for deleting an expense and has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of deleting duplicate expenses. The next step is to tap this \"Delete\" button.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[867,898],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Delete\\' button, which is currently visible on the right side of the selected \\'Jeans\\' expense. The button has the text \\'Delete\\' and its bounding box is [857, 846, 877, 951]. This action is expected to delete the selected expense item. A confirmation dialog might appear, or the item might be deleted directly. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Delete\\' button successfully removed the selected duplicate \\'Jeans\\' expense item from the list. The screen updated to reflect this change, with the item and the \\'Delete\\' button disappearing. This action completed the task of deleting the identified duplicate expense, thus completing Subgoal 4.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[200,500],\"end_point\":[800,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe downwards on the screen (from [200, 500] to [800, 500]) to scroll the expense list content down, effectively moving the view to the top of the list. This is to verify the state of the expense list after the reported deletion of a duplicate item and to move away from the potentially inconsistent UI elements at the bottom of the current view. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [200,500] to [800,500] (a downward swipe on the screen) was successful. The expense list scrolled, revealing earlier dated entries (e.g., \"New Jacket Oct 5\" is now visible, whereas previously items from Oct 3 and earlier were at the top of the visible list). This means the view has moved towards the top of the overall expense list. If an item was selected and a \"Delete\" button was visible (as suggested by the first screenshot), the swipe action appears to have deselected it, as the \"Delete\" button is no longer visible in the second screenshot. This action moves the agent closer to verifying the deletion by allowing continued scrolling of the list.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[200,500],\"end_point\":[800,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe downwards on the screen (from [200, 500] to [800, 500]) to scroll the expense list content down, effectively moving the view further towards the top of the list. This is to continue the process of reaching the top of the list for verification. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [200,500] to [800,500] successfully scrolled the expense list upwards. The visible items changed from those starting with \"New Jacket 2023 Oct 5\" to those starting with \"Shirt Purchase 2023 Oct 10\". This action brings the agent closer to reaching the top of the expense list, which is a prerequisite for verifying the deletion of the duplicate item.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The `AllExpenseDetails` memory will be updated in the subsequent step by appending the following 8 expenses currently visible and not yet recorded: \\n[\\n  {\"description\": \"Snacks\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 2\", \"amount\": \"324.58 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Restaurant Meal\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 2\", \"amount\": \"210.35 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Gym Membership\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 2\", \"amount\": \"164.38 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Dental Care\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 1\", \"amount\": \"364.55 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Tuition Fees\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 1\", \"amount\": \"469.15 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Property Taxes\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 1\", \"amount\": \"352.19 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Jeans\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 1\", \"amount\": \"496.36 $\"},\\n  {\"description\": \"Jeans\", \"date_time\": \"2023 Oct 1\", \"amount\": \"496.36 $\"}\\n] Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900,500] to [100,500] was performed. However, the list of expenses on the screen did not change, remaining the same as before the swipe (displaying items from \"Freelance Payment\" on Oct 3 to \"Jeans\" on Oct 1). This signifies that the end of the scrollable expense list has been reached. The action was successful in confirming that no more expenses are available by scrolling. The 8 expenses that were visible before this swipe and not yet recorded will now be added to the `AllExpenseDetails` memory. This completes the process of recording all expenses, and thus Subgoal 3.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[833,265],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the description text \"Jeans\" of the second (bottom-most) duplicate expense entry. The text \"Jeans\" is located at bounding box [824, 207, 842, 323]. This action is an attempt to reveal a context menu or selection mode that might offer a delete option for the expense. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the duplicate \"Jeans\" expense item was successful. It selected the item and made a \"Delete\" button appear on the right side of the screen, aligned with the selected item. The text \"Delete\" is visible on this button. This action has successfully identified the mechanism for deleting an expense and has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of deleting duplicate expenses. The next step is to tap this \"Delete\" button.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[867,898],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Delete\\' button, which is currently visible on the right side of the selected \\'Jeans\\' expense. The button has the text \\'Delete\\' and its bounding box is [857, 846, 877, 951]. This action is expected to delete the selected expense item. A confirmation dialog might appear, or the item might be deleted directly. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Delete\\' button successfully removed the selected duplicate \\'Jeans\\' expense item from the list. The screen updated to reflect this change, with the item and the \\'Delete\\' button disappearing. This action completed the task of deleting the identified duplicate expense, thus completing Subgoal 4.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[200,500],\"end_point\":[800,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe downwards on the screen (from [200, 500] to [800, 500]) to scroll the expense list content down, effectively moving the view to the top of the list. This is to verify the state of the expense list after the reported deletion of a duplicate item and to move away from the potentially inconsistent UI elements at the bottom of the current view. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [200,500] to [800,500] (a downward swipe on the screen) was successful. The expense list scrolled, revealing earlier dated entries (e.g., \"New Jacket Oct 5\" is now visible, whereas previously items from Oct 3 and earlier were at the top of the visible list). This means the view has moved towards the top of the overall expense list. If an item was selected and a \"Delete\" button was visible (as suggested by the first screenshot), the swipe action appears to have deselected it, as the \"Delete\" button is no longer visible in the second screenshot. This action moves the agent closer to verifying the deletion by allowing continued scrolling of the list.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[200,500],\"end_point\":[800,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe downwards on the screen (from [200, 500] to [800, 500]) to scroll the expense list content down, effectively moving the view further towards the top of the list. This is to continue the process of reaching the top of the list for verification. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [200,500] to [800,500] successfully scrolled the expense list upwards. The visible items changed from those starting with \"New Jacket 2023 Oct 5\" to those starting with \"Shirt Purchase 2023 Oct 10\". This action brings the agent closer to reaching the top of the expense list, which is a prerequisite for verifying the deletion of the duplicate item.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 13: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[200,500],\"end_point\":[800,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe downwards on the screen (from [200, 500] to [800, 500]) to scroll the expense list content down, effectively moving the view further towards the top of the list. This is to continue the process of reaching the top of the list for verification.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[833,265],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the description text \"Jeans\" of the second (bottom-most) duplicate expense entry. The text \"Jeans\" is located at bounding box [824, 207, 842, 323]. This action is an attempt to reveal a context menu or selection mode that might offer a delete option for the expense. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the duplicate \"Jeans\" expense item was successful. It selected the item and made a \"Delete\" button appear on the right side of the screen, aligned with the selected item. The text \"Delete\" is visible on this button. This action has successfully identified the mechanism for deleting an expense and has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of deleting duplicate expenses. The next step is to tap this \"Delete\" button.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[867,898],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Delete\\' button, which is currently visible on the right side of the selected \\'Jeans\\' expense. The button has the text \\'Delete\\' and its bounding box is [857, 846, 877, 951]. This action is expected to delete the selected expense item. A confirmation dialog might appear, or the item might be deleted directly. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Delete\\' button successfully removed the selected duplicate \\'Jeans\\' expense item from the list. The screen updated to reflect this change, with the item and the \\'Delete\\' button disappearing. This action completed the task of deleting the identified duplicate expense, thus completing Subgoal 4.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[200,500],\"end_point\":[800,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe downwards on the screen (from [200, 500] to [800, 500]) to scroll the expense list content down, effectively moving the view to the top of the list. This is to verify the state of the expense list after the reported deletion of a duplicate item and to move away from the potentially inconsistent UI elements at the bottom of the current view. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [200,500] to [800,500] (a downward swipe on the screen) was successful. The expense list scrolled, revealing earlier dated entries (e.g., \"New Jacket Oct 5\" is now visible, whereas previously items from Oct 3 and earlier were at the top of the visible list). This means the view has moved towards the top of the overall expense list. If an item was selected and a \"Delete\" button was visible (as suggested by the first screenshot), the swipe action appears to have deselected it, as the \"Delete\" button is no longer visible in the second screenshot. This action moves the agent closer to verifying the deletion by allowing continued scrolling of the list.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[200,500],\"end_point\":[800,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe downwards on the screen (from [200, 500] to [800, 500]) to scroll the expense list content down, effectively moving the view further towards the top of the list. This is to continue the process of reaching the top of the list for verification. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [200,500] to [800,500] successfully scrolled the expense list upwards. The visible items changed from those starting with \"New Jacket 2023 Oct 5\" to those starting with \"Shirt Purchase 2023 Oct 10\". This action brings the agent closer to reaching the top of the expense list, which is a prerequisite for verifying the deletion of the duplicate item.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[200,500],\"end_point\":[800,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe downwards on the screen (from [200, 500] to [800, 500]) to scroll the expense list content down, effectively moving the view further towards the top of the list. This is to continue the process of reaching the top of the list for verification. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [200,500] to [800,500] successfully scrolled the expense list upwards. The visible items changed, with \"Snacks 2023 Oct 13\" now at the top of the visible list, whereas previously \"Shirt Purchase 2023 Oct 10\" was at the top. This action brings the agent closer to reaching the top of the expense list, which is necessary for verifying the deletion of the duplicate item.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[833,265],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the description text \"Jeans\" of the second (bottom-most) duplicate expense entry. The text \"Jeans\" is located at bounding box [824, 207, 842, 323]. This action is an attempt to reveal a context menu or selection mode that might offer a delete option for the expense. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the duplicate \"Jeans\" expense item was successful. It selected the item and made a \"Delete\" button appear on the right side of the screen, aligned with the selected item. The text \"Delete\" is visible on this button. This action has successfully identified the mechanism for deleting an expense and has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of deleting duplicate expenses. The next step is to tap this \"Delete\" button.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[867,898],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Delete\\' button, which is currently visible on the right side of the selected \\'Jeans\\' expense. The button has the text \\'Delete\\' and its bounding box is [857, 846, 877, 951]. This action is expected to delete the selected expense item. A confirmation dialog might appear, or the item might be deleted directly. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Delete\\' button successfully removed the selected duplicate \\'Jeans\\' expense item from the list. The screen updated to reflect this change, with the item and the \\'Delete\\' button disappearing. This action completed the task of deleting the identified duplicate expense, thus completing Subgoal 4.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[200,500],\"end_point\":[800,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe downwards on the screen (from [200, 500] to [800, 500]) to scroll the expense list content down, effectively moving the view to the top of the list. This is to verify the state of the expense list after the reported deletion of a duplicate item and to move away from the potentially inconsistent UI elements at the bottom of the current view. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [200,500] to [800,500] (a downward swipe on the screen) was successful. The expense list scrolled, revealing earlier dated entries (e.g., \"New Jacket Oct 5\" is now visible, whereas previously items from Oct 3 and earlier were at the top of the visible list). This means the view has moved towards the top of the overall expense list. If an item was selected and a \"Delete\" button was visible (as suggested by the first screenshot), the swipe action appears to have deselected it, as the \"Delete\" button is no longer visible in the second screenshot. This action moves the agent closer to verifying the deletion by allowing continued scrolling of the list.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[200,500],\"end_point\":[800,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe downwards on the screen (from [200, 500] to [800, 500]) to scroll the expense list content down, effectively moving the view further towards the top of the list. This is to continue the process of reaching the top of the list for verification. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [200,500] to [800,500] successfully scrolled the expense list upwards. The visible items changed from those starting with \"New Jacket 2023 Oct 5\" to those starting with \"Shirt Purchase 2023 Oct 10\". This action brings the agent closer to reaching the top of the expense list, which is a prerequisite for verifying the deletion of the duplicate item.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[200,500],\"end_point\":[800,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe downwards on the screen (from [200, 500] to [800, 500]) to scroll the expense list content down, effectively moving the view further towards the top of the list. This is to continue the process of reaching the top of the list for verification. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [200,500] to [800,500] successfully scrolled the expense list upwards. The visible items changed, with \"Snacks 2023 Oct 13\" now at the top of the visible list, whereas previously \"Shirt Purchase 2023 Oct 10\" was at the top. This action brings the agent closer to reaching the top of the expense list, which is necessary for verifying the deletion of the duplicate item.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 14: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[200,500],\"end_point\":[800,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe downwards on the screen (from [200, 500] to [800, 500]) to scroll the expense list content up, moving the view further towards the top of the list.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Approximate bounding box: [595, 291, 698, 495]\",\"Status\":\"A complete piece of information.\"}]}\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[867,898],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Delete\\' button, which is currently visible on the right side of the selected \\'Jeans\\' expense. The button has the text \\'Delete\\' and its bounding box is [857, 846, 877, 951]. This action is expected to delete the selected expense item. A confirmation dialog might appear, or the item might be deleted directly. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Delete\\' button successfully removed the selected duplicate \\'Jeans\\' expense item from the list. The screen updated to reflect this change, with the item and the \\'Delete\\' button disappearing. This action completed the task of deleting the identified duplicate expense, thus completing Subgoal 4.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[200,500],\"end_point\":[800,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe downwards on the screen (from [200, 500] to [800, 500]) to scroll the expense list content down, effectively moving the view to the top of the list. This is to verify the state of the expense list after the reported deletion of a duplicate item and to move away from the potentially inconsistent UI elements at the bottom of the current view. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [200,500] to [800,500] (a downward swipe on the screen) was successful. The expense list scrolled, revealing earlier dated entries (e.g., \"New Jacket Oct 5\" is now visible, whereas previously items from Oct 3 and earlier were at the top of the visible list). This means the view has moved towards the top of the overall expense list. If an item was selected and a \"Delete\" button was visible (as suggested by the first screenshot), the swipe action appears to have deselected it, as the \"Delete\" button is no longer visible in the second screenshot. This action moves the agent closer to verifying the deletion by allowing continued scrolling of the list.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[200,500],\"end_point\":[800,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe downwards on the screen (from [200, 500] to [800, 500]) to scroll the expense list content down, effectively moving the view further towards the top of the list. This is to continue the process of reaching the top of the list for verification. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [200,500] to [800,500] successfully scrolled the expense list upwards. The visible items changed from those starting with \"New Jacket 2023 Oct 5\" to those starting with \"Shirt Purchase 2023 Oct 10\". This action brings the agent closer to reaching the top of the expense list, which is a prerequisite for verifying the deletion of the duplicate item.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[200,500],\"end_point\":[800,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe downwards on the screen (from [200, 500] to [800, 500]) to scroll the expense list content down, effectively moving the view further towards the top of the list. This is to continue the process of reaching the top of the list for verification. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [200,500] to [800,500] successfully scrolled the expense list upwards. The visible items changed, with \"Snacks 2023 Oct 13\" now at the top of the visible list, whereas previously \"Shirt Purchase 2023 Oct 10\" was at the top. This action brings the agent closer to reaching the top of the expense list, which is necessary for verifying the deletion of the duplicate item.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[200,500],\"end_point\":[800,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe downwards on the screen (from [200, 500] to [800, 500]) to scroll the expense list content up, moving the view further towards the top of the list. This is to continue the process of reaching the top of the list for verification. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [200,500] to [800,500] successfully scrolled the expense list to the top. The item \"Membership Fees Today 3:00 PM\" is now visible at the top of the screen, which matches the first item in the `AllExpenseDetails` memory. This confirms that the top of the list has been reached. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by fulfilling the prerequisite of reaching the top of the list before starting the verification scroll to the bottom.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[867,898],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Delete\\' button, which is currently visible on the right side of the selected \\'Jeans\\' expense. The button has the text \\'Delete\\' and its bounding box is [857, 846, 877, 951]. This action is expected to delete the selected expense item. A confirmation dialog might appear, or the item might be deleted directly. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Delete\\' button successfully removed the selected duplicate \\'Jeans\\' expense item from the list. The screen updated to reflect this change, with the item and the \\'Delete\\' button disappearing. This action completed the task of deleting the identified duplicate expense, thus completing Subgoal 4.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[200,500],\"end_point\":[800,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe downwards on the screen (from [200, 500] to [800, 500]) to scroll the expense list content down, effectively moving the view to the top of the list. This is to verify the state of the expense list after the reported deletion of a duplicate item and to move away from the potentially inconsistent UI elements at the bottom of the current view. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [200,500] to [800,500] (a downward swipe on the screen) was successful. The expense list scrolled, revealing earlier dated entries (e.g., \"New Jacket Oct 5\" is now visible, whereas previously items from Oct 3 and earlier were at the top of the visible list). This means the view has moved towards the top of the overall expense list. If an item was selected and a \"Delete\" button was visible (as suggested by the first screenshot), the swipe action appears to have deselected it, as the \"Delete\" button is no longer visible in the second screenshot. This action moves the agent closer to verifying the deletion by allowing continued scrolling of the list.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[200,500],\"end_point\":[800,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe downwards on the screen (from [200, 500] to [800, 500]) to scroll the expense list content down, effectively moving the view further towards the top of the list. This is to continue the process of reaching the top of the list for verification. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [200,500] to [800,500] successfully scrolled the expense list upwards. The visible items changed from those starting with \"New Jacket 2023 Oct 5\" to those starting with \"Shirt Purchase 2023 Oct 10\". This action brings the agent closer to reaching the top of the expense list, which is a prerequisite for verifying the deletion of the duplicate item.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[200,500],\"end_point\":[800,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe downwards on the screen (from [200, 500] to [800, 500]) to scroll the expense list content down, effectively moving the view further towards the top of the list. This is to continue the process of reaching the top of the list for verification. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [200,500] to [800,500] successfully scrolled the expense list upwards. The visible items changed, with \"Snacks 2023 Oct 13\" now at the top of the visible list, whereas previously \"Shirt Purchase 2023 Oct 10\" was at the top. This action brings the agent closer to reaching the top of the expense list, which is necessary for verifying the deletion of the duplicate item.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[200,500],\"end_point\":[800,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe downwards on the screen (from [200, 500] to [800, 500]) to scroll the expense list content up, moving the view further towards the top of the list. This is to continue the process of reaching the top of the list for verification. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [200,500] to [800,500] successfully scrolled the expense list to the top. The item \"Membership Fees Today 3:00 PM\" is now visible at the top of the screen, which matches the first item in the `AllExpenseDetails` memory. This confirms that the top of the list has been reached. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by fulfilling the prerequisite of reaching the top of the list before starting the verification scroll to the bottom.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 15: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe upwards on the screen (from [800, 500] to [200, 500]) to scroll the expense list content up, effectively moving the view towards the bottom of the list.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is to verify the state of the expense list after the reported deletion of a duplicate item and to move away from the potentially inconsistent UI elements at the bottom of the current view. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [200,500] to [800,500] (a downward swipe on the screen) was successful. The expense list scrolled, revealing earlier dated entries (e.g., \"New Jacket Oct 5\" is now visible, whereas previously items from Oct 3 and earlier were at the top of the visible list). This means the view has moved towards the top of the overall expense list. If an item was selected and a \"Delete\" button was visible (as suggested by the first screenshot), the swipe action appears to have deselected it, as the \"Delete\" button is no longer visible in the second screenshot. This action moves the agent closer to verifying the deletion by allowing continued scrolling of the list.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[200,500],\"end_point\":[800,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe downwards on the screen (from [200, 500] to [800, 500]) to scroll the expense list content down, effectively moving the view further towards the top of the list. This is to continue the process of reaching the top of the list for verification. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [200,500] to [800,500] successfully scrolled the expense list upwards. The visible items changed from those starting with \"New Jacket 2023 Oct 5\" to those starting with \"Shirt Purchase 2023 Oct 10\". This action brings the agent closer to reaching the top of the expense list, which is a prerequisite for verifying the deletion of the duplicate item.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[200,500],\"end_point\":[800,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe downwards on the screen (from [200, 500] to [800, 500]) to scroll the expense list content down, effectively moving the view further towards the top of the list. This is to continue the process of reaching the top of the list for verification. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [200,500] to [800,500] successfully scrolled the expense list upwards. The visible items changed, with \"Snacks 2023 Oct 13\" now at the top of the visible list, whereas previously \"Shirt Purchase 2023 Oct 10\" was at the top. This action brings the agent closer to reaching the top of the expense list, which is necessary for verifying the deletion of the duplicate item.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[200,500],\"end_point\":[800,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe downwards on the screen (from [200, 500] to [800, 500]) to scroll the expense list content up, moving the view further towards the top of the list. This is to continue the process of reaching the top of the list for verification. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [200,500] to [800,500] successfully scrolled the expense list to the top. The item \"Membership Fees Today 3:00 PM\" is now visible at the top of the screen, which matches the first item in the `AllExpenseDetails` memory. This confirms that the top of the list has been reached. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by fulfilling the prerequisite of reaching the top of the list before starting the verification scroll to the bottom.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe upwards on the screen (from [800, 500] to [200, 500]) to scroll the expense list content up, effectively moving the view towards the bottom of the list. This is to continue the process of verifying the deletion of the duplicate item. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [800,500] to [200,500] successfully scrolled the expense list upwards, moving the view towards the bottom of the list. Before the swipe, the top of the list was visible with \"Membership Fees Today 3:00 PM\". After the swipe, items like \"Educational Software 2023 Oct 13\" are visible. This action brings the agent closer to reaching the end of the list to verify the deletion of the duplicate expense.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is to verify the state of the expense list after the reported deletion of a duplicate item and to move away from the potentially inconsistent UI elements at the bottom of the current view. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [200,500] to [800,500] (a downward swipe on the screen) was successful. The expense list scrolled, revealing earlier dated entries (e.g., \"New Jacket Oct 5\" is now visible, whereas previously items from Oct 3 and earlier were at the top of the visible list). This means the view has moved towards the top of the overall expense list. If an item was selected and a \"Delete\" button was visible (as suggested by the first screenshot), the swipe action appears to have deselected it, as the \"Delete\" button is no longer visible in the second screenshot. This action moves the agent closer to verifying the deletion by allowing continued scrolling of the list.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[200,500],\"end_point\":[800,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe downwards on the screen (from [200, 500] to [800, 500]) to scroll the expense list content down, effectively moving the view further towards the top of the list. This is to continue the process of reaching the top of the list for verification. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [200,500] to [800,500] successfully scrolled the expense list upwards. The visible items changed from those starting with \"New Jacket 2023 Oct 5\" to those starting with \"Shirt Purchase 2023 Oct 10\". This action brings the agent closer to reaching the top of the expense list, which is a prerequisite for verifying the deletion of the duplicate item.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[200,500],\"end_point\":[800,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe downwards on the screen (from [200, 500] to [800, 500]) to scroll the expense list content down, effectively moving the view further towards the top of the list. This is to continue the process of reaching the top of the list for verification. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [200,500] to [800,500] successfully scrolled the expense list upwards. The visible items changed, with \"Snacks 2023 Oct 13\" now at the top of the visible list, whereas previously \"Shirt Purchase 2023 Oct 10\" was at the top. This action brings the agent closer to reaching the top of the expense list, which is necessary for verifying the deletion of the duplicate item.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[200,500],\"end_point\":[800,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe downwards on the screen (from [200, 500] to [800, 500]) to scroll the expense list content up, moving the view further towards the top of the list. This is to continue the process of reaching the top of the list for verification. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [200,500] to [800,500] successfully scrolled the expense list to the top. The item \"Membership Fees Today 3:00 PM\" is now visible at the top of the screen, which matches the first item in the `AllExpenseDetails` memory. This confirms that the top of the list has been reached. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by fulfilling the prerequisite of reaching the top of the list before starting the verification scroll to the bottom.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe upwards on the screen (from [800, 500] to [200, 500]) to scroll the expense list content up, effectively moving the view towards the bottom of the list. This is to continue the process of verifying the deletion of the duplicate item. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [800,500] to [200,500] successfully scrolled the expense list upwards, moving the view towards the bottom of the list. Before the swipe, the top of the list was visible with \"Membership Fees Today 3:00 PM\". After the swipe, items like \"Educational Software 2023 Oct 13\" are visible. This action brings the agent closer to reaching the end of the list to verify the deletion of the duplicate expense.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 16: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe upwards on the screen (from [800, 500] to [200, 500]) to scroll the expense list content up, effectively moving the view towards the bottom of the list.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is to continue the process of reaching the top of the list for verification. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [200,500] to [800,500] successfully scrolled the expense list upwards. The visible items changed from those starting with \"New Jacket 2023 Oct 5\" to those starting with \"Shirt Purchase 2023 Oct 10\". This action brings the agent closer to reaching the top of the expense list, which is a prerequisite for verifying the deletion of the duplicate item.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[200,500],\"end_point\":[800,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe downwards on the screen (from [200, 500] to [800, 500]) to scroll the expense list content down, effectively moving the view further towards the top of the list. This is to continue the process of reaching the top of the list for verification. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [200,500] to [800,500] successfully scrolled the expense list upwards. The visible items changed, with \"Snacks 2023 Oct 13\" now at the top of the visible list, whereas previously \"Shirt Purchase 2023 Oct 10\" was at the top. This action brings the agent closer to reaching the top of the expense list, which is necessary for verifying the deletion of the duplicate item.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[200,500],\"end_point\":[800,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe downwards on the screen (from [200, 500] to [800, 500]) to scroll the expense list content up, moving the view further towards the top of the list. This is to continue the process of reaching the top of the list for verification. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [200,500] to [800,500] successfully scrolled the expense list to the top. The item \"Membership Fees Today 3:00 PM\" is now visible at the top of the screen, which matches the first item in the `AllExpenseDetails` memory. This confirms that the top of the list has been reached. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by fulfilling the prerequisite of reaching the top of the list before starting the verification scroll to the bottom.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe upwards on the screen (from [800, 500] to [200, 500]) to scroll the expense list content up, effectively moving the view towards the bottom of the list. This is to continue the process of verifying the deletion of the duplicate item. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [800,500] to [200,500] successfully scrolled the expense list upwards, moving the view towards the bottom of the list. Before the swipe, the top of the list was visible with \"Membership Fees Today 3:00 PM\". After the swipe, items like \"Educational Software 2023 Oct 13\" are visible. This action brings the agent closer to reaching the end of the list to verify the deletion of the duplicate expense.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe upwards on the screen (from [800, 500] to [200, 500]) to scroll the expense list content up, effectively moving the view towards the bottom of the list. This is to continue the process of verifying the deletion of the duplicate item. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [800,500] to [200,500] successfully scrolled the expense list upwards, moving the view towards the bottom of the list. Before the swipe, \"Educational Software 2023 Oct 13\" was visible at the top. After the swipe, \"Restaurant Meal 2023 Oct 7\" is now at the top of the visible list. This action brings the agent closer to reaching the end of the list to verify the deletion of the duplicate expense.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is to continue the process of reaching the top of the list for verification. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [200,500] to [800,500] successfully scrolled the expense list upwards. The visible items changed from those starting with \"New Jacket 2023 Oct 5\" to those starting with \"Shirt Purchase 2023 Oct 10\". This action brings the agent closer to reaching the top of the expense list, which is a prerequisite for verifying the deletion of the duplicate item.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[200,500],\"end_point\":[800,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe downwards on the screen (from [200, 500] to [800, 500]) to scroll the expense list content down, effectively moving the view further towards the top of the list. This is to continue the process of reaching the top of the list for verification. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [200,500] to [800,500] successfully scrolled the expense list upwards. The visible items changed, with \"Snacks 2023 Oct 13\" now at the top of the visible list, whereas previously \"Shirt Purchase 2023 Oct 10\" was at the top. This action brings the agent closer to reaching the top of the expense list, which is necessary for verifying the deletion of the duplicate item.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[200,500],\"end_point\":[800,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe downwards on the screen (from [200, 500] to [800, 500]) to scroll the expense list content up, moving the view further towards the top of the list. This is to continue the process of reaching the top of the list for verification. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [200,500] to [800,500] successfully scrolled the expense list to the top. The item \"Membership Fees Today 3:00 PM\" is now visible at the top of the screen, which matches the first item in the `AllExpenseDetails` memory. This confirms that the top of the list has been reached. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by fulfilling the prerequisite of reaching the top of the list before starting the verification scroll to the bottom.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe upwards on the screen (from [800, 500] to [200, 500]) to scroll the expense list content up, effectively moving the view towards the bottom of the list. This is to continue the process of verifying the deletion of the duplicate item. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [800,500] to [200,500] successfully scrolled the expense list upwards, moving the view towards the bottom of the list. Before the swipe, the top of the list was visible with \"Membership Fees Today 3:00 PM\". After the swipe, items like \"Educational Software 2023 Oct 13\" are visible. This action brings the agent closer to reaching the end of the list to verify the deletion of the duplicate expense.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe upwards on the screen (from [800, 500] to [200, 500]) to scroll the expense list content up, effectively moving the view towards the bottom of the list. This is to continue the process of verifying the deletion of the duplicate item. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [800,500] to [200,500] successfully scrolled the expense list upwards, moving the view towards the bottom of the list. Before the swipe, \"Educational Software 2023 Oct 13\" was visible at the top. After the swipe, \"Restaurant Meal 2023 Oct 7\" is now at the top of the visible list. This action brings the agent closer to reaching the end of the list to verify the deletion of the duplicate expense.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 17: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe upwards on the screen (from [800, 500] to [200, 500]) to scroll the expense list content up, effectively moving the view towards the bottom of the list.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is to continue the process of reaching the top of the list for verification. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [200,500] to [800,500] successfully scrolled the expense list upwards. The visible items changed, with \"Snacks 2023 Oct 13\" now at the top of the visible list, whereas previously \"Shirt Purchase 2023 Oct 10\" was at the top.

This is to continue the process of reaching the top of the list for verification. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [200,500] to [800,500] successfully scrolled the expense list to the top. The item \"Membership Fees Today 3:00 PM\" is now visible at the top of the screen, which matches the first item in the `AllExpenseDetails` memory. This confirms that the top of the list has been reached. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by fulfilling the prerequisite of reaching the top of the list before starting the verification scroll to the bottom.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe upwards on the screen (from [800, 500] to [200, 500]) to scroll the expense list content up, effectively moving the view towards the bottom of the list.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is to continue the process of reaching the top of the list for verification. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [200,500] to [800,500] successfully scrolled the expense list upwards. The visible items changed, with \"Snacks 2023 Oct 13\" now at the top of the visible list, whereas previously \"Shirt Purchase 2023 Oct 10\" was at the top. This action brings the agent closer to reaching the top of the expense list, which is necessary for verifying the deletion of the duplicate item.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[200,500],\"end_point\":[800,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe downwards on the screen (from [200, 500] to [800, 500]) to scroll the expense list content up, moving the view further towards the top of the list. This is to continue the process of reaching the top of the list for verification. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [200,500] to [800,500] successfully scrolled the expense list to the top. The item \"Membership Fees Today 3:00 PM\" is now visible at the top of the screen, which matches the first item in the `AllExpenseDetails` memory. This confirms that the top of the list has been reached. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by fulfilling the prerequisite of reaching the top of the list before starting the verification scroll to the bottom.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe upwards on the screen (from [800, 500] to [200, 500]) to scroll the expense list content up, effectively moving the view towards the bottom of the list. This is to continue the process of verifying the deletion of the duplicate item. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [800,500] to [200,500] successfully scrolled the expense list upwards, moving the view towards the bottom of the list. Before the swipe, the top of the list was visible with \"Membership Fees Today 3:00 PM\". After the swipe, items like \"Educational Software 2023 Oct 13\" are visible. This action brings the agent closer to reaching the end of the list to verify the deletion of the duplicate expense.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe upwards on the screen (from [800, 500] to [200, 500]) to scroll the expense list content up, effectively moving the view towards the bottom of the list. This is to continue the process of verifying the deletion of the duplicate item. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [800,500] to [200,500] successfully scrolled the expense list upwards, moving the view towards the bottom of the list. Before the swipe, \"Educational Software 2023 Oct 13\" was visible at the top. After the swipe, \"Restaurant Meal 2023 Oct 7\" is now at the top of the visible list. This action brings the agent closer to reaching the end of the list to verify the deletion of the duplicate expense.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe upwards on the screen (from [800, 500] to [200, 500]) to scroll the expense list content up, effectively moving the view towards the bottom of the list. This is to continue the process of verifying the deletion of the duplicate item. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [800,500] to [200,500] successfully scrolled the expense list upwards, moving the view towards the bottom of the list. Before the swipe, \"Restaurant Meal 2023 Oct 7\" was at the top of the visible list. After the swipe, \"Laundry 2023 Oct 5\" is now at the top of the visible list. This action brings the agent closer to reaching the end of the list to verify the deletion of the duplicate expense.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 18: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe upwards on the screen (from [800, 500] to [200, 500]) to scroll the expense list content up, effectively moving the view towards the bottom of the list.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is to continue the process of reaching the top of the list for verification. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [200,500] to [800,500] successfully scrolled the expense list to the top. The item \"Membership Fees Today 3:00 PM\" is now visible at the top of the screen, which matches the first item in the `AllExpenseDetails` memory.

This is to continue the process of verifying the deletion of the duplicate item. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [800,500] to [200,500] successfully scrolled the expense list upwards, moving the view towards the bottom of the list. Before the swipe, the top of the list was visible with \"Membership Fees Today 3:00 PM\". After the swipe, items like \"Educational Software 2023 Oct 13\" are visible. This action brings the agent closer to reaching the end of the list to verify the deletion of the duplicate expense.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe upwards on the screen (from [800, 500] to [200, 500]) to scroll the expense list content up, effectively moving the view towards the bottom of the list. This is to continue the process of verifying the deletion of the duplicate item. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [800,500] to [200,500] successfully scrolled the expense list upwards, moving the view towards the bottom of the list. Before the swipe, \"Educational Software 2023 Oct 13\" was visible at the top. After the swipe, \"Restaurant Meal 2023 Oct 7\" is now at the top of the visible list.

Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [800,500] to [200,500] successfully scrolled the expense list upwards. \"Freelance Payment 2023 Oct 3\" is now at the top of the visible list, whereas \"Laundry 2023 Oct 5\" was at the top before. The item \"Jeans 2023 Oct 1 496.36 $\" is now visible at the bottom of the screen, indicating that the end of the list is likely reached. A \"Delete\" button is also visible next to this \"Jeans\" item, which is unexpected after a swipe. This action brought the agent closer to verifying the list by reaching its end.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is to continue the process of reaching the top of the list for verification. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [200,500] to [800,500] successfully scrolled the expense list to the top. The item \"Membership Fees Today 3:00 PM\" is now visible at the top of the screen, which matches the first item in the `AllExpenseDetails` memory. This confirms that the top of the list has been reached. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by fulfilling the prerequisite of reaching the top of the list before starting the verification scroll to the bottom.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe upwards on the screen (from [800, 500] to [200, 500]) to scroll the expense list content up, effectively moving the view towards the bottom of the list. This is to continue the process of verifying the deletion of the duplicate item. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [800,500] to [200,500] successfully scrolled the expense list upwards, moving the view towards the bottom of the list. Before the swipe, the top of the list was visible with \"Membership Fees Today 3:00 PM\". After the swipe, items like \"Educational Software 2023 Oct 13\" are visible. This action brings the agent closer to reaching the end of the list to verify the deletion of the duplicate expense.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe upwards on the screen (from [800, 500] to [200, 500]) to scroll the expense list content up, effectively moving the view towards the bottom of the list. This is to continue the process of verifying the deletion of the duplicate item. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [800,500] to [200,500] successfully scrolled the expense list upwards, moving the view towards the bottom of the list. Before the swipe, \"Educational Software 2023 Oct 13\" was visible at the top. After the swipe, \"Restaurant Meal 2023 Oct 7\" is now at the top of the visible list. This action brings the agent closer to reaching the end of the list to verify the deletion of the duplicate expense.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe upwards on the screen (from [800, 500] to [200, 500]) to scroll the expense list content up, effectively moving the view towards the bottom of the list. This is to continue the process of verifying the deletion of the duplicate item. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [800,500] to [200,500] successfully scrolled the expense list upwards, moving the view towards the bottom of the list. Before the swipe, \"Restaurant Meal 2023 Oct 7\" was at the top of the visible list. After the swipe, \"Laundry 2023 Oct 5\" is now at the top of the visible list. This action brings the agent closer to reaching the end of the list to verify the deletion of the duplicate expense.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe upwards on the screen (from [800, 500] to [200, 500]) to scroll the expense list content up, effectively moving the view towards the bottom of the list. This is to continue the process of verifying the deletion of the duplicate item. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [800,500] to [200,500] successfully scrolled the expense list upwards. \"Freelance Payment 2023 Oct 3\" is now at the top of the visible list, whereas \"Laundry 2023 Oct 5\" was at the top before. The item \"Jeans 2023 Oct 1 496.36 $\" is now visible at the bottom of the screen, indicating that the end of the list is likely reached. A \"Delete\" button is also visible next to this \"Jeans\" item, which is unexpected after a swipe. This action brought the agent closer to verifying the list by reaching its end. The \"Delete\" button will be disregarded for the verification step.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 19: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe upwards on the screen (from [800, 500] to [200, 500]) to attempt to scroll the expense list further down. This action is to confirm if the current view is at the absolute bottom of the list. The \\'Jeans 2023 Oct 1\\' item is currently at the bottom with a \\'Delete\\' button visible.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",
