To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is predicted to reveal the app drawer, where I can then search for the \\'pro expense\\' app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'pro expense\\' app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [900, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down the app drawer. This action is predicted to reveal more apps in the list, hopefully including the \\'pro expense\\' app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, and the \\'Pro Expense\\' app is now visible on the screen. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'pro expense\\' app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[648,395],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon, which is a blue square with a white border and a white inner square, located at approximately [648, 395]. This action is predicted to open the \\'Pro Expense\\' app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon was successful. The \\'Pro Expense\\' app opened, and its main screen is now displayed. This brings the agent closer to the overall user instruction by completing the first subgoal. The screen now shows a list of recent expenses, including those that need to be deleted.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 3: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[829,366],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense item, which is currently visible and displays \\'Ride-Sharing\\' and \\'2023 Oct 6\\'. The item is located around the coordinates [829, 366]. This action is predicted to reveal a context menu or options related to the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense, hopefully including a delete option.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16.

This action is predicted to reveal the app drawer, where I can then search for the \\'pro expense\\' app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'pro expense\\' app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [900, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down the app drawer. This action is predicted to reveal more apps in the list, hopefully including the \\'pro expense\\' app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, and the \\'Pro Expense\\' app is now visible on the screen. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'pro expense\\' app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[648,395],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon, which is a blue square with a white border and a white inner square, located at approximately [648, 395]. This action is predicted to open the \\'Pro Expense\\' app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon was successful. The \\'Pro Expense\\' app opened, and its main screen is now displayed. This brings the agent closer to the overall user instruction by completing the first subgoal. The screen now shows a list of recent expenses, including those that need to be deleted.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[829,366],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense item, which is currently visible and displays \\'Ride-Sharing\\' and \\'2023 Oct 6\\'. The item is located around the coordinates [829, 366]. This action is predicted to reveal a context menu or options related to the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense, hopefully including a delete option. Actual Outcome: The long press on the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense item successfully navigated the app to the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for that specific expense. This screen displays the details of the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense and, importantly, shows a trash can icon in the upper right area of the detail card, which is the likely control for deleting the expense. An \\'EDIT\\' button is also present at the bottom of the screen. The action brought the agent closer to deleting the expense.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.35\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [75, 173, 96, 314], \\'text\\': \\'Home\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [145, 54, 165, 183], \\'text\\': \\'Totals\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [174, 55, 192, 256], \\'text\\': \\'OCT 15 22\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [220, 97, 231, 214], \\'text\\': \\'INCOME\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [238, 92, 262, 201], \\'text\\': \\'OusD\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [289, 97, 301, 242], \\'text\\': \\'OUTCOME\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [307, 92, 331, 201], \\'text\\': \\'OusD\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [403, 53, 451, 500], \\'text\\': \\'Expenses in this Week OCT 15 22\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [602, 36, 629, 378], \\'text\\': \\'Expense Detail\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [679, 244, 710, 548], \\'text\\': \\'Ride-Sharing\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [746, 76, 761, 205], \\'text\\': \\'Amount\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [743, 247, 761, 440], \\'text\\': \\'290.41usD\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [792, 75, 807, 154], \\'text\\': \\'Date\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [790, 248, 807, 454], \\'text\\': \\'2023 Oct 6\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [834, 77, 848, 156], \\'text\\': \\'Note\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [830, 249, 850, 492], \\'text\\': \\'Want to have\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [918, 496, 934, 582], \\'text\\': \\'EDIT\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [902, 34, 952, 969]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 38, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 820, 37, 899]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below.

This action is predicted to reveal the app drawer, where I can then search for the \\'pro expense\\' app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'pro expense\\' app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [900, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down the app drawer. This action is predicted to reveal more apps in the list, hopefully including the \\'pro expense\\' app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, and the \\'Pro Expense\\' app is now visible on the screen. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'pro expense\\' app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[648,395],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon, which is a blue square with a white border and a white inner square, located at approximately [648, 395]. This action is predicted to open the \\'Pro Expense\\' app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon was successful. The \\'Pro Expense\\' app opened, and its main screen is now displayed. This brings the agent closer to the overall user instruction by completing the first subgoal. The screen now shows a list of recent expenses, including those that need to be deleted.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[829,366],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense item, which is currently visible and displays \\'Ride-Sharing\\' and \\'2023 Oct 6\\'. The item is located around the coordinates [829, 366]. This action is predicted to reveal a context menu or options related to the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense, hopefully including a delete option. Actual Outcome: The long press on the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense item successfully navigated the app to the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for that specific expense. This screen displays the details of the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense and, importantly, shows a trash can icon in the upper right area of the detail card, which is the likely control for deleting the expense. An \\'EDIT\\' button is also present at the bottom of the screen. The action brought the agent closer to deleting the expense.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 4: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[690,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the trash can icon, visually estimated to be at [690, 900], to delete the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense. The icon is currently visible on the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open \\'pro expense\\' app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'pro expense\\' app is open and its main screen is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully opened the app drawer, scrolled to find the \\'Pro Expense\\' app, and tapped on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is predicted to reveal the app drawer, where I can then search for the \\'pro expense\\' app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'pro expense\\' app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [900, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down the app drawer. This action is predicted to reveal more apps in the list, hopefully including the \\'pro expense\\' app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, and the \\'Pro Expense\\' app is now visible on the screen. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'pro expense\\' app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[648,395],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon, which is a blue square with a white border and a white inner square, located at approximately [648, 395]. This action is predicted to open the \\'Pro Expense\\' app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon was successful. The \\'Pro Expense\\' app opened, and its main screen is now displayed. This brings the agent closer to the overall user instruction by completing the first subgoal. The screen now shows a list of recent expenses, including those that need to be deleted.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[829,366],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense item, which is currently visible and displays \\'Ride-Sharing\\' and \\'2023 Oct 6\\'. The item is located around the coordinates [829, 366]. This action is predicted to reveal a context menu or options related to the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense, hopefully including a delete option. Actual Outcome: The long press on the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense item successfully navigated the app to the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for that specific expense. This screen displays the details of the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense and, importantly, shows a trash can icon in the upper right area of the detail card, which is the likely control for deleting the expense. An \\'EDIT\\' button is also present at the bottom of the screen. The action brought the agent closer to deleting the expense.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[690,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the trash can icon, visually estimated to be at [690, 900], to delete the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense. The icon is currently visible on the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the trash can icon at [690, 900] did not result in any visible change on the screen. The \\'Expense Detail\\' page for \\'Ride-Sharing\\' remains displayed, and the trash can icon is still present. The action did not bring the agent closer to deleting the expense. The failure might be due to the tap not registering or the icon requiring a different interaction.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 44, 35, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.36\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [75, 173, 96, 314], \\'text\\': \\'Home\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [145, 54, 165, 183], \\'text\\': \\'Totals\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [174, 55, 192, 256], \\'text\\': \\'OCT 15 22\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [220, 97, 231, 214], \\'text\\': \\'INCOME\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [238, 92, 262, 201], \\'text\\': \\'OusD\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [289, 97, 301, 242], \\'text\\': \\'OUTCOME\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [307, 92, 331, 201], \\'text\\': \\'OusD\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [403, 53, 451, 500], \\'text\\': \\'Expenses in this Week OCT 15 22\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [602, 36, 629, 378], \\'text\\': \\'Expense Detail\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [679, 244, 710, 548], \\'text\\': \\'Ride-Sharing\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [746, 76, 761, 205], \\'text\\': \\'Amount\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [743, 247, 761, 440], \\'text\\': \\'290.41usD\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [792, 75, 807, 154], \\'text\\': \\'Date\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [790, 248, 807, 454], \\'text\\': \\'2023 Oct 6\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [834, 77, 848, 156], \\'text\\': \\'Note\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [830, 249, 850, 492], \\'text\\': \\'Want to have\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [918, 496, 934, 582], \\'text\\': \\'EDIT\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [902, 34, 952, 970]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 38, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 820, 37, 899]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 49, 37, 189]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is predicted to reveal the app drawer, where I can then search for the \\'pro expense\\' app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'pro expense\\' app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [900, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down the app drawer. This action is predicted to reveal more apps in the list, hopefully including the \\'pro expense\\' app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, and the \\'Pro Expense\\' app is now visible on the screen. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'pro expense\\' app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[648,395],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon, which is a blue square with a white border and a white inner square, located at approximately [648, 395]. This action is predicted to open the \\'Pro Expense\\' app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon was successful. The \\'Pro Expense\\' app opened, and its main screen is now displayed. This brings the agent closer to the overall user instruction by completing the first subgoal. The screen now shows a list of recent expenses, including those that need to be deleted.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[829,366],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense item, which is currently visible and displays \\'Ride-Sharing\\' and \\'2023 Oct 6\\'. The item is located around the coordinates [829, 366]. This action is predicted to reveal a context menu or options related to the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense, hopefully including a delete option. Actual Outcome: The long press on the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense item successfully navigated the app to the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for that specific expense. This screen displays the details of the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense and, importantly, shows a trash can icon in the upper right area of the detail card, which is the likely control for deleting the expense. An \\'EDIT\\' button is also present at the bottom of the screen. The action brought the agent closer to deleting the expense.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[690,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the trash can icon, visually estimated to be at [690, 900], to delete the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense. The icon is currently visible on the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the trash can icon at [690, 900] did not result in any visible change on the screen. The \\'Expense Detail\\' page for \\'Ride-Sharing\\' remains displayed, and the trash can icon is still present. The action did not bring the agent closer to deleting the expense. The failure might be due to the tap not registering or the icon requiring a different interaction.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 5: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[695,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the trash can icon, estimated to be at [695, 900], to delete the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense. The icon is currently visible on the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen. This action is predicted to initiate the deletion process, possibly by showing a confirmation dialog. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open \\'pro expense\\' app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'pro expense\\' app is open and its main screen is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully opened the app drawer, scrolled to find the \\'Pro Expense\\' app, and tapped on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is predicted to reveal more apps in the list, hopefully including the \\'pro expense\\' app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, and the \\'Pro Expense\\' app is now visible on the screen. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'pro expense\\' app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[648,395],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon, which is a blue square with a white border and a white inner square, located at approximately [648, 395]. This action is predicted to open the \\'Pro Expense\\' app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon was successful. The \\'Pro Expense\\' app opened, and its main screen is now displayed. This brings the agent closer to the overall user instruction by completing the first subgoal. The screen now shows a list of recent expenses, including those that need to be deleted.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[829,366],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense item, which is currently visible and displays \\'Ride-Sharing\\' and \\'2023 Oct 6\\'. The item is located around the coordinates [829, 366]. This action is predicted to reveal a context menu or options related to the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense, hopefully including a delete option. Actual Outcome: The long press on the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense item successfully navigated the app to the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for that specific expense. This screen displays the details of the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense and, importantly, shows a trash can icon in the upper right area of the detail card, which is the likely control for deleting the expense. An \\'EDIT\\' button is also present at the bottom of the screen. The action brought the agent closer to deleting the expense.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[690,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the trash can icon, visually estimated to be at [690, 900], to delete the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense. The icon is currently visible on the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the trash can icon at [690, 900] did not result in any visible change on the screen. The \\'Expense Detail\\' page for \\'Ride-Sharing\\' remains displayed, and the trash can icon is still present. The action did not bring the agent closer to deleting the expense. The failure might be due to the tap not registering or the icon requiring a different interaction.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[695,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the trash can icon, estimated to be at [695, 900], to delete the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense. The icon is currently visible on the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen. This action is predicted to initiate the deletion process, possibly by showing a confirmation dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the trash can icon at [695, 900] was successful. It triggered a confirmation dialog at the bottom of the screen stating \\'item will be deleted!\\' with a \\'CONFIRM\\' button. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of deleting the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nDelete the following expenses from pro expense: Ride-Sharing, Flight Tickets, Taxi Fare.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [900, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down the app drawer. This action is predicted to reveal more apps in the list, hopefully including the \\'pro expense\\' app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, and the \\'Pro Expense\\' app is now visible on the screen. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'pro expense\\' app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[648,395],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon, which is a blue square with a white border and a white inner square, located at approximately [648, 395]. This action is predicted to open the \\'Pro Expense\\' app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon was successful. The \\'Pro Expense\\' app opened, and its main screen is now displayed. This brings the agent closer to the overall user instruction by completing the first subgoal. The screen now shows a list of recent expenses, including those that need to be deleted.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[829,366],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense item, which is currently visible and displays \\'Ride-Sharing\\' and \\'2023 Oct 6\\'. The item is located around the coordinates [829, 366]. This action is predicted to reveal a context menu or options related to the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense, hopefully including a delete option. Actual Outcome: The long press on the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense item successfully navigated the app to the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for that specific expense. This screen displays the details of the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense and, importantly, shows a trash can icon in the upper right area of the detail card, which is the likely control for deleting the expense. An \\'EDIT\\' button is also present at the bottom of the screen. The action brought the agent closer to deleting the expense.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[690,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the trash can icon, visually estimated to be at [690, 900], to delete the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense. The icon is currently visible on the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the trash can icon at [690, 900] did not result in any visible change on the screen. The \\'Expense Detail\\' page for \\'Ride-Sharing\\' remains displayed, and the trash can icon is still present. The action did not bring the agent closer to deleting the expense. The failure might be due to the tap not registering or the icon requiring a different interaction.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[695,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the trash can icon, estimated to be at [695, 900], to delete the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense. The icon is currently visible on the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen. This action is predicted to initiate the deletion process, possibly by showing a confirmation dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the trash can icon at [695, 900] was successful. It triggered a confirmation dialog at the bottom of the screen stating \\'item will be deleted!\\' with a \\'CONFIRM\\' button. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of deleting the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 6: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[926,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'CONFIRM\\' button, located at approximately [926, 500], to confirm the deletion of the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense. This action is predicted to delete the expense and return to the previous screen or update the current screen to reflect the deletion. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open \\'pro expense\\' app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'pro expense\\' app is open and its main screen is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully opened the app drawer, scrolled to find the \\'Pro Expense\\' app, and tapped on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"},{\"VariableName\":\"Taxi Fare_DeletionStatus\",\"Content\":\"\",\"Status\":\"This piece of information is sought. No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[648,395],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon, which is a blue square with a white border and a white inner square, located at approximately [648, 395]. This action is predicted to open the \\'Pro Expense\\' app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon was successful. The \\'Pro Expense\\' app opened, and its main screen is now displayed. This brings the agent closer to the overall user instruction by completing the first subgoal. The screen now shows a list of recent expenses, including those that need to be deleted.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[829,366],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense item, which is currently visible and displays \\'Ride-Sharing\\' and \\'2023 Oct 6\\'. The item is located around the coordinates [829, 366]. This action is predicted to reveal a context menu or options related to the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense, hopefully including a delete option. Actual Outcome: The long press on the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense item successfully navigated the app to the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for that specific expense. This screen displays the details of the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense and, importantly, shows a trash can icon in the upper right area of the detail card, which is the likely control for deleting the expense. An \\'EDIT\\' button is also present at the bottom of the screen. The action brought the agent closer to deleting the expense.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[690,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the trash can icon, visually estimated to be at [690, 900], to delete the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense. The icon is currently visible on the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the trash can icon at [690, 900] did not result in any visible change on the screen. The \\'Expense Detail\\' page for \\'Ride-Sharing\\' remains displayed, and the trash can icon is still present. The action did not bring the agent closer to deleting the expense. The failure might be due to the tap not registering or the icon requiring a different interaction.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[695,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the trash can icon, estimated to be at [695, 900], to delete the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense. The icon is currently visible on the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen. This action is predicted to initiate the deletion process, possibly by showing a confirmation dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the trash can icon at [695, 900] was successful. It triggered a confirmation dialog at the bottom of the screen stating \\'item will be deleted!\\' with a \\'CONFIRM\\' button. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of deleting the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[926,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'CONFIRM\\' button, located at approximately [926, 500], to confirm the deletion of the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense. This action is predicted to delete the expense and return to the previous screen or update the current screen to reflect the deletion. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'CONFIRM\\' button successfully deleted the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense. The confirmation dialog closed, and the app returned to the main \\'Home\\' screen. The \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense is no longer visible in the \\'Recent\\' list, indicating the deletion was successful. This action completed the active subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[648,395],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon, which is a blue square with a white border and a white inner square, located at approximately [648, 395]. This action is predicted to open the \\'Pro Expense\\' app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon was successful. The \\'Pro Expense\\' app opened, and its main screen is now displayed. This brings the agent closer to the overall user instruction by completing the first subgoal. The screen now shows a list of recent expenses, including those that need to be deleted.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[829,366],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense item, which is currently visible and displays \\'Ride-Sharing\\' and \\'2023 Oct 6\\'. The item is located around the coordinates [829, 366]. This action is predicted to reveal a context menu or options related to the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense, hopefully including a delete option. Actual Outcome: The long press on the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense item successfully navigated the app to the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for that specific expense. This screen displays the details of the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense and, importantly, shows a trash can icon in the upper right area of the detail card, which is the likely control for deleting the expense. An \\'EDIT\\' button is also present at the bottom of the screen. The action brought the agent closer to deleting the expense.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[690,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the trash can icon, visually estimated to be at [690, 900], to delete the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense. The icon is currently visible on the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the trash can icon at [690, 900] did not result in any visible change on the screen. The \\'Expense Detail\\' page for \\'Ride-Sharing\\' remains displayed, and the trash can icon is still present. The action did not bring the agent closer to deleting the expense. The failure might be due to the tap not registering or the icon requiring a different interaction.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[695,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the trash can icon, estimated to be at [695, 900], to delete the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense. The icon is currently visible on the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen. This action is predicted to initiate the deletion process, possibly by showing a confirmation dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the trash can icon at [695, 900] was successful. It triggered a confirmation dialog at the bottom of the screen stating \\'item will be deleted!\\' with a \\'CONFIRM\\' button. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of deleting the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[926,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'CONFIRM\\' button, located at approximately [926, 500], to confirm the deletion of the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense. This action is predicted to delete the expense and return to the previous screen or update the current screen to reflect the deletion. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'CONFIRM\\' button successfully deleted the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense. The confirmation dialog closed, and the app returned to the main \\'Home\\' screen. The \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense is no longer visible in the \\'Recent\\' list, indicating the deletion was successful. This action completed the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 7: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[830,374],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense item, which is visible in the \\'Recent\\' list and displays \\'Flight Tickets 2023 Oct 6\\'. The item is located around coordinates [830, 374]. This action is predicted to open the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for \\'Flight Tickets\\', where the delete option should be available. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open \\'pro expense\\' app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'pro expense\\' app is open and its main screen is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully opened the app drawer, scrolled to find the \\'Pro Expense\\' app, and tapped on the \\'Pro Expense\\' app icon.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[829,366],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense item, which is currently visible and displays \\'Ride-Sharing\\' and \\'2023 Oct 6\\'. The item is located around the coordinates [829, 366]. This action is predicted to reveal a context menu or options related to the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense, hopefully including a delete option. Actual Outcome: The long press on the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense item successfully navigated the app to the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for that specific expense. This screen displays the details of the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense and, importantly, shows a trash can icon in the upper right area of the detail card, which is the likely control for deleting the expense. An \\'EDIT\\' button is also present at the bottom of the screen. The action brought the agent closer to deleting the expense.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[690,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the trash can icon, visually estimated to be at [690, 900], to delete the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense. The icon is currently visible on the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the trash can icon at [690, 900] did not result in any visible change on the screen. The \\'Expense Detail\\' page for \\'Ride-Sharing\\' remains displayed, and the trash can icon is still present. The action did not bring the agent closer to deleting the expense. The failure might be due to the tap not registering or the icon requiring a different interaction.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[695,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the trash can icon, estimated to be at [695, 900], to delete the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense. The icon is currently visible on the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen. This action is predicted to initiate the deletion process, possibly by showing a confirmation dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the trash can icon at [695, 900] was successful. It triggered a confirmation dialog at the bottom of the screen stating \\'item will be deleted!\\' with a \\'CONFIRM\\' button. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of deleting the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[926,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'CONFIRM\\' button, located at approximately [926, 500], to confirm the deletion of the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense. This action is predicted to delete the expense and return to the previous screen or update the current screen to reflect the deletion. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'CONFIRM\\' button successfully deleted the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense. The confirmation dialog closed, and the app returned to the main \\'Home\\' screen. The \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense is no longer visible in the \\'Recent\\' list, indicating the deletion was successful. This action completed the active subgoal.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[830,374],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense item, which is visible in the \\'Recent\\' list and displays \\'Flight Tickets 2023 Oct 6\\'. The item is located around coordinates [830, 374]. This action is predicted to open the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for \\'Flight Tickets\\', where the delete option should be available. Actual Outcome: The long press on the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense item at [830, 374] was successful. The app navigated from the main \\'Home\\' screen to the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for \\'Flight Tickets\\'. This screen displays the details of the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense (Amount: 97.91 USD, Date: 2023 Oct 6, Note: Urgent) and, crucially, a trash can icon in the upper right of the detail card and an \\'EDIT\\' button at the bottom. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of deleting the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense by making the delete option accessible.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.38\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [75, 173, 96, 314], \\'text\\': \\'Home\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [145, 54, 165, 183], \\'text\\': \\'Totals\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [174, 55, 192, 256], \\'text\\': \\'OCT 15 22\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [220, 97, 231, 214], \\'text\\': \\'INCOME\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [238, 92, 262, 201], \\'text\\': \\'OusD\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [289, 97, 301, 242], \\'text\\': \\'OUTCOME\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [307, 92, 331, 201], \\'text\\': \\'OusD\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [403, 53, 451, 500], \\'text\\': \\'Expenses in this Week OCT 15 22\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [602, 36, 629, 378], \\'text\\': \\'Expense Detail\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [680, 244, 709, 564], \\'text\\': \\'Flight Tickets\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [746, 76, 761, 205], \\'text\\': \\'Amount\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [743, 247, 761, 414], \\'text\\': \\'97.91usD\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [792, 75, 807, 154], \\'text\\': \\'Date\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [790, 248, 807, 454], \\'text\\': \\'2023 Oct 6\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [833, 75, 850, 157], \\'text\\': \\'Note\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [831, 246, 852, 377], \\'text\\': \\'Urgent\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [918, 496, 934, 582], \\'text\\': \\'EDIT\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [902, 34, 952, 970]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 38, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 820, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 906, 36, 942]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 54, 37, 189]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[829,366],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense item, which is currently visible and displays \\'Ride-Sharing\\' and \\'2023 Oct 6\\'. The item is located around the coordinates [829, 366]. This action is predicted to reveal a context menu or options related to the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense, hopefully including a delete option. Actual Outcome: The long press on the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense item successfully navigated the app to the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for that specific expense. This screen displays the details of the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense and, importantly, shows a trash can icon in the upper right area of the detail card, which is the likely control for deleting the expense. An \\'EDIT\\' button is also present at the bottom of the screen. The action brought the agent closer to deleting the expense.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[690,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the trash can icon, visually estimated to be at [690, 900], to delete the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense. The icon is currently visible on the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the trash can icon at [690, 900] did not result in any visible change on the screen. The \\'Expense Detail\\' page for \\'Ride-Sharing\\' remains displayed, and the trash can icon is still present. The action did not bring the agent closer to deleting the expense. The failure might be due to the tap not registering or the icon requiring a different interaction.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[695,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the trash can icon, estimated to be at [695, 900], to delete the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense. The icon is currently visible on the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen. This action is predicted to initiate the deletion process, possibly by showing a confirmation dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the trash can icon at [695, 900] was successful. It triggered a confirmation dialog at the bottom of the screen stating \\'item will be deleted!\\' with a \\'CONFIRM\\' button. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of deleting the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[926,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'CONFIRM\\' button, located at approximately [926, 500], to confirm the deletion of the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense. This action is predicted to delete the expense and return to the previous screen or update the current screen to reflect the deletion. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'CONFIRM\\' button successfully deleted the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense. The confirmation dialog closed, and the app returned to the main \\'Home\\' screen. The \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense is no longer visible in the \\'Recent\\' list, indicating the deletion was successful. This action completed the active subgoal.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[830,374],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense item, which is visible in the \\'Recent\\' list and displays \\'Flight Tickets 2023 Oct 6\\'. The item is located around coordinates [830, 374]. This action is predicted to open the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for \\'Flight Tickets\\', where the delete option should be available. Actual Outcome: The long press on the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense item at [830, 374] was successful. The app navigated from the main \\'Home\\' screen to the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for \\'Flight Tickets\\'. This screen displays the details of the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense (Amount: 97.91 USD, Date: 2023 Oct 6, Note: Urgent) and, crucially, a trash can icon in the upper right of the detail card and an \\'EDIT\\' button at the bottom. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of deleting the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense by making the delete option accessible.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 8: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[695,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the trash can icon, estimated to be at [695, 900], on the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for \\'Flight Tickets\\'. This action is predicted to trigger a confirmation dialog for deleting the expense.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[690,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the trash can icon, visually estimated to be at [690, 900], to delete the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense. The icon is currently visible on the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the trash can icon at [690, 900] did not result in any visible change on the screen. The \\'Expense Detail\\' page for \\'Ride-Sharing\\' remains displayed, and the trash can icon is still present. The action did not bring the agent closer to deleting the expense. The failure might be due to the tap not registering or the icon requiring a different interaction.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[695,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the trash can icon, estimated to be at [695, 900], to delete the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense. The icon is currently visible on the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen. This action is predicted to initiate the deletion process, possibly by showing a confirmation dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the trash can icon at [695, 900] was successful. It triggered a confirmation dialog at the bottom of the screen stating \\'item will be deleted!\\' with a \\'CONFIRM\\' button. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of deleting the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[926,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'CONFIRM\\' button, located at approximately [926, 500], to confirm the deletion of the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense. This action is predicted to delete the expense and return to the previous screen or update the current screen to reflect the deletion. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'CONFIRM\\' button successfully deleted the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense. The confirmation dialog closed, and the app returned to the main \\'Home\\' screen. The \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense is no longer visible in the \\'Recent\\' list, indicating the deletion was successful. This action completed the active subgoal.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[830,374],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense item, which is visible in the \\'Recent\\' list and displays \\'Flight Tickets 2023 Oct 6\\'. The item is located around coordinates [830, 374]. This action is predicted to open the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for \\'Flight Tickets\\', where the delete option should be available. Actual Outcome: The long press on the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense item at [830, 374] was successful. The app navigated from the main \\'Home\\' screen to the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for \\'Flight Tickets\\'. This screen displays the details of the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense (Amount: 97.91 USD, Date: 2023 Oct 6, Note: Urgent) and, crucially, a trash can icon in the upper right of the detail card and an \\'EDIT\\' button at the bottom. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of deleting the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense by making the delete option accessible.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[695,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the trash can icon, estimated to be at [695, 900], on the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for \\'Flight Tickets\\'. This action is predicted to trigger a confirmation dialog for deleting the expense. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the trash can icon (estimated at [695, 900]) on the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for \\'Flight Tickets\\' was successful. It triggered a confirmation dialog at the bottom of the screen stating \\'item will be deleted!\\' with a \\'CONFIRM\\' button. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of deleting the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[690,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the trash can icon, visually estimated to be at [690, 900], to delete the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense. The icon is currently visible on the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the trash can icon at [690, 900] did not result in any visible change on the screen. The \\'Expense Detail\\' page for \\'Ride-Sharing\\' remains displayed, and the trash can icon is still present. The action did not bring the agent closer to deleting the expense. The failure might be due to the tap not registering or the icon requiring a different interaction.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[695,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the trash can icon, estimated to be at [695, 900], to delete the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense. The icon is currently visible on the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen. This action is predicted to initiate the deletion process, possibly by showing a confirmation dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the trash can icon at [695, 900] was successful. It triggered a confirmation dialog at the bottom of the screen stating \\'item will be deleted!\\' with a \\'CONFIRM\\' button. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of deleting the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[926,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'CONFIRM\\' button, located at approximately [926, 500], to confirm the deletion of the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense. This action is predicted to delete the expense and return to the previous screen or update the current screen to reflect the deletion. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'CONFIRM\\' button successfully deleted the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense. The confirmation dialog closed, and the app returned to the main \\'Home\\' screen. The \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense is no longer visible in the \\'Recent\\' list, indicating the deletion was successful. This action completed the active subgoal.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[830,374],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense item, which is visible in the \\'Recent\\' list and displays \\'Flight Tickets 2023 Oct 6\\'. The item is located around coordinates [830, 374]. This action is predicted to open the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for \\'Flight Tickets\\', where the delete option should be available. Actual Outcome: The long press on the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense item at [830, 374] was successful. The app navigated from the main \\'Home\\' screen to the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for \\'Flight Tickets\\'. This screen displays the details of the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense (Amount: 97.91 USD, Date: 2023 Oct 6, Note: Urgent) and, crucially, a trash can icon in the upper right of the detail card and an \\'EDIT\\' button at the bottom. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of deleting the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense by making the delete option accessible.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[695,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the trash can icon, estimated to be at [695, 900], on the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for \\'Flight Tickets\\'. This action is predicted to trigger a confirmation dialog for deleting the expense. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the trash can icon (estimated at [695, 900]) on the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for \\'Flight Tickets\\' was successful. It triggered a confirmation dialog at the bottom of the screen stating \\'item will be deleted!\\' with a \\'CONFIRM\\' button. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of deleting the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 9: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[695,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the trash can icon, estimated to be at [695, 900], to delete the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense. The icon is currently visible on the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen. This action is predicted to initiate the deletion process, possibly by showing a confirmation dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the trash can icon at [695, 900] was successful. It triggered a confirmation dialog at the bottom of the screen stating \\'item will be deleted!\\' with a \\'CONFIRM\\' button. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of deleting the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[926,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'CONFIRM\\' button, located at approximately [926, 500], to confirm the deletion of the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense. This action is predicted to delete the expense and return to the previous screen or update the current screen to reflect the deletion. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'CONFIRM\\' button successfully deleted the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense. The confirmation dialog closed, and the app returned to the main \\'Home\\' screen. The \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense is no longer visible in the \\'Recent\\' list, indicating the deletion was successful. This action completed the active subgoal.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[830,374],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense item, which is visible in the \\'Recent\\' list and displays \\'Flight Tickets 2023 Oct 6\\'. The item is located around coordinates [830, 374]. This action is predicted to open the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for \\'Flight Tickets\\', where the delete option should be available. Actual Outcome: The long press on the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense item at [830, 374] was successful. The app navigated from the main \\'Home\\' screen to the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for \\'Flight Tickets\\'. This screen displays the details of the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense (Amount: 97.91 USD, Date: 2023 Oct 6, Note: Urgent) and, crucially, a trash can icon in the upper right of the detail card and an \\'EDIT\\' button at the bottom. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of deleting the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense by making the delete option accessible.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[695,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the trash can icon, estimated to be at [695, 900], on the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for \\'Flight Tickets\\'. This action is predicted to trigger a confirmation dialog for deleting the expense. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the trash can icon (estimated at [695, 900]) on the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for \\'Flight Tickets\\' was successful. It triggered a confirmation dialog at the bottom of the screen stating \\'item will be deleted!\\' with a \\'CONFIRM\\' button. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of deleting the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[926,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'CONFIRM\\' button, located at approximately [926, 500], to confirm the deletion of the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense. This action is predicted to delete the expense and return to the previous screen or update the current screen to reflect the deletion. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'CONFIRM\\' button (located at approximately [926, 500] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense has been deleted from the application. The app returned to the \\'Home\\' screen, and the \\'Flight Tickets\\' item is no longer visible in the \\'Recent\\' list. This action successfully completed the active subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[695,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the trash can icon, estimated to be at [695, 900], to delete the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense. The icon is currently visible on the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen. This action is predicted to initiate the deletion process, possibly by showing a confirmation dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the trash can icon at [695, 900] was successful. It triggered a confirmation dialog at the bottom of the screen stating \\'item will be deleted!\\' with a \\'CONFIRM\\' button. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of deleting the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[926,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'CONFIRM\\' button, located at approximately [926, 500], to confirm the deletion of the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense. This action is predicted to delete the expense and return to the previous screen or update the current screen to reflect the deletion. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'CONFIRM\\' button successfully deleted the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense. The confirmation dialog closed, and the app returned to the main \\'Home\\' screen. The \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense is no longer visible in the \\'Recent\\' list, indicating the deletion was successful. This action completed the active subgoal.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[830,374],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense item, which is visible in the \\'Recent\\' list and displays \\'Flight Tickets 2023 Oct 6\\'. The item is located around coordinates [830, 374]. This action is predicted to open the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for \\'Flight Tickets\\', where the delete option should be available. Actual Outcome: The long press on the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense item at [830, 374] was successful. The app navigated from the main \\'Home\\' screen to the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for \\'Flight Tickets\\'. This screen displays the details of the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense (Amount: 97.91 USD, Date: 2023 Oct 6, Note: Urgent) and, crucially, a trash can icon in the upper right of the detail card and an \\'EDIT\\' button at the bottom. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of deleting the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense by making the delete option accessible.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[695,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the trash can icon, estimated to be at [695, 900], on the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for \\'Flight Tickets\\'. This action is predicted to trigger a confirmation dialog for deleting the expense. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the trash can icon (estimated at [695, 900]) on the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for \\'Flight Tickets\\' was successful. It triggered a confirmation dialog at the bottom of the screen stating \\'item will be deleted!\\' with a \\'CONFIRM\\' button. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of deleting the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[926,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'CONFIRM\\' button, located at approximately [926, 500], to confirm the deletion of the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense. This action is predicted to delete the expense and return to the previous screen or update the current screen to reflect the deletion. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'CONFIRM\\' button (located at approximately [926, 500] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense has been deleted from the application. The app returned to the \\'Home\\' screen, and the \\'Flight Tickets\\' item is no longer visible in the \\'Recent\\' list.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[926,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'CONFIRM\\' button, located at approximately [926, 500], to confirm the deletion of the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense. This action is predicted to delete the expense and return to the previous screen or update the current screen to reflect the deletion. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'CONFIRM\\' button successfully deleted the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense. The confirmation dialog closed, and the app returned to the main \\'Home\\' screen. The \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense is no longer visible in the \\'Recent\\' list, indicating the deletion was successful. This action completed the active subgoal.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[830,374],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense item, which is visible in the \\'Recent\\' list and displays \\'Flight Tickets 2023 Oct 6\\'. The item is located around coordinates [830, 374]. This action is predicted to open the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for \\'Flight Tickets\\', where the delete option should be available. Actual Outcome: The long press on the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense item at [830, 374] was successful. The app navigated from the main \\'Home\\' screen to the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for \\'Flight Tickets\\'. This screen displays the details of the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense (Amount: 97.91 USD, Date: 2023 Oct 6, Note: Urgent) and, crucially, a trash can icon in the upper right of the detail card and an \\'EDIT\\' button at the bottom. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of deleting the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense by making the delete option accessible.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[695,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the trash can icon, estimated to be at [695, 900], on the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for \\'Flight Tickets\\'. This action is predicted to trigger a confirmation dialog for deleting the expense. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the trash can icon (estimated at [695, 900]) on the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for \\'Flight Tickets\\' was successful. It triggered a confirmation dialog at the bottom of the screen stating \\'item will be deleted!\\' with a \\'CONFIRM\\' button. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of deleting the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[926,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'CONFIRM\\' button, located at approximately [926, 500], to confirm the deletion of the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense. This action is predicted to delete the expense and return to the previous screen or update the current screen to reflect the deletion. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'CONFIRM\\' button (located at approximately [926, 500] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense has been deleted from the application. The app returned to the \\'Home\\' screen, and the \\'Flight Tickets\\' item is no longer visible in the \\'Recent\\' list. This action successfully completed the active subgoal.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[743,334],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the \\'Taxi Fare\\' expense item, which is visible in the \\'Recent\\' list and displays \\'Taxi Fare 2023 Oct 7\\'. The item is located around coordinates [743, 334]. This action is predicted to open the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for \\'Taxi Fare\\', where the delete option should be available. Actual Outcome: The long press on the \\'Taxi Fare\\' expense item (located at [743, 334] in the previous screen) was successful. The app navigated from the \\'Home\\' screen to the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for \\'Taxi Fare\\'. This screen displays the details of the \\'Taxi Fare\\' expense (Amount: 237.89 USD, Date: 2023 Oct 7, Note: A need), a trash can icon in the upper right of the detail card, and an \\'EDIT\\' button at the bottom. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of deleting the \\'Taxi Fare\\' expense by making the delete option accessible.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 42, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.40\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [75, 173, 96, 314], \\'text\\': \\'Home\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [145, 54, 165, 183], \\'text\\': \\'Totals\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [174, 55, 192, 256], \\'text\\': \\'OCT 15 22\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [220, 97, 231, 214], \\'text\\': \\'INCOME\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [238, 92, 262, 201], \\'text\\': \\'OusD\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [289, 97, 301, 242], \\'text\\': \\'OUTCOME\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [307, 92, 331, 201], \\'text\\': \\'OusD\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [403, 53, 451, 500], \\'text\\': \\'Expenses in this Week OCT 15 22\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [602, 36, 629, 378], \\'text\\': \\'Expense Detail\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [682, 247, 704, 461], \\'text\\': \\'Taxi Fare\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [746, 76, 761, 205], \\'text\\': \\'Amount\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [741, 246, 762, 448], \\'text\\': \\'237.89usD\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [792, 75, 807, 154], \\'text\\': \\'Date\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [790, 248, 807, 423], \\'text\\': \\'2023 Oct\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [833, 75, 850, 157], \\'text\\': \\'Note\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [834, 252, 845, 274], \\'text\\': \\'A\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [830, 280, 850, 380], \\'text\\': \\'need\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [918, 496, 934, 582], \\'text\\': \\'EDIT\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [902, 34, 952, 970]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 38, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 820, 37, 899]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 80, 37, 189]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[926,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'CONFIRM\\' button, located at approximately [926, 500], to confirm the deletion of the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense. This action is predicted to delete the expense and return to the previous screen or update the current screen to reflect the deletion. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'CONFIRM\\' button successfully deleted the \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense. The confirmation dialog closed, and the app returned to the main \\'Home\\' screen. The \\'Ride-Sharing\\' expense is no longer visible in the \\'Recent\\' list, indicating the deletion was successful. This action completed the active subgoal.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[830,374],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense item, which is visible in the \\'Recent\\' list and displays \\'Flight Tickets 2023 Oct 6\\'. The item is located around coordinates [830, 374]. This action is predicted to open the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for \\'Flight Tickets\\', where the delete option should be available. Actual Outcome: The long press on the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense item at [830, 374] was successful. The app navigated from the main \\'Home\\' screen to the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for \\'Flight Tickets\\'. This screen displays the details of the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense (Amount: 97.91 USD, Date: 2023 Oct 6, Note: Urgent) and, crucially, a trash can icon in the upper right of the detail card and an \\'EDIT\\' button at the bottom. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of deleting the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense by making the delete option accessible.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[695,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the trash can icon, estimated to be at [695, 900], on the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for \\'Flight Tickets\\'. This action is predicted to trigger a confirmation dialog for deleting the expense. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the trash can icon (estimated at [695, 900]) on the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for \\'Flight Tickets\\' was successful. It triggered a confirmation dialog at the bottom of the screen stating \\'item will be deleted!\\' with a \\'CONFIRM\\' button. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of deleting the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[926,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'CONFIRM\\' button, located at approximately [926, 500], to confirm the deletion of the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense. This action is predicted to delete the expense and return to the previous screen or update the current screen to reflect the deletion. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'CONFIRM\\' button (located at approximately [926, 500] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense has been deleted from the application. The app returned to the \\'Home\\' screen, and the \\'Flight Tickets\\' item is no longer visible in the \\'Recent\\' list. This action successfully completed the active subgoal.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[743,334],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the \\'Taxi Fare\\' expense item, which is visible in the \\'Recent\\' list and displays \\'Taxi Fare 2023 Oct 7\\'. The item is located around coordinates [743, 334]. This action is predicted to open the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for \\'Taxi Fare\\', where the delete option should be available. Actual Outcome: The long press on the \\'Taxi Fare\\' expense item (located at [743, 334] in the previous screen) was successful. The app navigated from the \\'Home\\' screen to the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for \\'Taxi Fare\\'. This screen displays the details of the \\'Taxi Fare\\' expense (Amount: 237.89 USD, Date: 2023 Oct 7, Note: A need), a trash can icon in the upper right of the detail card, and an \\'EDIT\\' button at the bottom. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of deleting the \\'Taxi Fare\\' expense by making the delete option accessible.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 11: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[830,374],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense item, which is visible in the \\'Recent\\' list and displays \\'Flight Tickets 2023 Oct 6\\'. The item is located around coordinates [830, 374]. This action is predicted to open the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for \\'Flight Tickets\\', where the delete option should be available. Actual Outcome: The long press on the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense item at [830, 374] was successful. The app navigated from the main \\'Home\\' screen to the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for \\'Flight Tickets\\'. This screen displays the details of the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense (Amount: 97.91 USD, Date: 2023 Oct 6, Note: Urgent) and, crucially, a trash can icon in the upper right of the detail card and an \\'EDIT\\' button at the bottom. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of deleting the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense by making the delete option accessible.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[695,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the trash can icon, estimated to be at [695, 900], on the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for \\'Flight Tickets\\'. This action is predicted to trigger a confirmation dialog for deleting the expense. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the trash can icon (estimated at [695, 900]) on the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for \\'Flight Tickets\\' was successful. It triggered a confirmation dialog at the bottom of the screen stating \\'item will be deleted!\\' with a \\'CONFIRM\\' button. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of deleting the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[926,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'CONFIRM\\' button, located at approximately [926, 500], to confirm the deletion of the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense. This action is predicted to delete the expense and return to the previous screen or update the current screen to reflect the deletion. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'CONFIRM\\' button (located at approximately [926, 500] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense has been deleted from the application. The app returned to the \\'Home\\' screen, and the \\'Flight Tickets\\' item is no longer visible in the \\'Recent\\' list. This action successfully completed the active subgoal.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[743,334],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the \\'Taxi Fare\\' expense item, which is visible in the \\'Recent\\' list and displays \\'Taxi Fare 2023 Oct 7\\'. The item is located around coordinates [743, 334]. This action is predicted to open the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for \\'Taxi Fare\\', where the delete option should be available. Actual Outcome: The long press on the \\'Taxi Fare\\' expense item (located at [743, 334] in the previous screen) was successful. The app navigated from the \\'Home\\' screen to the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for \\'Taxi Fare\\'. This screen displays the details of the \\'Taxi Fare\\' expense (Amount: 237.89 USD, Date: 2023 Oct 7, Note: A need), a trash can icon in the upper right of the detail card, and an \\'EDIT\\' button at the bottom. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of deleting the \\'Taxi Fare\\' expense by making the delete option accessible.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[695,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the trash can icon, estimated to be at [695, 900], on the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for \\'Taxi Fare\\'. This action is predicted to trigger a confirmation dialog for deleting the expense. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the trash can icon on the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for \\'Taxi Fare\\' was successful. As a result, a confirmation dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen with the message \\'item will be deleted!\\' and a \\'CONFIRM\\' button. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of deleting the \\'Taxi Fare\\' expense by presenting the necessary confirmation step.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[830,374],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense item, which is visible in the \\'Recent\\' list and displays \\'Flight Tickets 2023 Oct 6\\'. The item is located around coordinates [830, 374]. This action is predicted to open the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for \\'Flight Tickets\\', where the delete option should be available. Actual Outcome: The long press on the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense item at [830, 374] was successful. The app navigated from the main \\'Home\\' screen to the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for \\'Flight Tickets\\'. This screen displays the details of the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense (Amount: 97.91 USD, Date: 2023 Oct 6, Note: Urgent) and, crucially, a trash can icon in the upper right of the detail card and an \\'EDIT\\' button at the bottom. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of deleting the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense by making the delete option accessible.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[695,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the trash can icon, estimated to be at [695, 900], on the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for \\'Flight Tickets\\'. This action is predicted to trigger a confirmation dialog for deleting the expense. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the trash can icon (estimated at [695, 900]) on the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for \\'Flight Tickets\\' was successful. It triggered a confirmation dialog at the bottom of the screen stating \\'item will be deleted!\\' with a \\'CONFIRM\\' button. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of deleting the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[926,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'CONFIRM\\' button, located at approximately [926, 500], to confirm the deletion of the \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense. This action is predicted to delete the expense and return to the previous screen or update the current screen to reflect the deletion. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'CONFIRM\\' button (located at approximately [926, 500] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'Flight Tickets\\' expense has been deleted from the application. The app returned to the \\'Home\\' screen, and the \\'Flight Tickets\\' item is no longer visible in the \\'Recent\\' list. This action successfully completed the active subgoal.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[743,334],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the \\'Taxi Fare\\' expense item, which is visible in the \\'Recent\\' list and displays \\'Taxi Fare 2023 Oct 7\\'. The item is located around coordinates [743, 334]. This action is predicted to open the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for \\'Taxi Fare\\', where the delete option should be available. Actual Outcome: The long press on the \\'Taxi Fare\\' expense item (located at [743, 334] in the previous screen) was successful. The app navigated from the \\'Home\\' screen to the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for \\'Taxi Fare\\'. This screen displays the details of the \\'Taxi Fare\\' expense (Amount: 237.89 USD, Date: 2023 Oct 7, Note: A need), a trash can icon in the upper right of the detail card, and an \\'EDIT\\' button at the bottom. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of deleting the \\'Taxi Fare\\' expense by making the delete option accessible.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[695,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the trash can icon, estimated to be at [695, 900], on the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for \\'Taxi Fare\\'. This action is predicted to trigger a confirmation dialog for deleting the expense. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the trash can icon on the \\'Expense Detail\\' screen for \\'Taxi Fare\\' was successful. As a result, a confirmation dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen with the message \\'item will be deleted!\\' and a \\'CONFIRM\\' button. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of deleting the \\'Taxi Fare\\' expense by presenting the necessary confirmation step.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 12: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",
