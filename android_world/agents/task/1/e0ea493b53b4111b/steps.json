Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is predicted to open the Contacts app. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Contacts\\' app icon successfully opened the Contacts application. A pop-up dialog appeared, asking for permission to send notifications, with options to \"Allow\" or \"Don\\'t allow\". This action has brought the agent closer to the user\\'s goal by opening the required application. The active Subgoal \"Find and Open Contacts App\" is now complete. The immediate next step is to handle the notification pop-up.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'[Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [54, 710, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [78, 161, 98, 455], \\'text\\': \\'Search contacts\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [146, 120, 189, 880], \\'text\\': \\'Phon Now you can find Settings and Help feedback here\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [433, 203, 482, 803], \\'text\\': \\'Allow Contacts to send you notifications?\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [537, 459, 552, 547], \\'text\\': \\'Allow\\'}\", \\'{\\\\\\'box_2d\\\\\\': [601, 416, 617, 585], \\\\\\'text\\\\\\': \"Don\\\\\\'t allow\"}\\', \"{\\'box_2d\\': [945, 101, 959, 236], \\'text\\': \\'Contacts\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [943, 425, 962, 575], \\'text\\': \\'Highlights\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [945, 736, 958, 781], \\'text\\': \\'Fix\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [945, 813, 962, 932], \\'text\\': \\'manage\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [514, 115, 577, 885]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [578, 113, 643, 884]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [892, 368, 991, 637]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [808, 798, 871, 948]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [890, 661, 984, 990]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 856, 107, 935]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [900, 87, 965, 248]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Their number is +13920741751.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 3 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (from [900, 500] to [200, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is predicted to reveal the app drawer, which contains a list of all installed applications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen now displays a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the user instruction by making the Contacts app accessible.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[642,389],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Contacts app icon, which is labeled \"Contacts\" and located at approximately [642, 389]. This action is predicted to open the Contacts app. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Contacts\\' app icon successfully opened the Contacts application. A pop-up dialog appeared, asking for permission to send notifications, with options to \"Allow\" or \"Don\\'t allow\". This action has brought the agent closer to the user\\'s goal by opening the required application. The active Subgoal \"Find and Open Contacts App\" is now complete. The immediate next step is to handle the notification pop-up.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[544,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Allow\" button to grant notification permissions to the Contacts app. The \"Allow\" button is located within the bounding box [514, 115, 577, 885] and the text \"Allow\" is detected at [537, 459]. Tapping the center of the button at [544, 500] is predicted to dismiss the pop-up and allow further interaction with the Contacts app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Allow\\' button for notification permissions was successful. The pop-up dialog was dismissed, and the Contacts app\\'s main screen is now visible. This screen displays \\'No contacts yet\\' and a \\'+\\' button in the bottom right, which is used to add a new contact. The agent is now closer to completing the active subgoal \\'Initiate New Contact Creation\\' as the necessary UI element to start creating a contact is accessible.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 3: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[839,873],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'+\\' button located at approximately [839, 873] (within bounding box [807, 797, 871, 949]) to initiate the creation of a new contact. This action is predicted to open a new screen where contact details like name and phone number can be entered.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is predicted to reveal the app drawer, which contains a list of all installed applications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen now displays a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the user instruction by making the Contacts app accessible.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[642,389],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Contacts app icon, which is labeled \"Contacts\" and located at approximately [642, 389]. This action is predicted to open the Contacts app. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Contacts\\' app icon successfully opened the Contacts application. A pop-up dialog appeared, asking for permission to send notifications, with options to \"Allow\" or \"Don\\'t allow\". This action has brought the agent closer to the user\\'s goal by opening the required application. The active Subgoal \"Find and Open Contacts App\" is now complete. The immediate next step is to handle the notification pop-up.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[544,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Allow\" button to grant notification permissions to the Contacts app. The \"Allow\" button is located within the bounding box [514, 115, 577, 885] and the text \"Allow\" is detected at [537, 459]. Tapping the center of the button at [544, 500] is predicted to dismiss the pop-up and allow further interaction with the Contacts app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Allow\\' button for notification permissions was successful. The pop-up dialog was dismissed, and the Contacts app\\'s main screen is now visible. This screen displays \\'No contacts yet\\' and a \\'+\\' button in the bottom right, which is used to add a new contact. The agent is now closer to completing the active subgoal \\'Initiate New Contact Creation\\' as the necessary UI element to start creating a contact is accessible.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[839,873],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'+\\' button located at approximately [839, 873] (within bounding box [807, 797, 871, 949]) to initiate the creation of a new contact. This action is predicted to open a new screen where contact details like name and phone number can be entered. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'+\\' button successfully navigated the agent to the \\'Create contact\\' screen. This screen presents various fields for entering contact information, including \\'First name\\', \\'Last name\\', \\'Phone\\', etc. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by making the contact creation form accessible. The active Subgoal \\'Initiate New Contact Creation\\' is now completed.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.36\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [76, 142, 101, 519], \\'text\\': \\'Create contact\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [81, 733, 97, 819], \\'text\\': \\'Save\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [292, 403, 316, 600], \\'text\\': \\'Add picture\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [378, 160, 398, 354], \\'text\\': \\'First name\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [458, 164, 474, 351], \\'text\\': \\'Last name\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [541, 159, 566, 340], \\'text\\': \\'Company\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [628, 164, 646, 282], \\'text\\': \\'Phone\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [678, 164, 692, 243], \\'text\\': \\'Label\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 163, 725, 288], \\'text\\': \\'Mobile\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [793, 164, 811, 263], \\'text\\': \\'Email\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [843, 164, 857, 243], \\'text\\': \\'Label\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [872, 164, 889, 273], \\'text\\': \\'Home\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [956, 162, 976, 446], \\'text\\': \\'Sianificant date\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [772, 114, 837, 872]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [358, 118, 423, 871]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [435, 118, 500, 872]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [521, 116, 586, 871]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [606, 118, 672, 874]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [683, 123, 747, 545]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [848, 123, 913, 520]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 667, 112, 888]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [145, 344, 319, 656]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [70, 899, 111, 975]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [947, 29, 984, 105]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [534, 28, 567, 109]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [360, 19, 420, 118]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [780, 26, 828, 113]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [11, 814, 41, 951]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [354, 861, 417, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 193, 40, 244]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Their number is +13920741751.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 4 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (from [900, 500] to [200, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is predicted to reveal the app drawer, which contains a list of all installed applications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen now displays a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the user instruction by making the Contacts app accessible.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[642,389],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Contacts app icon, which is labeled \"Contacts\" and located at approximately [642, 389]. This action is predicted to open the Contacts app. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Contacts\\' app icon successfully opened the Contacts application. A pop-up dialog appeared, asking for permission to send notifications, with options to \"Allow\" or \"Don\\'t allow\". This action has brought the agent closer to the user\\'s goal by opening the required application. The active Subgoal \"Find and Open Contacts App\" is now complete. The immediate next step is to handle the notification pop-up.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[544,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Allow\" button to grant notification permissions to the Contacts app. The \"Allow\" button is located within the bounding box [514, 115, 577, 885] and the text \"Allow\" is detected at [537, 459]. Tapping the center of the button at [544, 500] is predicted to dismiss the pop-up and allow further interaction with the Contacts app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Allow\\' button for notification permissions was successful. The pop-up dialog was dismissed, and the Contacts app\\'s main screen is now visible. This screen displays \\'No contacts yet\\' and a \\'+\\' button in the bottom right, which is used to add a new contact. The agent is now closer to completing the active subgoal \\'Initiate New Contact Creation\\' as the necessary UI element to start creating a contact is accessible.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[839,873],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'+\\' button located at approximately [839, 873] (within bounding box [807, 797, 871, 949]) to initiate the creation of a new contact. This action is predicted to open a new screen where contact details like name and phone number can be entered. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'+\\' button successfully navigated the agent to the \\'Create contact\\' screen. This screen presents various fields for entering contact information, including \\'First name\\', \\'Last name\\', \\'Phone\\', etc. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by making the contact creation form accessible. The active Subgoal \\'Initiate New Contact Creation\\' is now completed.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 4: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[388,257],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'First name\\' text field, which is currently empty. This action is predicted to select the \\'First name\\' field and open the virtual keyboard, allowing text input. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open App Drawer\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The app drawer is open, displaying a list of installed applications.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up from the bottom of the screen to open the app drawer.\",\"PlannedNextSteps\":[\"Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (e.g., starting at y=900) to open the app drawer.\"],\"status\":\"completed\"},{\"ID\":2,\"Title\":\"Find and Open Contacts App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Contacts app is open.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is predicted to reveal the app drawer, which contains a list of all installed applications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen now displays a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the user instruction by making the Contacts app accessible.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[642,389],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Contacts app icon, which is labeled \"Contacts\" and located at approximately [642, 389]. This action is predicted to open the Contacts app. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Contacts\\' app icon successfully opened the Contacts application. A pop-up dialog appeared, asking for permission to send notifications, with options to \"Allow\" or \"Don\\'t allow\". This action has brought the agent closer to the user\\'s goal by opening the required application. The active Subgoal \"Find and Open Contacts App\" is now complete. The immediate next step is to handle the notification pop-up.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[544,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Allow\" button to grant notification permissions to the Contacts app. The \"Allow\" button is located within the bounding box [514, 115, 577, 885] and the text \"Allow\" is detected at [537, 459]. Tapping the center of the button at [544, 500] is predicted to dismiss the pop-up and allow further interaction with the Contacts app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Allow\\' button for notification permissions was successful. The pop-up dialog was dismissed, and the Contacts app\\'s main screen is now visible. This screen displays \\'No contacts yet\\' and a \\'+\\' button in the bottom right, which is used to add a new contact. The agent is now closer to completing the active subgoal \\'Initiate New Contact Creation\\' as the necessary UI element to start creating a contact is accessible.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[839,873],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'+\\' button located at approximately [839, 873] (within bounding box [807, 797, 871, 949]) to initiate the creation of a new contact. This action is predicted to open a new screen where contact details like name and phone number can be entered. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'+\\' button successfully navigated the agent to the \\'Create contact\\' screen. This screen presents various fields for entering contact information, including \\'First name\\', \\'Last name\\', \\'Phone\\', etc. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by making the contact creation form accessible. The active Subgoal \\'Initiate New Contact Creation\\' is now completed.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[388,257],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'First name\\' text field, which is currently empty. This action is predicted to select the \\'First name\\' field and open the virtual keyboard, allowing text input. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'First name\\' field at [388, 257] was unsuccessful in selecting the text field. Instead, an error pop-up titled \"com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\" appeared, obstructing the \\'Create contact\\' screen. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The error pop-up needs to be closed to continue.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.36\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'[Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'[Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [75, 141, 101, 519], \\'text\\': \\'Create contact\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [82, 735, 97, 819], \\'text\\': \\'Save\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [295, 404, 315, 598], \\'text\\': \\'Add picture\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [379, 162, 398, 354], \\'text\\': \\'First name\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [434, 116, 486, 813], \\'text\\': \\'com.google androidenv ac cessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [516, 254, 540, 410], \\'text\\': \\'App info\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [570, 256, 591, 435], \\'text\\': \\'Close app\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [628, 164, 646, 282], \\'text\\': \\'Phone\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [678, 164, 692, 243], \\'text\\': \\'Label\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 163, 725, 288], \\'text\\': \\'Mobile\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [793, 164, 811, 263], \\'text\\': \\'Email\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [843, 164, 857, 243], \\'text\\': \\'Label\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [872, 164, 889, 273], \\'text\\': \\'Home\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [956, 162, 976, 446], \\'text\\': \\'Sianificant date\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [772, 114, 836, 871]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [683, 121, 747, 546]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [848, 122, 914, 520]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [614, 119, 671, 867]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 667, 112, 887]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [145, 347, 278, 655]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 892, 112, 979]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [774, 18, 833, 122]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [130, 662, 332, 1000]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Their number is +13920741751.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (from [900, 500] to [200, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is predicted to reveal the app drawer, which contains a list of all installed applications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen now displays a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the user instruction by making the Contacts app accessible.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[642,389],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Contacts app icon, which is labeled \"Contacts\" and located at approximately [642, 389]. This action is predicted to open the Contacts app. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Contacts\\' app icon successfully opened the Contacts application. A pop-up dialog appeared, asking for permission to send notifications, with options to \"Allow\" or \"Don\\'t allow\". This action has brought the agent closer to the user\\'s goal by opening the required application. The active Subgoal \"Find and Open Contacts App\" is now complete. The immediate next step is to handle the notification pop-up.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[544,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Allow\" button to grant notification permissions to the Contacts app. The \"Allow\" button is located within the bounding box [514, 115, 577, 885] and the text \"Allow\" is detected at [537, 459]. Tapping the center of the button at [544, 500] is predicted to dismiss the pop-up and allow further interaction with the Contacts app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Allow\\' button for notification permissions was successful. The pop-up dialog was dismissed, and the Contacts app\\'s main screen is now visible. This screen displays \\'No contacts yet\\' and a \\'+\\' button in the bottom right, which is used to add a new contact. The agent is now closer to completing the active subgoal \\'Initiate New Contact Creation\\' as the necessary UI element to start creating a contact is accessible.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[839,873],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'+\\' button located at approximately [839, 873] (within bounding box [807, 797, 871, 949]) to initiate the creation of a new contact. This action is predicted to open a new screen where contact details like name and phone number can be entered. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'+\\' button successfully navigated the agent to the \\'Create contact\\' screen. This screen presents various fields for entering contact information, including \\'First name\\', \\'Last name\\', \\'Phone\\', etc. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by making the contact creation form accessible. The active Subgoal \\'Initiate New Contact Creation\\' is now completed.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[388,257],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'First name\\' text field, which is currently empty. This action is predicted to select the \\'First name\\' field and open the virtual keyboard, allowing text input. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'First name\\' field at [388, 257] was unsuccessful in selecting the text field. Instead, an error pop-up titled \"com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\" appeared, obstructing the \\'Create contact\\' screen. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The error pop-up needs to be closed to continue.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 5: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Close app\\' button on the error pop-up. The \\'Close app\\' button is located at approximately [580, 345]. This action is predicted to dismiss the error pop-up and allow interaction with the \\'Create contact\\' screen again. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open App Drawer\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The app drawer is open, displaying a list of installed applications.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up from the bottom of the screen to open the app drawer.\",\"PlannedNextSteps\":[\"Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (e.g., starting at y=900) to open the app drawer.\"],\"status\":\"completed\"},{\"ID\":2,\"Title\":\"Find and Open Contacts App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Contacts app is open.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[642,389],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Contacts app icon, which is labeled \"Contacts\" and located at approximately [642, 389]. This action is predicted to open the Contacts app. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Contacts\\' app icon successfully opened the Contacts application. A pop-up dialog appeared, asking for permission to send notifications, with options to \"Allow\" or \"Don\\'t allow\". This action has brought the agent closer to the user\\'s goal by opening the required application. The active Subgoal \"Find and Open Contacts App\" is now complete. The immediate next step is to handle the notification pop-up.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[544,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Allow\" button to grant notification permissions to the Contacts app. The \"Allow\" button is located within the bounding box [514, 115, 577, 885] and the text \"Allow\" is detected at [537, 459]. Tapping the center of the button at [544, 500] is predicted to dismiss the pop-up and allow further interaction with the Contacts app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Allow\\' button for notification permissions was successful. The pop-up dialog was dismissed, and the Contacts app\\'s main screen is now visible. This screen displays \\'No contacts yet\\' and a \\'+\\' button in the bottom right, which is used to add a new contact. The agent is now closer to completing the active subgoal \\'Initiate New Contact Creation\\' as the necessary UI element to start creating a contact is accessible.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[839,873],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'+\\' button located at approximately [839, 873] (within bounding box [807, 797, 871, 949]) to initiate the creation of a new contact. This action is predicted to open a new screen where contact details like name and phone number can be entered. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'+\\' button successfully navigated the agent to the \\'Create contact\\' screen. This screen presents various fields for entering contact information, including \\'First name\\', \\'Last name\\', \\'Phone\\', etc. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by making the contact creation form accessible. The active Subgoal \\'Initiate New Contact Creation\\' is now completed.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[388,257],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'First name\\' text field, which is currently empty. This action is predicted to select the \\'First name\\' field and open the virtual keyboard, allowing text input. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'First name\\' field at [388, 257] was unsuccessful in selecting the text field. Instead, an error pop-up titled \"com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\" appeared, obstructing the \\'Create contact\\' screen. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The error pop-up needs to be closed to continue.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Close app\\' button on the error pop-up. The \\'Close app\\' button is located at approximately [580, 345]. This action is predicted to dismiss the error pop-up and allow interaction with the \\'Create contact\\' screen again. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Close app\\' button successfully dismissed the error pop-up. The \\'Create contact\\' screen is now fully accessible. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by removing the obstruction.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.37\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [76, 142, 101, 519], \\'text\\': \\'Create contact\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [81, 733, 97, 819], \\'text\\': \\'Save\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [292, 403, 316, 600], \\'text\\': \\'Add picture\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [378, 160, 398, 354], \\'text\\': \\'First name\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [458, 164, 474, 351], \\'text\\': \\'Last name\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [541, 159, 566, 340], \\'text\\': \\'Company\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [628, 164, 646, 282], \\'text\\': \\'Phone\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [678, 164, 692, 243], \\'text\\': \\'Label\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 163, 725, 288], \\'text\\': \\'Mobile\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [793, 164, 811, 263], \\'text\\': \\'Email\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [843, 164, 857, 243], \\'text\\': \\'Label\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [872, 164, 889, 273], \\'text\\': \\'Home\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [956, 162, 976, 446], \\'text\\': \\'Sianificant date\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [772, 114, 836, 871]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [358, 118, 423, 871]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [435, 118, 500, 872]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [521, 116, 586, 871]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [606, 118, 672, 874]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [683, 123, 747, 545]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [848, 123, 913, 520]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 665, 113, 888]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [70, 899, 111, 975]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [145, 344, 319, 656]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [947, 29, 984, 105]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [534, 28, 567, 109]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [780, 27, 828, 113]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [360, 19, 420, 118]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [11, 813, 41, 950]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [354, 861, 416, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 194, 40, 244]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"First name\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nCreate a new contact for Hugo Pereira. Their number is +13920741751.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[642,389],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Contacts app icon, which is labeled \"Contacts\" and located at approximately [642, 389]. This action is predicted to open the Contacts app. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Contacts\\' app icon successfully opened the Contacts application. A pop-up dialog appeared, asking for permission to send notifications, with options to \"Allow\" or \"Don\\'t allow\". This action has brought the agent closer to the user\\'s goal by opening the required application. The active Subgoal \"Find and Open Contacts App\" is now complete. The immediate next step is to handle the notification pop-up.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[544,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Allow\" button to grant notification permissions to the Contacts app. The \"Allow\" button is located within the bounding box [514, 115, 577, 885] and the text \"Allow\" is detected at [537, 459]. Tapping the center of the button at [544, 500] is predicted to dismiss the pop-up and allow further interaction with the Contacts app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Allow\\' button for notification permissions was successful. The pop-up dialog was dismissed, and the Contacts app\\'s main screen is now visible. This screen displays \\'No contacts yet\\' and a \\'+\\' button in the bottom right, which is used to add a new contact. The agent is now closer to completing the active subgoal \\'Initiate New Contact Creation\\' as the necessary UI element to start creating a contact is accessible.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[839,873],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'+\\' button located at approximately [839, 873] (within bounding box [807, 797, 871, 949]) to initiate the creation of a new contact. This action is predicted to open a new screen where contact details like name and phone number can be entered. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'+\\' button successfully navigated the agent to the \\'Create contact\\' screen. This screen presents various fields for entering contact information, including \\'First name\\', \\'Last name\\', \\'Phone\\', etc. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by making the contact creation form accessible. The active Subgoal \\'Initiate New Contact Creation\\' is now completed.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[388,257],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'First name\\' text field, which is currently empty. This action is predicted to select the \\'First name\\' field and open the virtual keyboard, allowing text input. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'First name\\' field at [388, 257] was unsuccessful in selecting the text field. Instead, an error pop-up titled \"com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\" appeared, obstructing the \\'Create contact\\' screen. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The error pop-up needs to be closed to continue.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Close app\\' button on the error pop-up. The \\'Close app\\' button is located at approximately [580, 345]. This action is predicted to dismiss the error pop-up and allow interaction with the \\'Create contact\\' screen again. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Close app\\' button successfully dismissed the error pop-up. The \\'Create contact\\' screen is now fully accessible. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by removing the obstruction.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 6: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[390,494],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'First name\\' text field, which is currently empty. The field is located around [390, 494] (center of bounding box [358, 118, 423, 871]). This action is predicted to select the \\'First name\\' field and open the virtual keyboard, allowing text input. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open App Drawer\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The app drawer is open, displaying a list of installed applications.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up from the bottom of the screen to open the app drawer.\",\"PlannedNextSteps\":[\"Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (e.g., starting at y=900) to open the app drawer.\"],\"status\":\"completed\"},{\"ID\":2,\"Title\":\"Find and Open Contacts App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Contacts app is open.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[544,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Allow\" button to grant notification permissions to the Contacts app. The \"Allow\" button is located within the bounding box [514, 115, 577, 885] and the text \"Allow\" is detected at [537, 459]. Tapping the center of the button at [544, 500] is predicted to dismiss the pop-up and allow further interaction with the Contacts app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Allow\\' button for notification permissions was successful. The pop-up dialog was dismissed, and the Contacts app\\'s main screen is now visible. This screen displays \\'No contacts yet\\' and a \\'+\\' button in the bottom right, which is used to add a new contact. The agent is now closer to completing the active subgoal \\'Initiate New Contact Creation\\' as the necessary UI element to start creating a contact is accessible.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[839,873],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'+\\' button located at approximately [839, 873] (within bounding box [807, 797, 871, 949]) to initiate the creation of a new contact. This action is predicted to open a new screen where contact details like name and phone number can be entered. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'+\\' button successfully navigated the agent to the \\'Create contact\\' screen. This screen presents various fields for entering contact information, including \\'First name\\', \\'Last name\\', \\'Phone\\', etc. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by making the contact creation form accessible. The active Subgoal \\'Initiate New Contact Creation\\' is now completed.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[388,257],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'First name\\' text field, which is currently empty. This action is predicted to select the \\'First name\\' field and open the virtual keyboard, allowing text input. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'First name\\' field at [388, 257] was unsuccessful in selecting the text field. Instead, an error pop-up titled \"com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\" appeared, obstructing the \\'Create contact\\' screen. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The error pop-up needs to be closed to continue.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Close app\\' button on the error pop-up. The \\'Close app\\' button is located at approximately [580, 345]. This action is predicted to dismiss the error pop-up and allow interaction with the \\'Create contact\\' screen again. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Close app\\' button successfully dismissed the error pop-up. The \\'Create contact\\' screen is now fully accessible. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by removing the obstruction.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[390,494],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'First name\\' text field, which is currently empty. The field is located around [390, 494] (center of bounding box [358, 118, 423, 871]). This action is predicted to select the \\'First name\\' field and open the virtual keyboard, allowing text input. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'First name\\' text field at [390, 494] was successful. The \\'First name\\' field is now selected, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, as indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' at the bottom of the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal \\'Enter Contact Name\\'.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"First name\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Their number is +13920741751.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[544,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Allow\" button to grant notification permissions to the Contacts app. The \"Allow\" button is located within the bounding box [514, 115, 577, 885] and the text \"Allow\" is detected at [537, 459]. Tapping the center of the button at [544, 500] is predicted to dismiss the pop-up and allow further interaction with the Contacts app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Allow\\' button for notification permissions was successful. The pop-up dialog was dismissed, and the Contacts app\\'s main screen is now visible. This screen displays \\'No contacts yet\\' and a \\'+\\' button in the bottom right, which is used to add a new contact. The agent is now closer to completing the active subgoal \\'Initiate New Contact Creation\\' as the necessary UI element to start creating a contact is accessible.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[839,873],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'+\\' button located at approximately [839, 873] (within bounding box [807, 797, 871, 949]) to initiate the creation of a new contact. This action is predicted to open a new screen where contact details like name and phone number can be entered. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'+\\' button successfully navigated the agent to the \\'Create contact\\' screen. This screen presents various fields for entering contact information, including \\'First name\\', \\'Last name\\', \\'Phone\\', etc. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by making the contact creation form accessible. The active Subgoal \\'Initiate New Contact Creation\\' is now completed.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[388,257],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'First name\\' text field, which is currently empty. This action is predicted to select the \\'First name\\' field and open the virtual keyboard, allowing text input. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'First name\\' field at [388, 257] was unsuccessful in selecting the text field. Instead, an error pop-up titled \"com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\" appeared, obstructing the \\'Create contact\\' screen. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The error pop-up needs to be closed to continue.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Close app\\' button on the error pop-up. The \\'Close app\\' button is located at approximately [580, 345]. This action is predicted to dismiss the error pop-up and allow interaction with the \\'Create contact\\' screen again. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Close app\\' button successfully dismissed the error pop-up. The \\'Create contact\\' screen is now fully accessible. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by removing the obstruction.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[390,494],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'First name\\' text field, which is currently empty. The field is located around [390, 494] (center of bounding box [358, 118, 423, 871]). This action is predicted to select the \\'First name\\' field and open the virtual keyboard, allowing text input. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'First name\\' text field at [390, 494] was successful. The \\'First name\\' field is now selected, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, as indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' at the bottom of the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal \\'Enter Contact Name\\'.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 7: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Hugo\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Hugo\\' into the currently focused \\'First name\\' field. The \\'First name\\' field is currently empty. This action is predicted to populate the \\'First name\\' field with \\'Hugo\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open App Drawer\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The app drawer is open, displaying a list of installed applications.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up from the bottom of the screen to open the app drawer.\",\"PlannedNextSteps\":[\"Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (e.g., starting at y=900) to open the app drawer.\"],\"status\":\"completed\"},{\"ID\":2,\"Title\":\"Find and Open Contacts App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Contacts app is open.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[839,873],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'+\\' button located at approximately [839, 873] (within bounding box [807, 797, 871, 949]) to initiate the creation of a new contact. This action is predicted to open a new screen where contact details like name and phone number can be entered. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'+\\' button successfully navigated the agent to the \\'Create contact\\' screen. This screen presents various fields for entering contact information, including \\'First name\\', \\'Last name\\', \\'Phone\\', etc. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by making the contact creation form accessible. The active Subgoal \\'Initiate New Contact Creation\\' is now completed.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[388,257],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'First name\\' text field, which is currently empty. This action is predicted to select the \\'First name\\' field and open the virtual keyboard, allowing text input. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'First name\\' field at [388, 257] was unsuccessful in selecting the text field. Instead, an error pop-up titled \"com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\" appeared, obstructing the \\'Create contact\\' screen. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The error pop-up needs to be closed to continue.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Close app\\' button on the error pop-up. The \\'Close app\\' button is located at approximately [580, 345]. This action is predicted to dismiss the error pop-up and allow interaction with the \\'Create contact\\' screen again. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Close app\\' button successfully dismissed the error pop-up. The \\'Create contact\\' screen is now fully accessible. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by removing the obstruction.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[390,494],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'First name\\' text field, which is currently empty. The field is located around [390, 494] (center of bounding box [358, 118, 423, 871]). This action is predicted to select the \\'First name\\' field and open the virtual keyboard, allowing text input. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'First name\\' text field at [390, 494] was successful. The \\'First name\\' field is now selected, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, as indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' at the bottom of the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal \\'Enter Contact Name\\'.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Hugo\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Hugo\\' into the currently focused \\'First name\\' field. The \\'First name\\' field is currently empty. This action is predicted to populate the \\'First name\\' field with \\'Hugo\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Hugo\\' into the \\'First name\\' field was successful. The text \\'Hugo\\' is now visible in the \\'First name\\' field. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal \\'Enter Contact Name\\'.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.37\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [76, 142, 101, 519], \\'text\\': \\'Create contact\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [81, 733, 97, 819], \\'text\\': \\'Save\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [292, 403, 316, 600], \\'text\\': \\'Add picture\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [353, 163, 367, 308], \\'text\\': \\'First name\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [379, 163, 404, 271], \\'text\\': \\'Hugol\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [458, 164, 474, 351], \\'text\\': \\'Last name\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [541, 159, 566, 340], \\'text\\': \\'Company\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [628, 164, 646, 282], \\'text\\': \\'Phone\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [678, 164, 692, 243], \\'text\\': \\'Label\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 163, 725, 288], \\'text\\': \\'Mobile\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [793, 164, 811, 263], \\'text\\': \\'Email\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [843, 164, 857, 243], \\'text\\': \\'Label\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [872, 164, 889, 273], \\'text\\': \\'Home\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [435, 118, 500, 871]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [771, 113, 836, 870]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [521, 116, 586, 871]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [606, 118, 672, 874]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [358, 120, 424, 872]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [683, 123, 747, 545]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [847, 123, 913, 519]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 667, 112, 888]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [145, 345, 318, 655]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [70, 899, 111, 975]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [534, 30, 565, 106]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [778, 26, 831, 113]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [11, 814, 41, 951]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [361, 19, 418, 119]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [354, 861, 418, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 193, 39, 244]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"3\", text=\"Hugo\", resource-id=\"\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"com.google.android.contacts\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[137,858][933,1007]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"Hugo\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Their number is +13920741751.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[839,873],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'+\\' button located at approximately [839, 873] (within bounding box [807, 797, 871, 949]) to initiate the creation of a new contact. This action is predicted to open a new screen where contact details like name and phone number can be entered. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'+\\' button successfully navigated the agent to the \\'Create contact\\' screen. This screen presents various fields for entering contact information, including \\'First name\\', \\'Last name\\', \\'Phone\\', etc. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by making the contact creation form accessible. The active Subgoal \\'Initiate New Contact Creation\\' is now completed.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[388,257],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'First name\\' text field, which is currently empty. This action is predicted to select the \\'First name\\' field and open the virtual keyboard, allowing text input. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'First name\\' field at [388, 257] was unsuccessful in selecting the text field. Instead, an error pop-up titled \"com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\" appeared, obstructing the \\'Create contact\\' screen. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The error pop-up needs to be closed to continue.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Close app\\' button on the error pop-up. The \\'Close app\\' button is located at approximately [580, 345]. This action is predicted to dismiss the error pop-up and allow interaction with the \\'Create contact\\' screen again. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Close app\\' button successfully dismissed the error pop-up. The \\'Create contact\\' screen is now fully accessible. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by removing the obstruction.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[390,494],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'First name\\' text field, which is currently empty. The field is located around [390, 494] (center of bounding box [358, 118, 423, 871]). This action is predicted to select the \\'First name\\' field and open the virtual keyboard, allowing text input. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'First name\\' text field at [390, 494] was successful. The \\'First name\\' field is now selected, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, as indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' at the bottom of the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal \\'Enter Contact Name\\'.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Hugo\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Hugo\\' into the currently focused \\'First name\\' field. The \\'First name\\' field is currently empty. This action is predicted to populate the \\'First name\\' field with \\'Hugo\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Hugo\\' into the \\'First name\\' field was successful. The text \\'Hugo\\' is now visible in the \\'First name\\' field. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal \\'Enter Contact Name\\'.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 8: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[467,494],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Last name\\' input field, which is currently empty. The field is located around [467, 494] (center of bounding box [435, 118, 500, 871]). This action is predicted to select the \\'Last name\\' field, allowing text input for the last name. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open App Drawer\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The app drawer is open, displaying a list of installed applications.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up from the bottom of the screen to open the app drawer.\",\"PlannedNextSteps\":[\"Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (e.g., starting at y=900) to open the app drawer.\"],\"status\":\"completed\"},{\"ID\":2,\"Title\":\"Find and Open Contacts App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Contacts app is open.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is predicted to select the \\'First name\\' field and open the virtual keyboard, allowing text input. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'First name\\' field at [388, 257] was unsuccessful in selecting the text field. Instead, an error pop-up titled \"com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\" appeared, obstructing the \\'Create contact\\' screen. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The error pop-up needs to be closed to continue.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Close app\\' button on the error pop-up. The \\'Close app\\' button is located at approximately [580, 345]. This action is predicted to dismiss the error pop-up and allow interaction with the \\'Create contact\\' screen again. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Close app\\' button successfully dismissed the error pop-up. The \\'Create contact\\' screen is now fully accessible. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by removing the obstruction.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[390,494],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'First name\\' text field, which is currently empty. The field is located around [390, 494] (center of bounding box [358, 118, 423, 871]). This action is predicted to select the \\'First name\\' field and open the virtual keyboard, allowing text input. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'First name\\' text field at [390, 494] was successful. The \\'First name\\' field is now selected, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, as indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' at the bottom of the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal \\'Enter Contact Name\\'.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Hugo\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Hugo\\' into the currently focused \\'First name\\' field. The \\'First name\\' field is currently empty. This action is predicted to populate the \\'First name\\' field with \\'Hugo\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Hugo\\' into the \\'First name\\' field was successful. The text \\'Hugo\\' is now visible in the \\'First name\\' field. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal \\'Enter Contact Name\\'.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[467,494],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Last name\\' input field, which is currently empty. The field is located around [467, 494] (center of bounding box [435, 118, 500, 871]). This action is predicted to select the \\'Last name\\' field, allowing text input for the last name. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Last name\\' input field at [467, 494] was successful. The \\'Last name\\' field is now selected and focused, ready for text input. The virtual keyboard is still open. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal \\'Enter Contact Name\\'.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.38\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [76, 142, 101, 519], \\'text\\': \\'Create contact\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [81, 733, 97, 819], \\'text\\': \\'Save\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [292, 403, 316, 600], \\'text\\': \\'Add picture\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [352, 161, 367, 308], \\'text\\': \\'First name\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [430, 164, 444, 308], \\'text\\': \\'Last name\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [541, 159, 566, 340], \\'text\\': \\'Company\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [628, 164, 646, 282], \\'text\\': \\'Phone\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [678, 164, 692, 243], \\'text\\': \\'Label\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 163, 725, 288], \\'text\\': \\'Mobile\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [793, 164, 811, 263], \\'text\\': \\'Email\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [843, 164, 857, 243], \\'text\\': \\'Label\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [872, 164, 889, 273], \\'text\\': \\'Home\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [378, 158, 404, 267], \\'text\\': \\'Hugo\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [771, 113, 836, 870]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [434, 118, 500, 871]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [521, 116, 586, 871]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [358, 120, 423, 871]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [606, 118, 672, 874]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [683, 123, 747, 545]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [847, 123, 912, 519]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 667, 112, 888]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [145, 344, 319, 656]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [70, 899, 110, 975]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [534, 31, 564, 106]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [778, 26, 830, 113]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [11, 814, 41, 951]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [354, 863, 416, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [370, 28, 404, 108]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 193, 39, 244]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"4\", text=\"Last name\", resource-id=\"\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"com.google.android.contacts\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[137,1043][933,1192]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"Last name\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Their number is +13920741751.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[388,257],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'First name\\' text field, which is currently empty. This action is predicted to select the \\'First name\\' field and open the virtual keyboard, allowing text input. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'First name\\' field at [388, 257] was unsuccessful in selecting the text field. Instead, an error pop-up titled \"com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\" appeared, obstructing the \\'Create contact\\' screen. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The error pop-up needs to be closed to continue.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Close app\\' button on the error pop-up. The \\'Close app\\' button is located at approximately [580, 345]. This action is predicted to dismiss the error pop-up and allow interaction with the \\'Create contact\\' screen again. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Close app\\' button successfully dismissed the error pop-up. The \\'Create contact\\' screen is now fully accessible. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by removing the obstruction.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[390,494],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'First name\\' text field, which is currently empty. The field is located around [390, 494] (center of bounding box [358, 118, 423, 871]). This action is predicted to select the \\'First name\\' field and open the virtual keyboard, allowing text input. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'First name\\' text field at [390, 494] was successful. The \\'First name\\' field is now selected, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, as indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' at the bottom of the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal \\'Enter Contact Name\\'.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Hugo\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Hugo\\' into the currently focused \\'First name\\' field. The \\'First name\\' field is currently empty. This action is predicted to populate the \\'First name\\' field with \\'Hugo\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Hugo\\' into the \\'First name\\' field was successful. The text \\'Hugo\\' is now visible in the \\'First name\\' field. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal \\'Enter Contact Name\\'.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[467,494],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Last name\\' input field, which is currently empty. The field is located around [467, 494] (center of bounding box [435, 118, 500, 871]). This action is predicted to select the \\'Last name\\' field, allowing text input for the last name. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Last name\\' input field at [467, 494] was successful. The \\'Last name\\' field is now selected and focused, ready for text input. The virtual keyboard is still open. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal \\'Enter Contact Name\\'.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 9: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Pereira\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Pereira\\' into the currently focused \\'Last name\\' field. The \\'Last name\\' field is currently empty (placeholder text \\'Last name\\' is present). This action is predicted to populate the \\'Last name\\' field with \\'Pereira\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open App Drawer\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The app drawer is open, displaying a list of installed applications.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up from the bottom of the screen to open the app drawer.\",\"PlannedNextSteps\":[\"Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (e.g., starting at y=900) to open the app drawer.\"],\"status\":\"completed\"},{\"ID\":2,\"Title\":\"Find and Open Contacts App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Contacts app is open.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The \\'Close app\\' button is located at approximately [580, 345]. This action is predicted to dismiss the error pop-up and allow interaction with the \\'Create contact\\' screen again. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Close app\\' button successfully dismissed the error pop-up. The \\'Create contact\\' screen is now fully accessible. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by removing the obstruction.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[390,494],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'First name\\' text field, which is currently empty. The field is located around [390, 494] (center of bounding box [358, 118, 423, 871]). This action is predicted to select the \\'First name\\' field and open the virtual keyboard, allowing text input. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'First name\\' text field at [390, 494] was successful. The \\'First name\\' field is now selected, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, as indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' at the bottom of the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal \\'Enter Contact Name\\'.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Hugo\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Hugo\\' into the currently focused \\'First name\\' field. The \\'First name\\' field is currently empty. This action is predicted to populate the \\'First name\\' field with \\'Hugo\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Hugo\\' into the \\'First name\\' field was successful. The text \\'Hugo\\' is now visible in the \\'First name\\' field. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal \\'Enter Contact Name\\'.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[467,494],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Last name\\' input field, which is currently empty. The field is located around [467, 494] (center of bounding box [435, 118, 500, 871]). This action is predicted to select the \\'Last name\\' field, allowing text input for the last name. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Last name\\' input field at [467, 494] was successful. The \\'Last name\\' field is now selected and focused, ready for text input. The virtual keyboard is still open. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal \\'Enter Contact Name\\'.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Pereira\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Pereira\\' into the currently focused \\'Last name\\' field. The \\'Last name\\' field is currently empty (placeholder text \\'Last name\\' is present). This action is predicted to populate the \\'Last name\\' field with \\'Pereira\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Pereira\\' into the \\'Last name\\' field was successful. The text \\'Pereira\\' is now visible and correctly entered in the \\'Last name\\' field. This completes the active subgoal \\'Enter Contact Name\\', as both the first name \\'Hugo\\' and the last name \\'Pereira\\' have been entered.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"Pereira\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Their number is +13920741751.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Close app\\' button on the error pop-up. The \\'Close app\\' button is located at approximately [580, 345]. This action is predicted to dismiss the error pop-up and allow interaction with the \\'Create contact\\' screen again. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Close app\\' button successfully dismissed the error pop-up. The \\'Create contact\\' screen is now fully accessible. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by removing the obstruction.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[390,494],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'First name\\' text field, which is currently empty. The field is located around [390, 494] (center of bounding box [358, 118, 423, 871]). This action is predicted to select the \\'First name\\' field and open the virtual keyboard, allowing text input. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'First name\\' text field at [390, 494] was successful. The \\'First name\\' field is now selected, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, as indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' at the bottom of the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal \\'Enter Contact Name\\'.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Hugo\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Hugo\\' into the currently focused \\'First name\\' field. The \\'First name\\' field is currently empty. This action is predicted to populate the \\'First name\\' field with \\'Hugo\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Hugo\\' into the \\'First name\\' field was successful. The text \\'Hugo\\' is now visible in the \\'First name\\' field. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal \\'Enter Contact Name\\'.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[467,494],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Last name\\' input field, which is currently empty. The field is located around [467, 494] (center of bounding box [435, 118, 500, 871]). This action is predicted to select the \\'Last name\\' field, allowing text input for the last name. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Last name\\' input field at [467, 494] was successful. The \\'Last name\\' field is now selected and focused, ready for text input. The virtual keyboard is still open. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal \\'Enter Contact Name\\'.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Pereira\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Pereira\\' into the currently focused \\'Last name\\' field. The \\'Last name\\' field is currently empty (placeholder text \\'Last name\\' is present). This action is predicted to populate the \\'Last name\\' field with \\'Pereira\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Pereira\\' into the \\'Last name\\' field was successful. The text \\'Pereira\\' is now visible and correctly entered in the \\'Last name\\' field. This completes the active subgoal \\'Enter Contact Name\\', as both the first name \\'Hugo\\' and the last name \\'Pereira\\' have been entered.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 10: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[639,496],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Phone\\' input field. The field is currently empty. This action is predicted to select the \\'Phone\\' field and allow text input for the phone number. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open App Drawer\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The app drawer is open, displaying a list of installed applications.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up from the bottom of the screen to open the app drawer.\",\"PlannedNextSteps\":[\"Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (e.g., starting at y=900) to open the app drawer.\"],\"status\":\"completed\"},{\"ID\":2,\"Title\":\"Find and Open Contacts App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Contacts app is open.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The field is located around [390, 494] (center of bounding box [358, 118, 423, 871]). This action is predicted to select the \\'First name\\' field and open the virtual keyboard, allowing text input. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'First name\\' text field at [390, 494] was successful. The \\'First name\\' field is now selected, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, as indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' at the bottom of the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal \\'Enter Contact Name\\'.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Hugo\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Hugo\\' into the currently focused \\'First name\\' field. The \\'First name\\' field is currently empty. This action is predicted to populate the \\'First name\\' field with \\'Hugo\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Hugo\\' into the \\'First name\\' field was successful. The text \\'Hugo\\' is now visible in the \\'First name\\' field. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal \\'Enter Contact Name\\'.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[467,494],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Last name\\' input field, which is currently empty. The field is located around [467, 494] (center of bounding box [435, 118, 500, 871]). This action is predicted to select the \\'Last name\\' field, allowing text input for the last name. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Last name\\' input field at [467, 494] was successful. The \\'Last name\\' field is now selected and focused, ready for text input. The virtual keyboard is still open. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal \\'Enter Contact Name\\'.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Pereira\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Pereira\\' into the currently focused \\'Last name\\' field. The \\'Last name\\' field is currently empty (placeholder text \\'Last name\\' is present). This action is predicted to populate the \\'Last name\\' field with \\'Pereira\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Pereira\\' into the \\'Last name\\' field was successful. The text \\'Pereira\\' is now visible and correctly entered in the \\'Last name\\' field. This completes the active subgoal \\'Enter Contact Name\\', as both the first name \\'Hugo\\' and the last name \\'Pereira\\' have been entered.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[639,496],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Phone\\' input field. The field is currently empty. This action is predicted to select the \\'Phone\\' field and allow text input for the phone number. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Phone\\' input field at [639, 496] was successful. The \\'Phone\\' field is now selected and focused, ready for text input. The virtual keyboard is still open. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal \\'Enter Contact Phone Number\\'.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing.

The text you can edit is: \"Phone\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Their number is +13920741751.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[390,494],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'First name\\' text field, which is currently empty. The field is located around [390, 494] (center of bounding box [358, 118, 423, 871]). This action is predicted to select the \\'First name\\' field and open the virtual keyboard, allowing text input. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'First name\\' text field at [390, 494] was successful. The \\'First name\\' field is now selected, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, as indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' at the bottom of the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal \\'Enter Contact Name\\'.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Hugo\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Hugo\\' into the currently focused \\'First name\\' field. The \\'First name\\' field is currently empty. This action is predicted to populate the \\'First name\\' field with \\'Hugo\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Hugo\\' into the \\'First name\\' field was successful. The text \\'Hugo\\' is now visible in the \\'First name\\' field. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal \\'Enter Contact Name\\'.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[467,494],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Last name\\' input field, which is currently empty. The field is located around [467, 494] (center of bounding box [435, 118, 500, 871]). This action is predicted to select the \\'Last name\\' field, allowing text input for the last name. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Last name\\' input field at [467, 494] was successful. The \\'Last name\\' field is now selected and focused, ready for text input. The virtual keyboard is still open. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal \\'Enter Contact Name\\'.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Pereira\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Pereira\\' into the currently focused \\'Last name\\' field. The \\'Last name\\' field is currently empty (placeholder text \\'Last name\\' is present). This action is predicted to populate the \\'Last name\\' field with \\'Pereira\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Pereira\\' into the \\'Last name\\' field was successful. The text \\'Pereira\\' is now visible and correctly entered in the \\'Last name\\' field. This completes the active subgoal \\'Enter Contact Name\\', as both the first name \\'Hugo\\' and the last name \\'Pereira\\' have been entered.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[639,496],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Phone\\' input field. The field is currently empty. This action is predicted to select the \\'Phone\\' field and allow text input for the phone number. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Phone\\' input field at [639, 496] was successful. The \\'Phone\\' field is now selected and focused, ready for text input. The virtual keyboard is still open. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal \\'Enter Contact Phone Number\\'.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 11: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"+13920741751\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'+13920741751\\' into the currently focused \\'Phone\\' field. The \\'Phone\\' field is currently empty. This action is predicted to populate the \\'Phone\\' field with \\'+13920741751\\'.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"+1 392-074-1751\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"+1 392-074-1751\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### Screen Information Text After the Action ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

Their number is +13920741751.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Hugo\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Hugo\\' into the currently focused \\'First name\\' field. The \\'First name\\' field is currently empty. This action is predicted to populate the \\'First name\\' field with \\'Hugo\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Hugo\\' into the \\'First name\\' field was successful. The text \\'Hugo\\' is now visible in the \\'First name\\' field. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal \\'Enter Contact Name\\'.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[467,494],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Last name\\' input field, which is currently empty. The field is located around [467, 494] (center of bounding box [435, 118, 500, 871]). This action is predicted to select the \\'Last name\\' field, allowing text input for the last name. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Last name\\' input field at [467, 494] was successful. The \\'Last name\\' field is now selected and focused, ready for text input. The virtual keyboard is still open. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal \\'Enter Contact Name\\'.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Pereira\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Pereira\\' into the currently focused \\'Last name\\' field. The \\'Last name\\' field is currently empty (placeholder text \\'Last name\\' is present). This action is predicted to populate the \\'Last name\\' field with \\'Pereira\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Pereira\\' into the \\'Last name\\' field was successful. The text \\'Pereira\\' is now visible and correctly entered in the \\'Last name\\' field. This completes the active subgoal \\'Enter Contact Name\\', as both the first name \\'Hugo\\' and the last name \\'Pereira\\' have been entered.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[639,496],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Phone\\' input field. The field is currently empty. This action is predicted to select the \\'Phone\\' field and allow text input for the phone number. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Phone\\' input field at [639, 496] was successful. The \\'Phone\\' field is now selected and focused, ready for text input. The virtual keyboard is still open. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal \\'Enter Contact Phone Number\\'.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"+13920741751\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'+13920741751\\' into the currently focused \\'Phone\\' field. The \\'Phone\\' field is currently empty. This action is predicted to populate the \\'Phone\\' field with \\'+13920741751\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \\'+13920741751\\' into the \\'Phone\\' field was successful. The \\'Phone\\' field now displays \\'+1 392-074-1751\\'. This completes the active subgoal \\'Enter Contact Phone Number\\'. The agent is closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 12: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,776],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Save\\' button, located at the top right of the screen (center of bounding box [81, 733, 97, 819] is approximately [89, 776]). This action is predicted to save the newly created contact. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open App Drawer\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The app drawer is open, displaying a list of installed applications.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up from the bottom of the screen to open the app drawer.\",\"PlannedNextSteps\":[\"Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (e.g., starting at y=900) to open the app drawer.\"],\"status\":\"completed\"},{\"ID\":2,\"Title\":\"Find and Open Contacts App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Contacts app is open.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",
