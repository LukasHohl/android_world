If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11.

For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders.

If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9.

Perform a paste operation in the note and save the note.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 1 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (from [900, 500]) to the top (to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is predicted to reveal the list of installed applications, where I can then find and tap the Markor app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to a view listing installed applications. The Markor app is now visible in the app drawer. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Markor app.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 1: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[868,616],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon, which is currently visible in the app drawer. The icon is located near the text \\'Markor\\'. This action is predicted to launch the Markor application, moving to the next step of creating a new note.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Perform a paste operation in the note and save the note.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 2 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (from [900, 500]) to the top (to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is predicted to reveal the list of installed applications, where I can then find and tap the Markor app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to a view listing installed applications. The Markor app is now visible in the app drawer. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Markor app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[868,616],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon, which is currently visible in the app drawer. The icon is located near the text \\'Markor\\'. This action is predicted to launch the Markor application, moving to the next step of creating a new note. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Markor app icon successfully launched the Markor application. The screen changed from the app drawer to the Markor app\\'s main interface. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully completing the first subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 2: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

This button is currently visible and is expected to open a dialog or screen for creating a new note. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main interface is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Perform a paste operation in the note and save the note.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 3 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (from [900, 500]) to the top (to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is predicted to reveal the list of installed applications, where I can then find and tap the Markor app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to a view listing installed applications. The Markor app is now visible in the app drawer. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Markor app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[868,616],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon, which is currently visible in the app drawer. The icon is located near the text \\'Markor\\'. This action is predicted to launch the Markor application, moving to the next step of creating a new note. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Markor app icon successfully launched the Markor application. The screen changed from the app drawer to the Markor app\\'s main interface. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully completing the first subgoal.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[864,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the red \\'+\\' button located in the bottom right corner of the screen. This button is currently visible and is expected to open a dialog or screen for creating a new note. Actual Outcome: The last action (tapping the \\'+\\' button) was successful. It opened a dialog box for creating a new file, which is the expected behavior. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating and naming the new note. The dialog provides the necessary UI elements to input the filename and select the file type/extension.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 3: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[396,154],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text field containing \"my_note\" (coordinates [396, 154]) to select it. This should focus the text field and allow for text input or deletion. The text field currently displays \"my_note\". The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main interface is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Perform a paste operation in the note and save the note.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 4 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (from [900, 500]) to the top (to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is predicted to reveal the list of installed applications, where I can then find and tap the Markor app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to a view listing installed applications. The Markor app is now visible in the app drawer. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Markor app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[868,616],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon, which is currently visible in the app drawer. The icon is located near the text \\'Markor\\'. This action is predicted to launch the Markor application, moving to the next step of creating a new note. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Markor app icon successfully launched the Markor application. The screen changed from the app drawer to the Markor app\\'s main interface. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully completing the first subgoal.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[864,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the red \\'+\\' button located in the bottom right corner of the screen. This button is currently visible and is expected to open a dialog or screen for creating a new note. Actual Outcome: The last action (tapping the \\'+\\' button) was successful. It opened a dialog box for creating a new file, which is the expected behavior. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating and naming the new note. The dialog provides the necessary UI elements to input the filename and select the file type/extension.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[396,154],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text field containing \"my_note\" (coordinates [396, 154]) to select it. This should focus the text field and allow for text input or deletion. The text field currently displays \"my_note\". Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on the text field [396, 154] (intended to select \"my_note\"), resulted in an unexpected error pop-up stating \"com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\". This pop-up now obscures part of the screen and prevents interaction with the underlying dialog. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal; instead, it introduced an interruption that needs to be handled.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 4: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Close app\" button within the error pop-up. The button is located near the text \"Close app\" (bounding box [570, 256, 591, 435]). This action is predicted to dismiss the error pop-up and allow interaction with the underlying \"Create new file\" dialog again. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main interface is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nCreate a note in Markor named 2023_09_08_active_umbrella.txt. Perform a paste operation in the note and save the note.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (from [900, 500]) to the top (to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is predicted to reveal the list of installed applications, where I can then find and tap the Markor app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to a view listing installed applications. The Markor app is now visible in the app drawer. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Markor app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[868,616],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon, which is currently visible in the app drawer. The icon is located near the text \\'Markor\\'. This action is predicted to launch the Markor application, moving to the next step of creating a new note. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Markor app icon successfully launched the Markor application. The screen changed from the app drawer to the Markor app\\'s main interface. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully completing the first subgoal.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[864,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the red \\'+\\' button located in the bottom right corner of the screen. This button is currently visible and is expected to open a dialog or screen for creating a new note. Actual Outcome: The last action (tapping the \\'+\\' button) was successful. It opened a dialog box for creating a new file, which is the expected behavior. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating and naming the new note. The dialog provides the necessary UI elements to input the filename and select the file type/extension.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[396,154],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text field containing \"my_note\" (coordinates [396, 154]) to select it. This should focus the text field and allow for text input or deletion. The text field currently displays \"my_note\". Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on the text field [396, 154] (intended to select \"my_note\"), resulted in an unexpected error pop-up stating \"com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\". This pop-up now obscures part of the screen and prevents interaction with the underlying dialog. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal; instead, it introduced an interruption that needs to be handled.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Close app\" button within the error pop-up. The button is located near the text \"Close app\" (bounding box [570, 256, 591, 435]). This action is predicted to dismiss the error pop-up and allow interaction with the underlying \"Create new file\" dialog again. Actual Outcome: The last action (tapping \"Close app\" on the error pop-up) was successful. The error pop-up disappeared, and the \"Create new file\" dialog is now accessible. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by removing the obstruction.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 5: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[395,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text field containing \"my_note\" at coordinates [395, 300] to select it. This should focus the text field and allow for text input or deletion. The text field currently displays \"my_note\". The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main interface is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on the text field containing \"my_note\" at coordinates [395, 300], was successful. The text field is now focused, as indicated by the red underline beneath \"my_note\" and the appearance of the \"ADB Keyboard (ON)\" overlay. The text \"my_note\" is still present in the field, ready for editing. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating and naming the new note.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Perform a paste operation in the note and save the note.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[868,616],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon, which is currently visible in the app drawer. The icon is located near the text \\'Markor\\'. This action is predicted to launch the Markor application, moving to the next step of creating a new note. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Markor app icon successfully launched the Markor application. The screen changed from the app drawer to the Markor app\\'s main interface. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully completing the first subgoal.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[864,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the red \\'+\\' button located in the bottom right corner of the screen. This button is currently visible and is expected to open a dialog or screen for creating a new note. Actual Outcome: The last action (tapping the \\'+\\' button) was successful. It opened a dialog box for creating a new file, which is the expected behavior. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating and naming the new note. The dialog provides the necessary UI elements to input the filename and select the file type/extension.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[396,154],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text field containing \"my_note\" (coordinates [396, 154]) to select it. This should focus the text field and allow for text input or deletion. The text field currently displays \"my_note\". Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on the text field [396, 154] (intended to select \"my_note\"), resulted in an unexpected error pop-up stating \"com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\". This pop-up now obscures part of the screen and prevents interaction with the underlying dialog. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal; instead, it introduced an interruption that needs to be handled.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Close app\" button within the error pop-up. The button is located near the text \"Close app\" (bounding box [570, 256, 591, 435]). This action is predicted to dismiss the error pop-up and allow interaction with the underlying \"Create new file\" dialog again. Actual Outcome: The last action (tapping \"Close app\" on the error pop-up) was successful. The error pop-up disappeared, and the \"Create new file\" dialog is now accessible. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by removing the obstruction.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[395,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text field containing \"my_note\" at coordinates [395, 300] to select it. This should focus the text field and allow for text input or deletion. The text field currently displays \"my_note\". Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on the text field containing \"my_note\" at coordinates [395, 300], was successful. The text field is now focused, as indicated by the red underline beneath \"my_note\" and the appearance of the \"ADB Keyboard (ON)\" overlay. The text \"my_note\" is still present in the field, ready for editing. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating and naming the new note.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 6: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \"my_note\" from the focused filename text field. The text field is currently focused and contains \"my_note\". This action will clear the text field, preparing it for the new filename input. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main interface is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[864,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the red \\'+\\' button located in the bottom right corner of the screen. This button is currently visible and is expected to open a dialog or screen for creating a new note. Actual Outcome: The last action (tapping the \\'+\\' button) was successful. It opened a dialog box for creating a new file, which is the expected behavior. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating and naming the new note. The dialog provides the necessary UI elements to input the filename and select the file type/extension.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[396,154],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text field containing \"my_note\" (coordinates [396, 154]) to select it. This should focus the text field and allow for text input or deletion. The text field currently displays \"my_note\". Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on the text field [396, 154] (intended to select \"my_note\"), resulted in an unexpected error pop-up stating \"com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\". This pop-up now obscures part of the screen and prevents interaction with the underlying dialog. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal; instead, it introduced an interruption that needs to be handled.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Close app\" button within the error pop-up. The button is located near the text \"Close app\" (bounding box [570, 256, 591, 435]). This action is predicted to dismiss the error pop-up and allow interaction with the underlying \"Create new file\" dialog again. Actual Outcome: The last action (tapping \"Close app\" on the error pop-up) was successful. The error pop-up disappeared, and the \"Create new file\" dialog is now accessible. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by removing the obstruction.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[395,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text field containing \"my_note\" at coordinates [395, 300] to select it. This should focus the text field and allow for text input or deletion. The text field currently displays \"my_note\". Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on the text field containing \"my_note\" at coordinates [395, 300], was successful. The text field is now focused, as indicated by the red underline beneath \"my_note\" and the appearance of the \"ADB Keyboard (ON)\" overlay. The text \"my_note\" is still present in the field, ready for editing. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating and naming the new note.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \"my_note\" from the focused filename text field. The text field is currently focused and contains \"my_note\". This action will clear the text field, preparing it for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The last action, \"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field,\" failed to clear the text. The text \"my_note\" remains in the focused filename input field. The screen did not change. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The deletion of the text needs to be attempted again.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Perform a paste operation in the note and save the note.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[864,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the red \\'+\\' button located in the bottom right corner of the screen. This button is currently visible and is expected to open a dialog or screen for creating a new note. Actual Outcome: The last action (tapping the \\'+\\' button) was successful. It opened a dialog box for creating a new file, which is the expected behavior. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating and naming the new note. The dialog provides the necessary UI elements to input the filename and select the file type/extension.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[396,154],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text field containing \"my_note\" (coordinates [396, 154]) to select it. This should focus the text field and allow for text input or deletion. The text field currently displays \"my_note\". Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on the text field [396, 154] (intended to select \"my_note\"), resulted in an unexpected error pop-up stating \"com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\". This pop-up now obscures part of the screen and prevents interaction with the underlying dialog. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal; instead, it introduced an interruption that needs to be handled.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Close app\" button within the error pop-up. The button is located near the text \"Close app\" (bounding box [570, 256, 591, 435]). This action is predicted to dismiss the error pop-up and allow interaction with the underlying \"Create new file\" dialog again. Actual Outcome: The last action (tapping \"Close app\" on the error pop-up) was successful. The error pop-up disappeared, and the \"Create new file\" dialog is now accessible. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by removing the obstruction.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[395,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text field containing \"my_note\" at coordinates [395, 300] to select it. This should focus the text field and allow for text input or deletion. The text field currently displays \"my_note\". Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on the text field containing \"my_note\" at coordinates [395, 300], was successful. The text field is now focused, as indicated by the red underline beneath \"my_note\" and the appearance of the \"ADB Keyboard (ON)\" overlay. The text \"my_note\" is still present in the field, ready for editing. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating and naming the new note.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \"my_note\" from the focused filename text field. The text field is currently focused and contains \"my_note\". This action will clear the text field, preparing it for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The last action, \"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field,\" failed to clear the text. The text \"my_note\" remains in the focused filename input field. The screen did not change. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The deletion of the text needs to be attempted again.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 7: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Attempt to delete the text \"my_note\" from the focused filename text field again. The text field is currently focused and contains \"my_note\". This action will clear the text field, preparing it for the new filename input. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main interface is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[396,154],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text field containing \"my_note\" (coordinates [396, 154]) to select it. This should focus the text field and allow for text input or deletion. The text field currently displays \"my_note\". Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on the text field [396, 154] (intended to select \"my_note\"), resulted in an unexpected error pop-up stating \"com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\". This pop-up now obscures part of the screen and prevents interaction with the underlying dialog. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal; instead, it introduced an interruption that needs to be handled.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Close app\" button within the error pop-up. The button is located near the text \"Close app\" (bounding box [570, 256, 591, 435]). This action is predicted to dismiss the error pop-up and allow interaction with the underlying \"Create new file\" dialog again. Actual Outcome: The last action (tapping \"Close app\" on the error pop-up) was successful. The error pop-up disappeared, and the \"Create new file\" dialog is now accessible. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by removing the obstruction.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[395,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text field containing \"my_note\" at coordinates [395, 300] to select it. This should focus the text field and allow for text input or deletion. The text field currently displays \"my_note\". Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on the text field containing \"my_note\" at coordinates [395, 300], was successful. The text field is now focused, as indicated by the red underline beneath \"my_note\" and the appearance of the \"ADB Keyboard (ON)\" overlay. The text \"my_note\" is still present in the field, ready for editing. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating and naming the new note.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \"my_note\" from the focused filename text field. The text field is currently focused and contains \"my_note\". This action will clear the text field, preparing it for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The last action, \"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field,\" failed to clear the text. The text \"my_note\" remains in the focused filename input field. The screen did not change. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The deletion of the text needs to be attempted again.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Attempt to delete the text \"my_note\" from the focused filename text field again. The text field is currently focused and contains \"my_note\". This action will clear the text field, preparing it for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The last action, \"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field,\" failed. The text \"my_note\" in the focused filename input field was not deleted. The screen did not change. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The repeated failure suggests that the \\'Deletes all text\\' action is not working as expected in this scenario. A different approach, such as sending multiple backspace keyevents, is necessary to clear the text field.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing.

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Perform a paste operation in the note and save the note.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[396,154],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text field containing \"my_note\" (coordinates [396, 154]) to select it. This should focus the text field and allow for text input or deletion. The text field currently displays \"my_note\". Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on the text field [396, 154] (intended to select \"my_note\"), resulted in an unexpected error pop-up stating \"com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\". This pop-up now obscures part of the screen and prevents interaction with the underlying dialog. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal; instead, it introduced an interruption that needs to be handled.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Close app\" button within the error pop-up. The button is located near the text \"Close app\" (bounding box [570, 256, 591, 435]). This action is predicted to dismiss the error pop-up and allow interaction with the underlying \"Create new file\" dialog again. Actual Outcome: The last action (tapping \"Close app\" on the error pop-up) was successful. The error pop-up disappeared, and the \"Create new file\" dialog is now accessible. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by removing the obstruction.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[395,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text field containing \"my_note\" at coordinates [395, 300] to select it. This should focus the text field and allow for text input or deletion. The text field currently displays \"my_note\". Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on the text field containing \"my_note\" at coordinates [395, 300], was successful. The text field is now focused, as indicated by the red underline beneath \"my_note\" and the appearance of the \"ADB Keyboard (ON)\" overlay. The text \"my_note\" is still present in the field, ready for editing. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating and naming the new note.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \"my_note\" from the focused filename text field. The text field is currently focused and contains \"my_note\". This action will clear the text field, preparing it for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The last action, \"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field,\" failed to clear the text. The text \"my_note\" remains in the focused filename input field. The screen did not change. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The deletion of the text needs to be attempted again.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Attempt to delete the text \"my_note\" from the focused filename text field again. The text field is currently focused and contains \"my_note\". This action will clear the text field, preparing it for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The last action, \"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field,\" failed. The text \"my_note\" in the focused filename input field was not deleted. The screen did not change. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The repeated failure suggests that the \\'Deletes all text\\' action is not working as expected in this scenario. A different approach, such as sending multiple backspace keyevents, is necessary to clear the text field.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 8: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send 10 backspace keyevents (KEYCODE_DEL) to delete the text \"my_note\" from the focused filename text field. The text field is currently focused and contains \"my_note\". This action is predicted to clear the text field, preparing it for the new filename input.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Close app\" button within the error pop-up. The button is located near the text \"Close app\" (bounding box [570, 256, 591, 435]). This action is predicted to dismiss the error pop-up and allow interaction with the underlying \"Create new file\" dialog again. Actual Outcome: The last action (tapping \"Close app\" on the error pop-up) was successful. The error pop-up disappeared, and the \"Create new file\" dialog is now accessible. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by removing the obstruction.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[395,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text field containing \"my_note\" at coordinates [395, 300] to select it. This should focus the text field and allow for text input or deletion. The text field currently displays \"my_note\". Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on the text field containing \"my_note\" at coordinates [395, 300], was successful. The text field is now focused, as indicated by the red underline beneath \"my_note\" and the appearance of the \"ADB Keyboard (ON)\" overlay. The text \"my_note\" is still present in the field, ready for editing. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating and naming the new note.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \"my_note\" from the focused filename text field. The text field is currently focused and contains \"my_note\". This action will clear the text field, preparing it for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The last action, \"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field,\" failed to clear the text. The text \"my_note\" remains in the focused filename input field. The screen did not change. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The deletion of the text needs to be attempted again.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Attempt to delete the text \"my_note\" from the focused filename text field again. The text field is currently focused and contains \"my_note\". This action will clear the text field, preparing it for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The last action, \"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field,\" failed. The text \"my_note\" in the focused filename input field was not deleted. The screen did not change. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The repeated failure suggests that the \\'Deletes all text\\' action is not working as expected in this scenario. A different approach, such as sending multiple backspace keyevents, is necessary to clear the text field.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send 10 backspace keyevents (KEYCODE_DEL) to delete the text \"my_note\" from the focused filename text field. The text field is currently focused and contains \"my_note\". This action is predicted to clear the text field, preparing it for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The last action, sending a single KEYCODE_DEL, was unsuccessful in deleting the text \"my_note\" from the filename input field. The text remains unchanged. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To correct this, multiple backspace keyevents need to be sent to clear the existing text.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

Perform a paste operation in the note and save the note.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Close app\" button within the error pop-up. The button is located near the text \"Close app\" (bounding box [570, 256, 591, 435]). This action is predicted to dismiss the error pop-up and allow interaction with the underlying \"Create new file\" dialog again. Actual Outcome: The last action (tapping \"Close app\" on the error pop-up) was successful. The error pop-up disappeared, and the \"Create new file\" dialog is now accessible. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by removing the obstruction.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[395,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text field containing \"my_note\" at coordinates [395, 300] to select it. This should focus the text field and allow for text input or deletion. The text field currently displays \"my_note\". Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on the text field containing \"my_note\" at coordinates [395, 300], was successful. The text field is now focused, as indicated by the red underline beneath \"my_note\" and the appearance of the \"ADB Keyboard (ON)\" overlay. The text \"my_note\" is still present in the field, ready for editing. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating and naming the new note.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \"my_note\" from the focused filename text field. The text field is currently focused and contains \"my_note\". This action will clear the text field, preparing it for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The last action, \"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field,\" failed to clear the text. The text \"my_note\" remains in the focused filename input field. The screen did not change. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The deletion of the text needs to be attempted again.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Attempt to delete the text \"my_note\" from the focused filename text field again. The text field is currently focused and contains \"my_note\". This action will clear the text field, preparing it for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The last action, \"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field,\" failed. The text \"my_note\" in the focused filename input field was not deleted. The screen did not change. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The repeated failure suggests that the \\'Deletes all text\\' action is not working as expected in this scenario. A different approach, such as sending multiple backspace keyevents, is necessary to clear the text field.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send 10 backspace keyevents (KEYCODE_DEL) to delete the text \"my_note\" from the focused filename text field. The text field is currently focused and contains \"my_note\". This action is predicted to clear the text field, preparing it for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The last action, sending a single KEYCODE_DEL, was unsuccessful in deleting the text \"my_note\" from the filename input field. The text remains unchanged.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[395,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text field containing \"my_note\" at coordinates [395, 300] to select it. This should focus the text field and allow for text input or deletion. The text field currently displays \"my_note\". Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on the text field containing \"my_note\" at coordinates [395, 300], was successful. The text field is now focused, as indicated by the red underline beneath \"my_note\" and the appearance of the \"ADB Keyboard (ON)\" overlay. The text \"my_note\" is still present in the field, ready for editing. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating and naming the new note.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \"my_note\" from the focused filename text field. The text field is currently focused and contains \"my_note\". This action will clear the text field, preparing it for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The last action, \"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field,\" failed to clear the text. The text \"my_note\" remains in the focused filename input field. The screen did not change. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The deletion of the text needs to be attempted again.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Attempt to delete the text \"my_note\" from the focused filename text field again. The text field is currently focused and contains \"my_note\". This action will clear the text field, preparing it for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The last action, \"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field,\" failed. The text \"my_note\" in the focused filename input field was not deleted. The screen did not change. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The repeated failure suggests that the \\'Deletes all text\\' action is not working as expected in this scenario. A different approach, such as sending multiple backspace keyevents, is necessary to clear the text field.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send 10 backspace keyevents (KEYCODE_DEL) to delete the text \"my_note\" from the focused filename text field. The text field is currently focused and contains \"my_note\". This action is predicted to clear the text field, preparing it for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The last action, sending a single KEYCODE_DEL, was unsuccessful in deleting the text \"my_note\" from the filename input field. The text remains unchanged. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To correct this, multiple backspace keyevents need to be sent to clear the existing text.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send 10 KEYCODE_DEL keyevents to delete the text \"my_note\" from the focused filename text field. The text field is currently focused and contains \"my_note\". This action is predicted to clear the text field, preparing it for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The last action, sending a single KEYCODE_DEL event, was unsuccessful. The text \"my_note\" in the focused filename input field was not deleted. The screen did not change significantly. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The repeated failure to delete the text indicates a persistent issue, possibly with how deletion actions are being executed (e.g., sending only one keyevent when multiple are intended). The next attempt to delete the text must ensure multiple backspace keyevents are sent.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 10: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevent to attempt to delete one character from the end of the text \"my_note\" in the focused filename input field. The field is currently focused and contains \"my_note\". If successful, the text should become \"my_not\". If it fails, the text will remain \"my_note\". The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main interface is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Perform a paste operation in the note and save the note.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \"my_note\" from the focused filename text field. The text field is currently focused and contains \"my_note\". This action will clear the text field, preparing it for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The last action, \"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field,\" failed to clear the text. The text \"my_note\" remains in the focused filename input field. The screen did not change. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The deletion of the text needs to be attempted again.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Attempt to delete the text \"my_note\" from the focused filename text field again. The text field is currently focused and contains \"my_note\". This action will clear the text field, preparing it for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The last action, \"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field,\" failed. The text \"my_note\" in the focused filename input field was not deleted. The screen did not change. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The repeated failure suggests that the \\'Deletes all text\\' action is not working as expected in this scenario. A different approach, such as sending multiple backspace keyevents, is necessary to clear the text field.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send 10 backspace keyevents (KEYCODE_DEL) to delete the text \"my_note\" from the focused filename text field. The text field is currently focused and contains \"my_note\". This action is predicted to clear the text field, preparing it for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The last action, sending a single KEYCODE_DEL, was unsuccessful in deleting the text \"my_note\" from the filename input field. The text remains unchanged. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To correct this, multiple backspace keyevents need to be sent to clear the existing text.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send 10 KEYCODE_DEL keyevents to delete the text \"my_note\" from the focused filename text field. The text field is currently focused and contains \"my_note\". This action is predicted to clear the text field, preparing it for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The last action, sending a single KEYCODE_DEL event, was unsuccessful. The text \"my_note\" in the focused filename input field was not deleted. The screen did not change significantly. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The repeated failure to delete the text indicates a persistent issue, possibly with how deletion actions are being executed (e.g., sending only one keyevent when multiple are intended). The next attempt to delete the text must ensure multiple backspace keyevents are sent.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevent to attempt to delete one character from the end of the text \"my_note\" in the focused filename input field. The field is currently focused and contains \"my_note\". If successful, the text should become \"my_not\". If it fails, the text will remain \"my_note\". Actual Outcome: The last action, sending a single `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevent, was unsuccessful. The text \"my_note\" in the focused filename input field was not deleted or altered. The screen shows no significant changes resulting from the action. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The repeated failure to delete text with single `KEYCODE_DEL` events, despite the plan to send multiple, highlights an issue with the execution of the deletion strategy. The next attempt must ensure that multiple backspace keyevents are sent to clear the existing text.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 11: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[372,374],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the center of the focused text field that currently contains \"my_note\". The text field has bounds [355, 84, 389, 663], so the center is approximately [372, 374]. This action is intended to bring up a context menu with text editing options like \"Select All\", which can then be used to delete the existing text. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main interface is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Attempt to delete the text \"my_note\" from the focused filename text field again. The text field is currently focused and contains \"my_note\". This action will clear the text field, preparing it for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The last action, \"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field,\" failed. The text \"my_note\" in the focused filename input field was not deleted. The screen did not change. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The repeated failure suggests that the \\'Deletes all text\\' action is not working as expected in this scenario. A different approach, such as sending multiple backspace keyevents, is necessary to clear the text field.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send 10 backspace keyevents (KEYCODE_DEL) to delete the text \"my_note\" from the focused filename text field. The text field is currently focused and contains \"my_note\". This action is predicted to clear the text field, preparing it for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The last action, sending a single KEYCODE_DEL, was unsuccessful in deleting the text \"my_note\" from the filename input field. The text remains unchanged. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To correct this, multiple backspace keyevents need to be sent to clear the existing text.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send 10 KEYCODE_DEL keyevents to delete the text \"my_note\" from the focused filename text field. The text field is currently focused and contains \"my_note\". This action is predicted to clear the text field, preparing it for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The last action, sending a single KEYCODE_DEL event, was unsuccessful. The text \"my_note\" in the focused filename input field was not deleted. The screen did not change significantly. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The repeated failure to delete the text indicates a persistent issue, possibly with how deletion actions are being executed (e.g., sending only one keyevent when multiple are intended). The next attempt to delete the text must ensure multiple backspace keyevents are sent.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevent to attempt to delete one character from the end of the text \"my_note\" in the focused filename input field. The field is currently focused and contains \"my_note\". If successful, the text should become \"my_not\". If it fails, the text will remain \"my_note\". Actual Outcome: The last action, sending a single `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevent, was unsuccessful. The text \"my_note\" in the focused filename input field was not deleted or altered. The screen shows no significant changes resulting from the action. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The repeated failure to delete text with single `KEYCODE_DEL` events, despite the plan to send multiple, highlights an issue with the execution of the deletion strategy. The next attempt must ensure that multiple backspace keyevents are sent to clear the existing text.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[372,374],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the center of the focused text field that currently contains \"my_note\". The text field has bounds [355, 84, 389, 663], so the center is approximately [372, 374]. This action is intended to bring up a context menu with text editing options like \"Select All\", which can then be used to delete the existing text. Actual Outcome: The long_press action was successful. It brought up a context menu above the focused text field, which includes a \"Paste\" option and a three-dot menu icon. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal because it provides a new way to manipulate the text in the field, which is necessary since previous deletion methods failed.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Perform a paste operation in the note and save the note.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Attempt to delete the text \"my_note\" from the focused filename text field again. The text field is currently focused and contains \"my_note\". This action will clear the text field, preparing it for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The last action, \"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field,\" failed. The text \"my_note\" in the focused filename input field was not deleted. The screen did not change. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The repeated failure suggests that the \\'Deletes all text\\' action is not working as expected in this scenario. A different approach, such as sending multiple backspace keyevents, is necessary to clear the text field.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send 10 backspace keyevents (KEYCODE_DEL) to delete the text \"my_note\" from the focused filename text field. The text field is currently focused and contains \"my_note\". This action is predicted to clear the text field, preparing it for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The last action, sending a single KEYCODE_DEL, was unsuccessful in deleting the text \"my_note\" from the filename input field. The text remains unchanged. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To correct this, multiple backspace keyevents need to be sent to clear the existing text.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send 10 KEYCODE_DEL keyevents to delete the text \"my_note\" from the focused filename text field. The text field is currently focused and contains \"my_note\". This action is predicted to clear the text field, preparing it for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The last action, sending a single KEYCODE_DEL event, was unsuccessful. The text \"my_note\" in the focused filename input field was not deleted. The screen did not change significantly. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The repeated failure to delete the text indicates a persistent issue, possibly with how deletion actions are being executed (e.g., sending only one keyevent when multiple are intended). The next attempt to delete the text must ensure multiple backspace keyevents are sent.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevent to attempt to delete one character from the end of the text \"my_note\" in the focused filename input field. The field is currently focused and contains \"my_note\". If successful, the text should become \"my_not\". If it fails, the text will remain \"my_note\". Actual Outcome: The last action, sending a single `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevent, was unsuccessful. The text \"my_note\" in the focused filename input field was not deleted or altered. The screen shows no significant changes resulting from the action. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The repeated failure to delete text with single `KEYCODE_DEL` events, despite the plan to send multiple, highlights an issue with the execution of the deletion strategy. The next attempt must ensure that multiple backspace keyevents are sent to clear the existing text.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[372,374],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the center of the focused text field that currently contains \"my_note\". The text field has bounds [355, 84, 389, 663], so the center is approximately [372, 374]. This action is intended to bring up a context menu with text editing options like \"Select All\", which can then be used to delete the existing text. Actual Outcome: The long_press action was successful. It brought up a context menu above the focused text field, which includes a \"Paste\" option and a three-dot menu icon. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal because it provides a new way to manipulate the text in the field, which is necessary since previous deletion methods failed.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 12: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[405,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located to the right of the \"Paste\" option in the context menu. The context menu is currently visible above the filename input field. This action is expected to open a sub-menu with more text editing options, such as \"Select All\". The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main interface is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text field is currently focused and contains \"my_note\". This action is predicted to clear the text field, preparing it for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The last action, sending a single KEYCODE_DEL, was unsuccessful in deleting the text \"my_note\" from the filename input field. The text remains unchanged. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To correct this, multiple backspace keyevents need to be sent to clear the existing text.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send 10 KEYCODE_DEL keyevents to delete the text \"my_note\" from the focused filename text field. The text field is currently focused and contains \"my_note\". This action is predicted to clear the text field, preparing it for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The last action, sending a single KEYCODE_DEL event, was unsuccessful. The text \"my_note\" in the focused filename input field was not deleted. The screen did not change significantly. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The repeated failure to delete the text indicates a persistent issue, possibly with how deletion actions are being executed (e.g., sending only one keyevent when multiple are intended). The next attempt to delete the text must ensure multiple backspace keyevents are sent.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevent to attempt to delete one character from the end of the text \"my_note\" in the focused filename input field. The field is currently focused and contains \"my_note\". If successful, the text should become \"my_not\". If it fails, the text will remain \"my_note\". Actual Outcome: The last action, sending a single `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevent, was unsuccessful. The text \"my_note\" in the focused filename input field was not deleted or altered. The screen shows no significant changes resulting from the action. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The repeated failure to delete text with single `KEYCODE_DEL` events, despite the plan to send multiple, highlights an issue with the execution of the deletion strategy. The next attempt must ensure that multiple backspace keyevents are sent to clear the existing text.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[372,374],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the center of the focused text field that currently contains \"my_note\". The text field has bounds [355, 84, 389, 663], so the center is approximately [372, 374]. This action is intended to bring up a context menu with text editing options like \"Select All\", which can then be used to delete the existing text. Actual Outcome: The long_press action was successful. It brought up a context menu above the focused text field, which includes a \"Paste\" option and a three-dot menu icon. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal because it provides a new way to manipulate the text in the field, which is necessary since previous deletion methods failed.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[405,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located to the right of the \"Paste\" option in the context menu. The context menu is currently visible above the filename input field. This action is expected to open a sub-menu with more text editing options, such as \"Select All\". Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping the three-dot menu icon in the context menu, successfully opened a new context menu. This new menu shows \"Autofill\" and a back arrow icon. However, it does not contain the anticipated \"Select All\" option, which was the reason for tapping the three-dot icon. Thus, while the action itself was executed, it did not directly lead to the desired state for text deletion. The agent needs to navigate back from this \"Autofill\" menu to continue trying to delete the text.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text field is currently focused and contains \"my_note\". This action is predicted to clear the text field, preparing it for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The last action, sending a single KEYCODE_DEL, was unsuccessful in deleting the text \"my_note\" from the filename input field. The text remains unchanged. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To correct this, multiple backspace keyevents need to be sent to clear the existing text.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send 10 KEYCODE_DEL keyevents to delete the text \"my_note\" from the focused filename text field. The text field is currently focused and contains \"my_note\". This action is predicted to clear the text field, preparing it for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The last action, sending a single KEYCODE_DEL event, was unsuccessful. The text \"my_note\" in the focused filename input field was not deleted. The screen did not change significantly. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The repeated failure to delete the text indicates a persistent issue, possibly with how deletion actions are being executed (e.g., sending only one keyevent when multiple are intended).

The field is currently focused and contains \"my_note\". If successful, the text should become \"my_not\". If it fails, the text will remain \"my_note\". Actual Outcome: The last action, sending a single `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevent, was unsuccessful. The text \"my_note\" in the focused filename input field was not deleted or altered. The screen shows no significant changes resulting from the action. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The repeated failure to delete text with single `KEYCODE_DEL` events, despite the plan to send multiple, highlights an issue with the execution of the deletion strategy. The next attempt must ensure that multiple backspace keyevents are sent to clear the existing text.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[372,374],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the center of the focused text field that currently contains \"my_note\". The text field has bounds [355, 84, 389, 663], so the center is approximately [372, 374]. This action is intended to bring up a context menu with text editing options like \"Select All\", which can then be used to delete the existing text. Actual Outcome: The long_press action was successful. It brought up a context menu above the focused text field, which includes a \"Paste\" option and a three-dot menu icon. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal because it provides a new way to manipulate the text in the field, which is necessary since previous deletion methods failed.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[405,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located to the right of the \"Paste\" option in the context menu. The context menu is currently visible above the filename input field. This action is expected to open a sub-menu with more text editing options, such as \"Select All\". Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping the three-dot menu icon in the context menu, successfully opened a new context menu. This new menu shows \"Autofill\" and a back arrow icon. However, it does not contain the anticipated \"Select All\" option, which was the reason for tapping the three-dot icon. Thus, while the action itself was executed, it did not directly lead to the desired state for text deletion. The agent needs to navigate back from this \"Autofill\" menu to continue trying to delete the text.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 13: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[405,150],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon in the \"Autofill\" context menu. The \"Autofill\" context menu is currently displayed above the filename input field. This action is predicted to close the \"Autofill\" menu and return to the previous context menu, which hopefully contains a \"Select All\" option.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Perform a paste operation in the note and save the note.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send 10 KEYCODE_DEL keyevents to delete the text \"my_note\" from the focused filename text field. The text field is currently focused and contains \"my_note\". This action is predicted to clear the text field, preparing it for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The last action, sending a single KEYCODE_DEL event, was unsuccessful. The text \"my_note\" in the focused filename input field was not deleted. The screen did not change significantly. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The repeated failure to delete the text indicates a persistent issue, possibly with how deletion actions are being executed (e.g., sending only one keyevent when multiple are intended). The next attempt to delete the text must ensure multiple backspace keyevents are sent.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevent to attempt to delete one character from the end of the text \"my_note\" in the focused filename input field. The field is currently focused and contains \"my_note\". If successful, the text should become \"my_not\". If it fails, the text will remain \"my_note\". Actual Outcome: The last action, sending a single `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevent, was unsuccessful. The text \"my_note\" in the focused filename input field was not deleted or altered. The screen shows no significant changes resulting from the action. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The repeated failure to delete text with single `KEYCODE_DEL` events, despite the plan to send multiple, highlights an issue with the execution of the deletion strategy. The next attempt must ensure that multiple backspace keyevents are sent to clear the existing text.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[372,374],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the center of the focused text field that currently contains \"my_note\". The text field has bounds [355, 84, 389, 663], so the center is approximately [372, 374]. This action is intended to bring up a context menu with text editing options like \"Select All\", which can then be used to delete the existing text. Actual Outcome: The long_press action was successful. It brought up a context menu above the focused text field, which includes a \"Paste\" option and a three-dot menu icon. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal because it provides a new way to manipulate the text in the field, which is necessary since previous deletion methods failed.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[405,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located to the right of the \"Paste\" option in the context menu. The context menu is currently visible above the filename input field. This action is expected to open a sub-menu with more text editing options, such as \"Select All\". Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping the three-dot menu icon in the context menu, successfully opened a new context menu. This new menu shows \"Autofill\" and a back arrow icon. However, it does not contain the anticipated \"Select All\" option, which was the reason for tapping the three-dot icon. Thus, while the action itself was executed, it did not directly lead to the desired state for text deletion. The agent needs to navigate back from this \"Autofill\" menu to continue trying to delete the text.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[405,150],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon in the \"Autofill\" context menu. The \"Autofill\" context menu is currently displayed above the filename input field. This action is predicted to close the \"Autofill\" menu and return to the previous context menu, which hopefully contains a \"Select All\" option. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping the back arrow icon at [405,150] in the \"Autofill\" context menu, successfully closed the \"Autofill\" menu. The screen now shows the previous context menu with \"Paste\" and a three-dot menu icon above the filename input field. This action brought the agent back to a state where it can attempt alternative methods for text deletion, thus moving closer to completing the active subgoal, albeit indirectly, by undoing the previous step that didn\\'t lead to the desired \"Select All\" option.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 14: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[486,174],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \"Template Empty file\" (center at [486, 174]) to dismiss the currently open context menu (which shows \"Paste\" and a three-dot icon). This action is predicted to close the context menu, allowing further interaction with the filename text field. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main interface is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The field is currently focused and contains \"my_note\". If successful, the text should become \"my_not\". If it fails, the text will remain \"my_note\". Actual Outcome: The last action, sending a single `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevent, was unsuccessful. The text \"my_note\" in the focused filename input field was not deleted or altered. The screen shows no significant changes resulting from the action. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The repeated failure to delete text with single `KEYCODE_DEL` events, despite the plan to send multiple, highlights an issue with the execution of the deletion strategy. The next attempt must ensure that multiple backspace keyevents are sent to clear the existing text.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[372,374],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the center of the focused text field that currently contains \"my_note\". The text field has bounds [355, 84, 389, 663], so the center is approximately [372, 374]. This action is intended to bring up a context menu with text editing options like \"Select All\", which can then be used to delete the existing text. Actual Outcome: The long_press action was successful. It brought up a context menu above the focused text field, which includes a \"Paste\" option and a three-dot menu icon. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal because it provides a new way to manipulate the text in the field, which is necessary since previous deletion methods failed.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[405,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located to the right of the \"Paste\" option in the context menu. The context menu is currently visible above the filename input field. This action is expected to open a sub-menu with more text editing options, such as \"Select All\". Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping the three-dot menu icon in the context menu, successfully opened a new context menu. This new menu shows \"Autofill\" and a back arrow icon. However, it does not contain the anticipated \"Select All\" option, which was the reason for tapping the three-dot icon. Thus, while the action itself was executed, it did not directly lead to the desired state for text deletion. The agent needs to navigate back from this \"Autofill\" menu to continue trying to delete the text.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[405,150],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon in the \"Autofill\" context menu. The \"Autofill\" context menu is currently displayed above the filename input field. This action is predicted to close the \"Autofill\" menu and return to the previous context menu, which hopefully contains a \"Select All\" option. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping the back arrow icon at [405,150] in the \"Autofill\" context menu, successfully closed the \"Autofill\" menu. The screen now shows the previous context menu with \"Paste\" and a three-dot menu icon above the filename input field. This action brought the agent back to a state where it can attempt alternative methods for text deletion, thus moving closer to completing the active subgoal, albeit indirectly, by undoing the previous step that didn\\'t lead to the desired \"Select All\" option.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[486,174],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \"Template Empty file\" (center at [486, 174]) to dismiss the currently open context menu (which shows \"Paste\" and a three-dot icon). This action is predicted to close the context menu, allowing further interaction with the filename text field. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on \"Template Empty file\" at [486, 174], did not dismiss the context menu as intended. Instead, it opened a dropdown list of templates. The context menu is no longer visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal because it introduced a new UI element (the template dropdown) that needs to be dismissed before proceeding with renaming the file. The next step should be to close the template dropdown.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Perform a paste operation in the note and save the note.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevent to attempt to delete one character from the end of the text \"my_note\" in the focused filename input field. The field is currently focused and contains \"my_note\". If successful, the text should become \"my_not\". If it fails, the text will remain \"my_note\". Actual Outcome: The last action, sending a single `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevent, was unsuccessful. The text \"my_note\" in the focused filename input field was not deleted or altered. The screen shows no significant changes resulting from the action. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The repeated failure to delete text with single `KEYCODE_DEL` events, despite the plan to send multiple, highlights an issue with the execution of the deletion strategy. The next attempt must ensure that multiple backspace keyevents are sent to clear the existing text.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[372,374],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the center of the focused text field that currently contains \"my_note\". The text field has bounds [355, 84, 389, 663], so the center is approximately [372, 374]. This action is intended to bring up a context menu with text editing options like \"Select All\", which can then be used to delete the existing text. Actual Outcome: The long_press action was successful. It brought up a context menu above the focused text field, which includes a \"Paste\" option and a three-dot menu icon. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal because it provides a new way to manipulate the text in the field, which is necessary since previous deletion methods failed.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[405,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located to the right of the \"Paste\" option in the context menu. The context menu is currently visible above the filename input field. This action is expected to open a sub-menu with more text editing options, such as \"Select All\". Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping the three-dot menu icon in the context menu, successfully opened a new context menu. This new menu shows \"Autofill\" and a back arrow icon. However, it does not contain the anticipated \"Select All\" option, which was the reason for tapping the three-dot icon. Thus, while the action itself was executed, it did not directly lead to the desired state for text deletion. The agent needs to navigate back from this \"Autofill\" menu to continue trying to delete the text.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[405,150],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon in the \"Autofill\" context menu. The \"Autofill\" context menu is currently displayed above the filename input field. This action is predicted to close the \"Autofill\" menu and return to the previous context menu, which hopefully contains a \"Select All\" option. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping the back arrow icon at [405,150] in the \"Autofill\" context menu, successfully closed the \"Autofill\" menu. The screen now shows the previous context menu with \"Paste\" and a three-dot menu icon above the filename input field. This action brought the agent back to a state where it can attempt alternative methods for text deletion, thus moving closer to completing the active subgoal, albeit indirectly, by undoing the previous step that didn\\'t lead to the desired \"Select All\" option.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[486,174],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \"Template Empty file\" (center at [486, 174]) to dismiss the currently open context menu (which shows \"Paste\" and a three-dot icon). This action is predicted to close the context menu, allowing further interaction with the filename text field. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on \"Template Empty file\" at [486, 174], did not dismiss the context menu as intended. Instead, it opened a dropdown list of templates. The context menu is no longer visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal because it introduced a new UI element (the template dropdown) that needs to be dismissed before proceeding with renaming the file. The next step should be to close the template dropdown.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 15: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[372,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Name\" input field, specifically on the text \"my_note\" (estimated center at [372, 153]). This field currently contains \"my_note\". This action is intended to close the template selection dropdown that was opened in the previous step and to focus the filename input field. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main interface is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[372,374],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the center of the focused text field that currently contains \"my_note\". The text field has bounds [355, 84, 389, 663], so the center is approximately [372, 374]. This action is intended to bring up a context menu with text editing options like \"Select All\", which can then be used to delete the existing text. Actual Outcome: The long_press action was successful. It brought up a context menu above the focused text field, which includes a \"Paste\" option and a three-dot menu icon. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal because it provides a new way to manipulate the text in the field, which is necessary since previous deletion methods failed.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[405,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located to the right of the \"Paste\" option in the context menu. The context menu is currently visible above the filename input field. This action is expected to open a sub-menu with more text editing options, such as \"Select All\". Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping the three-dot menu icon in the context menu, successfully opened a new context menu. This new menu shows \"Autofill\" and a back arrow icon. However, it does not contain the anticipated \"Select All\" option, which was the reason for tapping the three-dot icon. Thus, while the action itself was executed, it did not directly lead to the desired state for text deletion. The agent needs to navigate back from this \"Autofill\" menu to continue trying to delete the text.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[405,150],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon in the \"Autofill\" context menu. The \"Autofill\" context menu is currently displayed above the filename input field. This action is predicted to close the \"Autofill\" menu and return to the previous context menu, which hopefully contains a \"Select All\" option. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping the back arrow icon at [405,150] in the \"Autofill\" context menu, successfully closed the \"Autofill\" menu. The screen now shows the previous context menu with \"Paste\" and a three-dot menu icon above the filename input field. This action brought the agent back to a state where it can attempt alternative methods for text deletion, thus moving closer to completing the active subgoal, albeit indirectly, by undoing the previous step that didn\\'t lead to the desired \"Select All\" option.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[486,174],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \"Template Empty file\" (center at [486, 174]) to dismiss the currently open context menu (which shows \"Paste\" and a three-dot icon). This action is predicted to close the context menu, allowing further interaction with the filename text field. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on \"Template Empty file\" at [486, 174], did not dismiss the context menu as intended. Instead, it opened a dropdown list of templates. The context menu is no longer visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal because it introduced a new UI element (the template dropdown) that needs to be dismissed before proceeding with renaming the file. The next step should be to close the template dropdown.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[372,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Name\" input field, specifically on the text \"my_note\" (estimated center at [372, 153]). This field currently contains \"my_note\". This action is intended to close the template selection dropdown that was opened in the previous step and to focus the filename input field. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Name\\' input field at [372, 153] was successful. It closed the template selection dropdown that was previously open. The \\'Name\\' field containing \\'my_note\\' remains focused, which is the desired state for the next step of deleting the text. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by restoring the UI to a state where text input and modification are possible.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Perform a paste operation in the note and save the note.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[372,374],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the center of the focused text field that currently contains \"my_note\". The text field has bounds [355, 84, 389, 663], so the center is approximately [372, 374]. This action is intended to bring up a context menu with text editing options like \"Select All\", which can then be used to delete the existing text. Actual Outcome: The long_press action was successful. It brought up a context menu above the focused text field, which includes a \"Paste\" option and a three-dot menu icon. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal because it provides a new way to manipulate the text in the field, which is necessary since previous deletion methods failed.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[405,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located to the right of the \"Paste\" option in the context menu. The context menu is currently visible above the filename input field. This action is expected to open a sub-menu with more text editing options, such as \"Select All\". Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping the three-dot menu icon in the context menu, successfully opened a new context menu. This new menu shows \"Autofill\" and a back arrow icon. However, it does not contain the anticipated \"Select All\" option, which was the reason for tapping the three-dot icon. Thus, while the action itself was executed, it did not directly lead to the desired state for text deletion. The agent needs to navigate back from this \"Autofill\" menu to continue trying to delete the text.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

The \"Autofill\" context menu is currently displayed above the filename input field. This action is predicted to close the \"Autofill\" menu and return to the previous context menu, which hopefully contains a \"Select All\" option. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping the back arrow icon at [405,150] in the \"Autofill\" context menu, successfully closed the \"Autofill\" menu. The screen now shows the previous context menu with \"Paste\" and a three-dot menu icon above the filename input field. This action brought the agent back to a state where it can attempt alternative methods for text deletion, thus moving closer to completing the active subgoal, albeit indirectly, by undoing the previous step that didn\\'t lead to the desired \"Select All\" option.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[486,174],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \"Template Empty file\" (center at [486, 174]) to dismiss the currently open context menu (which shows \"Paste\" and a three-dot icon). This action is predicted to close the context menu, allowing further interaction with the filename text field. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on \"Template Empty file\" at [486, 174], did not dismiss the context menu as intended. Instead, it opened a dropdown list of templates. The context menu is no longer visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal because it introduced a new UI element (the template dropdown) that needs to be dismissed before proceeding with renaming the file. The next step should be to close the template dropdown.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[372,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Name\" input field, specifically on the text \"my_note\" (estimated center at [372, 153]). This field currently contains \"my_note\". This action is intended to close the template selection dropdown that was opened in the previous step and to focus the filename input field. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Name\\' input field at [372, 153] was successful. It closed the template selection dropdown that was previously open. The \\'Name\\' field containing \\'my_note\\' remains focused, which is the desired state for the next step of deleting the text.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This transformation is unusual for a single KEYCODE_DEL event if it were a simple character deletion (e.g., deleting 'm' from 'my_note' should yield 'y_note'). The XML data provided for 'Screen Information Text After the Action' still indicates the text field contains 'my_note', which conflicts with the visual observation from the screenshot. This suggests a potential desynchronization between the UI's visual state and the underlying accessibility data, or an OCR misinterpretation of the visual, or an unexpected side-effect of the KEYCODE_DEL.\\nDespite this peculiarity, the current plan is to clear the field by sending multiple KEYCODE_DEL events. One such event has been executed. Assuming the visual change to 'hy_note' (7 characters) is accurate and KEYCODE_DEL removes characters (likely from the beginning, based on the 'm' being affected in the initial interpretation), continuing this approach should eventually clear the field. The original plan to send approximately 10 DEL events (9 more after this first one) should be sufficient.\\nThe active subgoal is 'Create and Name New Note', and the immediate task is to clear the existing filename.

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Perform a paste operation in the note and save the note.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[405,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located to the right of the \"Paste\" option in the context menu. The context menu is currently visible above the filename input field. This action is expected to open a sub-menu with more text editing options, such as \"Select All\". Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping the three-dot menu icon in the context menu, successfully opened a new context menu. This new menu shows \"Autofill\" and a back arrow icon. However, it does not contain the anticipated \"Select All\" option, which was the reason for tapping the three-dot icon. Thus, while the action itself was executed, it did not directly lead to the desired state for text deletion. The agent needs to navigate back from this \"Autofill\" menu to continue trying to delete the text.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[405,150],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon in the \"Autofill\" context menu. The \"Autofill\" context menu is currently displayed above the filename input field. This action is predicted to close the \"Autofill\" menu and return to the previous context menu, which hopefully contains a \"Select All\" option. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping the back arrow icon at [405,150] in the \"Autofill\" context menu, successfully closed the \"Autofill\" menu. The screen now shows the previous context menu with \"Paste\" and a three-dot menu icon above the filename input field. This action brought the agent back to a state where it can attempt alternative methods for text deletion, thus moving closer to completing the active subgoal, albeit indirectly, by undoing the previous step that didn\\'t lead to the desired \"Select All\" option.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[486,174],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \"Template Empty file\" (center at [486, 174]) to dismiss the currently open context menu (which shows \"Paste\" and a three-dot icon). This action is predicted to close the context menu, allowing further interaction with the filename text field. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on \"Template Empty file\" at [486, 174], did not dismiss the context menu as intended. Instead, it opened a dropdown list of templates. The context menu is no longer visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal because it introduced a new UI element (the template dropdown) that needs to be dismissed before proceeding with renaming the file. The next step should be to close the template dropdown.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[372,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Name\" input field, specifically on the text \"my_note\" (estimated center at [372, 153]). This field currently contains \"my_note\". This action is intended to close the template selection dropdown that was opened in the previous step and to focus the filename input field. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Name\\' input field at [372, 153] was successful. It closed the template selection dropdown that was previously open. The \\'Name\\' field containing \\'my_note\\' remains focused, which is the desired state for the next step of deleting the text. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by restoring the UI to a state where text input and modification are possible.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"67\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a KEYCODE_DEL (67) event to delete one character from the focused \\'Name\\' text field, which currently contains \\'my_note\\'. This is the first of 10 planned DEL events to clear the field. The field is expected to contain \\'my_not\\' after this action. Actual Outcome: The last action was `adb shell input keyevent 67` (KEYCODE_DEL). Before this action, the \\'Name\\' text field visually contained \\'my_note\\'. After the action, the screenshot shows the text in this field as \\'hy_note\\'. This change is unexpected for a standard KEYCODE_DEL operation if it simply deleted one character. The text field remains focused. While a modification to the text occurred, the precise nature of the KEYCODE_DEL\\'s effect is unclear due to the \\'my_note\\' to \\'hy_note\\' change and the conflicting XML data (which still reports \\'my_note\\'). However, an attempt to modify the text was made. The action moves towards clearing the field, assuming subsequent DEL events will continue to remove characters.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 17: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"67\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send another KEYCODE_DEL (67) event to delete one more character from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. Visually, the field contains \\'hy_note\\'. According to XML, it contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is part of the plan to clear the field before entering the new filename. The field is expected to contain \\'hy_not\\' or \\'y_note\\' or some other shortened version after this action, depending on how the DEL key is interpreted. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main interface is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[405,150],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon in the \"Autofill\" context menu. The \"Autofill\" context menu is currently displayed above the filename input field. This action is predicted to close the \"Autofill\" menu and return to the previous context menu, which hopefully contains a \"Select All\" option. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping the back arrow icon at [405,150] in the \"Autofill\" context menu, successfully closed the \"Autofill\" menu. The screen now shows the previous context menu with \"Paste\" and a three-dot menu icon above the filename input field. This action brought the agent back to a state where it can attempt alternative methods for text deletion, thus moving closer to completing the active subgoal, albeit indirectly, by undoing the previous step that didn\\'t lead to the desired \"Select All\" option.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[486,174],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \"Template Empty file\" (center at [486, 174]) to dismiss the currently open context menu (which shows \"Paste\" and a three-dot icon). This action is predicted to close the context menu, allowing further interaction with the filename text field. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on \"Template Empty file\" at [486, 174], did not dismiss the context menu as intended. Instead, it opened a dropdown list of templates. The context menu is no longer visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal because it introduced a new UI element (the template dropdown) that needs to be dismissed before proceeding with renaming the file. The next step should be to close the template dropdown.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[372,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Name\" input field, specifically on the text \"my_note\" (estimated center at [372, 153]). This field currently contains \"my_note\". This action is intended to close the template selection dropdown that was opened in the previous step and to focus the filename input field. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Name\\' input field at [372, 153] was successful. It closed the template selection dropdown that was previously open. The \\'Name\\' field containing \\'my_note\\' remains focused, which is the desired state for the next step of deleting the text. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by restoring the UI to a state where text input and modification are possible.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"67\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a KEYCODE_DEL (67) event to delete one character from the focused \\'Name\\' text field, which currently contains \\'my_note\\'. This is the first of 10 planned DEL events to clear the field. The field is expected to contain \\'my_not\\' after this action. Actual Outcome: The last action was `adb shell input keyevent 67` (KEYCODE_DEL). Before this action, the \\'Name\\' text field visually contained \\'my_note\\'. After the action, the screenshot shows the text in this field as \\'hy_note\\'. This change is unexpected for a standard KEYCODE_DEL operation if it simply deleted one character. The text field remains focused. While a modification to the text occurred, the precise nature of the KEYCODE_DEL\\'s effect is unclear due to the \\'my_note\\' to \\'hy_note\\' change and the conflicting XML data (which still reports \\'my_note\\'). However, an attempt to modify the text was made. The action moves towards clearing the field, assuming subsequent DEL events will continue to remove characters.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"67\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send another KEYCODE_DEL (67) event to delete one more character from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. Visually, the field contains \\'hy_note\\'. According to XML, it contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is part of the plan to clear the field before entering the new filename. The field is expected to contain \\'hy_not\\' or \\'y_note\\' or some other shortened version after this action, depending on how the DEL key is interpreted. Actual Outcome: The last action, sending a KEYCODE_DEL (67) event, failed to modify the text in the \\'Name\\' input field. Visually, the field still shows \\'hy_note\\', and the XML data reports the content as \\'my_note\\'. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the text was not deleted. The next step will be to try the \\'delete\\' action to clear the text field.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Perform a paste operation in the note and save the note.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[405,150],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon in the \"Autofill\" context menu. The \"Autofill\" context menu is currently displayed above the filename input field. This action is predicted to close the \"Autofill\" menu and return to the previous context menu, which hopefully contains a \"Select All\" option. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping the back arrow icon at [405,150] in the \"Autofill\" context menu, successfully closed the \"Autofill\" menu. The screen now shows the previous context menu with \"Paste\" and a three-dot menu icon above the filename input field. This action brought the agent back to a state where it can attempt alternative methods for text deletion, thus moving closer to completing the active subgoal, albeit indirectly, by undoing the previous step that didn\\'t lead to the desired \"Select All\" option.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[486,174],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \"Template Empty file\" (center at [486, 174]) to dismiss the currently open context menu (which shows \"Paste\" and a three-dot icon). This action is predicted to close the context menu, allowing further interaction with the filename text field. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on \"Template Empty file\" at [486, 174], did not dismiss the context menu as intended. Instead, it opened a dropdown list of templates. The context menu is no longer visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal because it introduced a new UI element (the template dropdown) that needs to be dismissed before proceeding with renaming the file. The next step should be to close the template dropdown.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[372,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Name\" input field, specifically on the text \"my_note\" (estimated center at [372, 153]). This field currently contains \"my_note\". This action is intended to close the template selection dropdown that was opened in the previous step and to focus the filename input field. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Name\\' input field at [372, 153] was successful. It closed the template selection dropdown that was previously open. The \\'Name\\' field containing \\'my_note\\' remains focused, which is the desired state for the next step of deleting the text. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by restoring the UI to a state where text input and modification are possible.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"67\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a KEYCODE_DEL (67) event to delete one character from the focused \\'Name\\' text field, which currently contains \\'my_note\\'. This is the first of 10 planned DEL events to clear the field. The field is expected to contain \\'my_not\\' after this action. Actual Outcome: The last action was `adb shell input keyevent 67` (KEYCODE_DEL). Before this action, the \\'Name\\' text field visually contained \\'my_note\\'. After the action, the screenshot shows the text in this field as \\'hy_note\\'. This change is unexpected for a standard KEYCODE_DEL operation if it simply deleted one character. The text field remains focused. While a modification to the text occurred, the precise nature of the KEYCODE_DEL\\'s effect is unclear due to the \\'my_note\\' to \\'hy_note\\' change and the conflicting XML data (which still reports \\'my_note\\'). However, an attempt to modify the text was made. The action moves towards clearing the field, assuming subsequent DEL events will continue to remove characters.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"67\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send another KEYCODE_DEL (67) event to delete one more character from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. Visually, the field contains \\'hy_note\\'. According to XML, it contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is part of the plan to clear the field before entering the new filename. The field is expected to contain \\'hy_not\\' or \\'y_note\\' or some other shortened version after this action, depending on how the DEL key is interpreted. Actual Outcome: The last action, sending a KEYCODE_DEL (67) event, failed to modify the text in the \\'Name\\' input field. Visually, the field still shows \\'hy_note\\', and the XML data reports the content as \\'my_note\\'. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the text was not deleted. The next step will be to try the \\'delete\\' action to clear the text field.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 18: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Use the \\'delete\\' action to remove all text from the focused \\'Name\\' input field. The field currently contains \\'my_note\\' according to XML (visually \\'hy_note\\'). This action is predicted to clear the text field, making it ready for the new filename input. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main interface is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[486,174],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \"Template Empty file\" (center at [486, 174]) to dismiss the currently open context menu (which shows \"Paste\" and a three-dot icon). This action is predicted to close the context menu, allowing further interaction with the filename text field. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on \"Template Empty file\" at [486, 174], did not dismiss the context menu as intended. Instead, it opened a dropdown list of templates. The context menu is no longer visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal because it introduced a new UI element (the template dropdown) that needs to be dismissed before proceeding with renaming the file. The next step should be to close the template dropdown.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[372,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Name\" input field, specifically on the text \"my_note\" (estimated center at [372, 153]). This field currently contains \"my_note\". This action is intended to close the template selection dropdown that was opened in the previous step and to focus the filename input field. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Name\\' input field at [372, 153] was successful. It closed the template selection dropdown that was previously open. The \\'Name\\' field containing \\'my_note\\' remains focused, which is the desired state for the next step of deleting the text. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by restoring the UI to a state where text input and modification are possible.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"67\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a KEYCODE_DEL (67) event to delete one character from the focused \\'Name\\' text field, which currently contains \\'my_note\\'. This is the first of 10 planned DEL events to clear the field. The field is expected to contain \\'my_not\\' after this action. Actual Outcome: The last action was `adb shell input keyevent 67` (KEYCODE_DEL). Before this action, the \\'Name\\' text field visually contained \\'my_note\\'. After the action, the screenshot shows the text in this field as \\'hy_note\\'. This change is unexpected for a standard KEYCODE_DEL operation if it simply deleted one character. The text field remains focused. While a modification to the text occurred, the precise nature of the KEYCODE_DEL\\'s effect is unclear due to the \\'my_note\\' to \\'hy_note\\' change and the conflicting XML data (which still reports \\'my_note\\'). However, an attempt to modify the text was made. The action moves towards clearing the field, assuming subsequent DEL events will continue to remove characters.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"67\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send another KEYCODE_DEL (67) event to delete one more character from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. Visually, the field contains \\'hy_note\\'. According to XML, it contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is part of the plan to clear the field before entering the new filename. The field is expected to contain \\'hy_not\\' or \\'y_note\\' or some other shortened version after this action, depending on how the DEL key is interpreted. Actual Outcome: The last action, sending a KEYCODE_DEL (67) event, failed to modify the text in the \\'Name\\' input field. Visually, the field still shows \\'hy_note\\', and the XML data reports the content as \\'my_note\\'. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the text was not deleted. The next step will be to try the \\'delete\\' action to clear the text field.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Use the \\'delete\\' action to remove all text from the focused \\'Name\\' input field. The field currently contains \\'my_note\\' according to XML (visually \\'hy_note\\'). This action is predicted to clear the text field, making it ready for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The last action, `delete text`, failed to modify the text in the \\'Name\\' input field. Visually, the field still shows \\'hy_note\\', and the XML data reports the content as \\'my_note\\'. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the text was not deleted. This marks another unsuccessful attempt to clear the text field, indicating a persistent issue with text manipulation in this application via ADB.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nCreate a note in Markor named 2023_09_08_active_umbrella.txt. Perform a paste operation in the note and save the note.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[486,174],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \"Template Empty file\" (center at [486, 174]) to dismiss the currently open context menu (which shows \"Paste\" and a three-dot icon). This action is predicted to close the context menu, allowing further interaction with the filename text field. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on \"Template Empty file\" at [486, 174], did not dismiss the context menu as intended. Instead, it opened a dropdown list of templates. The context menu is no longer visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal because it introduced a new UI element (the template dropdown) that needs to be dismissed before proceeding with renaming the file. The next step should be to close the template dropdown.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[372,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Name\" input field, specifically on the text \"my_note\" (estimated center at [372, 153]). This field currently contains \"my_note\". This action is intended to close the template selection dropdown that was opened in the previous step and to focus the filename input field. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Name\\' input field at [372, 153] was successful. It closed the template selection dropdown that was previously open. The \\'Name\\' field containing \\'my_note\\' remains focused, which is the desired state for the next step of deleting the text. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by restoring the UI to a state where text input and modification are possible.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"67\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a KEYCODE_DEL (67) event to delete one character from the focused \\'Name\\' text field, which currently contains \\'my_note\\'. This is the first of 10 planned DEL events to clear the field. The field is expected to contain \\'my_not\\' after this action. Actual Outcome: The last action was `adb shell input keyevent 67` (KEYCODE_DEL). Before this action, the \\'Name\\' text field visually contained \\'my_note\\'. After the action, the screenshot shows the text in this field as \\'hy_note\\'. This change is unexpected for a standard KEYCODE_DEL operation if it simply deleted one character. The text field remains focused. While a modification to the text occurred, the precise nature of the KEYCODE_DEL\\'s effect is unclear due to the \\'my_note\\' to \\'hy_note\\' change and the conflicting XML data (which still reports \\'my_note\\'). However, an attempt to modify the text was made. The action moves towards clearing the field, assuming subsequent DEL events will continue to remove characters.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"67\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send another KEYCODE_DEL (67) event to delete one more character from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. Visually, the field contains \\'hy_note\\'. According to XML, it contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is part of the plan to clear the field before entering the new filename. The field is expected to contain \\'hy_not\\' or \\'y_note\\' or some other shortened version after this action, depending on how the DEL key is interpreted. Actual Outcome: The last action, sending a KEYCODE_DEL (67) event, failed to modify the text in the \\'Name\\' input field. Visually, the field still shows \\'hy_note\\', and the XML data reports the content as \\'my_note\\'. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the text was not deleted. The next step will be to try the \\'delete\\' action to clear the text field.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Use the \\'delete\\' action to remove all text from the focused \\'Name\\' input field. The field currently contains \\'my_note\\' according to XML (visually \\'hy_note\\'). This action is predicted to clear the text field, making it ready for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The last action, `delete text`, failed to modify the text in the \\'Name\\' input field. Visually, the field still shows \\'hy_note\\', and the XML data reports the content as \\'my_note\\'. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the text was not deleted. This marks another unsuccessful attempt to clear the text field, indicating a persistent issue with text manipulation in this application via ADB.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 19: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[380,373],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the \\'Name\\' input field, which currently contains \"my_note\" (visually \"hy_note\"), at coordinates [380, 373]. This is an attempt to select the text or bring up a context menu with selection options like \"Select All\" or \"Cut\", as part of the process to clear the field for the new filename. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main interface is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[372,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Name\" input field, specifically on the text \"my_note\" (estimated center at [372, 153]). This field currently contains \"my_note\". This action is intended to close the template selection dropdown that was opened in the previous step and to focus the filename input field. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Name\\' input field at [372, 153] was successful. It closed the template selection dropdown that was previously open. The \\'Name\\' field containing \\'my_note\\' remains focused, which is the desired state for the next step of deleting the text. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by restoring the UI to a state where text input and modification are possible.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"67\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a KEYCODE_DEL (67) event to delete one character from the focused \\'Name\\' text field, which currently contains \\'my_note\\'. This is the first of 10 planned DEL events to clear the field. The field is expected to contain \\'my_not\\' after this action. Actual Outcome: The last action was `adb shell input keyevent 67` (KEYCODE_DEL). Before this action, the \\'Name\\' text field visually contained \\'my_note\\'. After the action, the screenshot shows the text in this field as \\'hy_note\\'. This change is unexpected for a standard KEYCODE_DEL operation if it simply deleted one character. The text field remains focused. While a modification to the text occurred, the precise nature of the KEYCODE_DEL\\'s effect is unclear due to the \\'my_note\\' to \\'hy_note\\' change and the conflicting XML data (which still reports \\'my_note\\'). However, an attempt to modify the text was made. The action moves towards clearing the field, assuming subsequent DEL events will continue to remove characters.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"67\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send another KEYCODE_DEL (67) event to delete one more character from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. Visually, the field contains \\'hy_note\\'. According to XML, it contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is part of the plan to clear the field before entering the new filename. The field is expected to contain \\'hy_not\\' or \\'y_note\\' or some other shortened version after this action, depending on how the DEL key is interpreted. Actual Outcome: The last action, sending a KEYCODE_DEL (67) event, failed to modify the text in the \\'Name\\' input field. Visually, the field still shows \\'hy_note\\', and the XML data reports the content as \\'my_note\\'. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the text was not deleted. The next step will be to try the \\'delete\\' action to clear the text field.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Use the \\'delete\\' action to remove all text from the focused \\'Name\\' input field. The field currently contains \\'my_note\\' according to XML (visually \\'hy_note\\'). This action is predicted to clear the text field, making it ready for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The last action, `delete text`, failed to modify the text in the \\'Name\\' input field. Visually, the field still shows \\'hy_note\\', and the XML data reports the content as \\'my_note\\'. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the text was not deleted. This marks another unsuccessful attempt to clear the text field, indicating a persistent issue with text manipulation in this application via ADB.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[380,373],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the \\'Name\\' input field, which currently contains \"my_note\" (visually \"hy_note\"), at coordinates [380, 373]. This is an attempt to select the text or bring up a context menu with selection options like \"Select All\" or \"Cut\", as part of the process to clear the field for the new filename. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the \\'Name\\' input field at [380, 373] was successful. It caused a context menu to appear above the text field. This menu contains a \\'Paste\\' option and a three-dot icon. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing a new avenue for text manipulation, which is necessary to clear the current filename before entering the desired one.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nCreate a note in Markor named 2023_09_08_active_umbrella.txt. Perform a paste operation in the note and save the note.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[372,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Name\" input field, specifically on the text \"my_note\" (estimated center at [372, 153]). This field currently contains \"my_note\". This action is intended to close the template selection dropdown that was opened in the previous step and to focus the filename input field. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Name\\' input field at [372, 153] was successful. It closed the template selection dropdown that was previously open. The \\'Name\\' field containing \\'my_note\\' remains focused, which is the desired state for the next step of deleting the text. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by restoring the UI to a state where text input and modification are possible.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"67\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a KEYCODE_DEL (67) event to delete one character from the focused \\'Name\\' text field, which currently contains \\'my_note\\'. This is the first of 10 planned DEL events to clear the field. The field is expected to contain \\'my_not\\' after this action. Actual Outcome: The last action was `adb shell input keyevent 67` (KEYCODE_DEL). Before this action, the \\'Name\\' text field visually contained \\'my_note\\'. After the action, the screenshot shows the text in this field as \\'hy_note\\'. This change is unexpected for a standard KEYCODE_DEL operation if it simply deleted one character. The text field remains focused. While a modification to the text occurred, the precise nature of the KEYCODE_DEL\\'s effect is unclear due to the \\'my_note\\' to \\'hy_note\\' change and the conflicting XML data (which still reports \\'my_note\\'). However, an attempt to modify the text was made. The action moves towards clearing the field, assuming subsequent DEL events will continue to remove characters.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"67\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send another KEYCODE_DEL (67) event to delete one more character from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. Visually, the field contains \\'hy_note\\'. According to XML, it contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is part of the plan to clear the field before entering the new filename. The field is expected to contain \\'hy_not\\' or \\'y_note\\' or some other shortened version after this action, depending on how the DEL key is interpreted. Actual Outcome: The last action, sending a KEYCODE_DEL (67) event, failed to modify the text in the \\'Name\\' input field. Visually, the field still shows \\'hy_note\\', and the XML data reports the content as \\'my_note\\'. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the text was not deleted. The next step will be to try the \\'delete\\' action to clear the text field.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Use the \\'delete\\' action to remove all text from the focused \\'Name\\' input field. The field currently contains \\'my_note\\' according to XML (visually \\'hy_note\\'). This action is predicted to clear the text field, making it ready for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The last action, `delete text`, failed to modify the text in the \\'Name\\' input field. Visually, the field still shows \\'hy_note\\', and the XML data reports the content as \\'my_note\\'. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the text was not deleted. This marks another unsuccessful attempt to clear the text field, indicating a persistent issue with text manipulation in this application via ADB.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[380,373],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the \\'Name\\' input field, which currently contains \"my_note\" (visually \"hy_note\"), at coordinates [380, 373]. This is an attempt to select the text or bring up a context menu with selection options like \"Select All\" or \"Cut\", as part of the process to clear the field for the new filename. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the \\'Name\\' input field at [380, 373] was successful. It caused a context menu to appear above the text field. This menu contains a \\'Paste\\' option and a three-dot icon. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing a new avenue for text manipulation, which is necessary to clear the current filename before entering the desired one.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 20: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[406,248],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot icon in the context menu. This icon is located to the right of the \\'Paste\\' option, within the context menu that appeared after long-pressing the \\'Name\\' field. The approximate coordinates for the tap are [406, 248]. This action is expected to open a further menu with more text manipulation options, hopefully including \\'Select All\\' or \\'Cut\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main interface is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard.

Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution.

This is the first of 10 planned DEL events to clear the field. The field is expected to contain \\'my_not\\' after this action. Actual Outcome: The last action was `adb shell input keyevent 67` (KEYCODE_DEL). Before this action, the \\'Name\\' text field visually contained \\'my_note\\'. After the action, the screenshot shows the text in this field as \\'hy_note\\'. This change is unexpected for a standard KEYCODE_DEL operation if it simply deleted one character. The text field remains focused. While a modification to the text occurred, the precise nature of the KEYCODE_DEL\\'s effect is unclear due to the \\'my_note\\' to \\'hy_note\\' change and the conflicting XML data (which still reports \\'my_note\\'). However, an attempt to modify the text was made. The action moves towards clearing the field, assuming subsequent DEL events will continue to remove characters.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"67\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send another KEYCODE_DEL (67) event to delete one more character from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. Visually, the field contains \\'hy_note\\'. According to XML, it contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is part of the plan to clear the field before entering the new filename. The field is expected to contain \\'hy_not\\' or \\'y_note\\' or some other shortened version after this action, depending on how the DEL key is interpreted. Actual Outcome: The last action, sending a KEYCODE_DEL (67) event, failed to modify the text in the \\'Name\\' input field. Visually, the field still shows \\'hy_note\\', and the XML data reports the content as \\'my_note\\'. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the text was not deleted. The next step will be to try the \\'delete\\' action to clear the text field.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Use the \\'delete\\' action to remove all text from the focused \\'Name\\' input field. The field currently contains \\'my_note\\' according to XML (visually \\'hy_note\\'). This action is predicted to clear the text field, making it ready for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The last action, `delete text`, failed to modify the text in the \\'Name\\' input field. Visually, the field still shows \\'hy_note\\', and the XML data reports the content as \\'my_note\\'. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the text was not deleted. This marks another unsuccessful attempt to clear the text field, indicating a persistent issue with text manipulation in this application via ADB.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[380,373],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the \\'Name\\' input field, which currently contains \"my_note\" (visually \"hy_note\"), at coordinates [380, 373]. This is an attempt to select the text or bring up a context menu with selection options like \"Select All\" or \"Cut\", as part of the process to clear the field for the new filename. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the \\'Name\\' input field at [380, 373] was successful. It caused a context menu to appear above the text field. This menu contains a \\'Paste\\' option and a three-dot icon. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing a new avenue for text manipulation, which is necessary to clear the current filename before entering the desired one.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[406,248],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot icon in the context menu. This icon is located to the right of the \\'Paste\\' option, within the context menu that appeared after long-pressing the \\'Name\\' field. The approximate coordinates for the tap are [406, 248]. This action is expected to open a further menu with more text manipulation options, hopefully including \\'Select All\\' or \\'Cut\\'. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping the three-dot icon at approximately [406, 248], successfully changed the context menu. The previous menu (with \\'Paste\\' and the three-dot icon) was replaced by a new menu showing \\'Autofill\\' and a back arrow. This new menu does not provide \\'Select All\\' or \\'Cut\\' options. Therefore, while the action itself was executed correctly (a new menu appeared), it did not lead to the desired text manipulation options needed to easily clear the field. The agent is still working on clearing the \\'Name\\' field to input the correct filename.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below.

Perform a paste operation in the note and save the note.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"67\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a KEYCODE_DEL (67) event to delete one character from the focused \\'Name\\' text field, which currently contains \\'my_note\\'. This is the first of 10 planned DEL events to clear the field. The field is expected to contain \\'my_not\\' after this action. Actual Outcome: The last action was `adb shell input keyevent 67` (KEYCODE_DEL). Before this action, the \\'Name\\' text field visually contained \\'my_note\\'. After the action, the screenshot shows the text in this field as \\'hy_note\\'. This change is unexpected for a standard KEYCODE_DEL operation if it simply deleted one character. The text field remains focused. While a modification to the text occurred, the precise nature of the KEYCODE_DEL\\'s effect is unclear due to the \\'my_note\\' to \\'hy_note\\' change and the conflicting XML data (which still reports \\'my_note\\'). However, an attempt to modify the text was made. The action moves towards clearing the field, assuming subsequent DEL events will continue to remove characters.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"67\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send another KEYCODE_DEL (67) event to delete one more character from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. Visually, the field contains \\'hy_note\\'. According to XML, it contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is part of the plan to clear the field before entering the new filename. The field is expected to contain \\'hy_not\\' or \\'y_note\\' or some other shortened version after this action, depending on how the DEL key is interpreted. Actual Outcome: The last action, sending a KEYCODE_DEL (67) event, failed to modify the text in the \\'Name\\' input field. Visually, the field still shows \\'hy_note\\', and the XML data reports the content as \\'my_note\\'. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the text was not deleted. The next step will be to try the \\'delete\\' action to clear the text field.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Use the \\'delete\\' action to remove all text from the focused \\'Name\\' input field. The field currently contains \\'my_note\\' according to XML (visually \\'hy_note\\'). This action is predicted to clear the text field, making it ready for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The last action, `delete text`, failed to modify the text in the \\'Name\\' input field. Visually, the field still shows \\'hy_note\\', and the XML data reports the content as \\'my_note\\'. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the text was not deleted. This marks another unsuccessful attempt to clear the text field, indicating a persistent issue with text manipulation in this application via ADB.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[380,373],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the \\'Name\\' input field, which currently contains \"my_note\" (visually \"hy_note\"), at coordinates [380, 373]. This is an attempt to select the text or bring up a context menu with selection options like \"Select All\" or \"Cut\", as part of the process to clear the field for the new filename. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the \\'Name\\' input field at [380, 373] was successful. It caused a context menu to appear above the text field. This menu contains a \\'Paste\\' option and a three-dot icon. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing a new avenue for text manipulation, which is necessary to clear the current filename before entering the desired one.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[406,248],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot icon in the context menu. This icon is located to the right of the \\'Paste\\' option, within the context menu that appeared after long-pressing the \\'Name\\' field. The approximate coordinates for the tap are [406, 248]. This action is expected to open a further menu with more text manipulation options, hopefully including \\'Select All\\' or \\'Cut\\'. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping the three-dot icon at approximately [406, 248], successfully changed the context menu. The previous menu (with \\'Paste\\' and the three-dot icon) was replaced by a new menu showing \\'Autofill\\' and a back arrow. This new menu does not provide \\'Select All\\' or \\'Cut\\' options. Therefore, while the action itself was executed correctly (a new menu appeared), it did not lead to the desired text manipulation options needed to easily clear the field. The agent is still working on clearing the \\'Name\\' field to input the correct filename.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 21: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[355,140],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located at approximately [355, 140] within the \"Autofill\" context menu. This is expected to close the \"Autofill\" context menu and potentially reveal the previous context menu or return focus to the dialog.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Perform a paste operation in the note and save the note.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"67\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send another KEYCODE_DEL (67) event to delete one more character from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. Visually, the field contains \\'hy_note\\'. According to XML, it contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is part of the plan to clear the field before entering the new filename. The field is expected to contain \\'hy_not\\' or \\'y_note\\' or some other shortened version after this action, depending on how the DEL key is interpreted. Actual Outcome: The last action, sending a KEYCODE_DEL (67) event, failed to modify the text in the \\'Name\\' input field. Visually, the field still shows \\'hy_note\\', and the XML data reports the content as \\'my_note\\'. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the text was not deleted. The next step will be to try the \\'delete\\' action to clear the text field.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Use the \\'delete\\' action to remove all text from the focused \\'Name\\' input field. The field currently contains \\'my_note\\' according to XML (visually \\'hy_note\\'). This action is predicted to clear the text field, making it ready for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The last action, `delete text`, failed to modify the text in the \\'Name\\' input field. Visually, the field still shows \\'hy_note\\', and the XML data reports the content as \\'my_note\\'. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the text was not deleted. This marks another unsuccessful attempt to clear the text field, indicating a persistent issue with text manipulation in this application via ADB.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[380,373],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the \\'Name\\' input field, which currently contains \"my_note\" (visually \"hy_note\"), at coordinates [380, 373]. This is an attempt to select the text or bring up a context menu with selection options like \"Select All\" or \"Cut\", as part of the process to clear the field for the new filename. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the \\'Name\\' input field at [380, 373] was successful. It caused a context menu to appear above the text field. This menu contains a \\'Paste\\' option and a three-dot icon. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing a new avenue for text manipulation, which is necessary to clear the current filename before entering the desired one.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[406,248],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot icon in the context menu. This icon is located to the right of the \\'Paste\\' option, within the context menu that appeared after long-pressing the \\'Name\\' field. The approximate coordinates for the tap are [406, 248]. This action is expected to open a further menu with more text manipulation options, hopefully including \\'Select All\\' or \\'Cut\\'. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping the three-dot icon at approximately [406, 248], successfully changed the context menu. The previous menu (with \\'Paste\\' and the three-dot icon) was replaced by a new menu showing \\'Autofill\\' and a back arrow. This new menu does not provide \\'Select All\\' or \\'Cut\\' options. Therefore, while the action itself was executed correctly (a new menu appeared), it did not lead to the desired text manipulation options needed to easily clear the field. The agent is still working on clearing the \\'Name\\' field to input the correct filename.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[355,140],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located at approximately [355, 140] within the \"Autofill\" context menu. This is expected to close the \"Autofill\" context menu and potentially reveal the previous context menu or return focus to the dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (approximated at [355, 140]) successfully closed the \\'Autofill\\' context menu. The \\'Create new file\\' dialog is still active, and the \\'Name\\' text field remains focused with the content \\'my_note\\'. A toast notification \\'Contents can\\'t be autofilled\\' appeared. This action helped by removing an unhelpful menu, but the core task of modifying the filename in the \\'Name\\' field is still pending. The agent is closer to completing the subgoal by having a clear state to attempt text input.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 22: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"2023_09_08_active_umbrella\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \"2023_09_08_active_umbrella\" into the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The field currently contains \"my_note\". This action will attempt to replace or append to the existing text. The desired outcome is for the field to contain \"2023_09_08_active_umbrella\". The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main interface is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Use the \\'delete\\' action to remove all text from the focused \\'Name\\' input field. The field currently contains \\'my_note\\' according to XML (visually \\'hy_note\\'). This action is predicted to clear the text field, making it ready for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The last action, `delete text`, failed to modify the text in the \\'Name\\' input field. Visually, the field still shows \\'hy_note\\', and the XML data reports the content as \\'my_note\\'. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the text was not deleted. This marks another unsuccessful attempt to clear the text field, indicating a persistent issue with text manipulation in this application via ADB.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[380,373],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the \\'Name\\' input field, which currently contains \"my_note\" (visually \"hy_note\"), at coordinates [380, 373]. This is an attempt to select the text or bring up a context menu with selection options like \"Select All\" or \"Cut\", as part of the process to clear the field for the new filename. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the \\'Name\\' input field at [380, 373] was successful. It caused a context menu to appear above the text field. This menu contains a \\'Paste\\' option and a three-dot icon. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing a new avenue for text manipulation, which is necessary to clear the current filename before entering the desired one.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[406,248],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot icon in the context menu. This icon is located to the right of the \\'Paste\\' option, within the context menu that appeared after long-pressing the \\'Name\\' field. The approximate coordinates for the tap are [406, 248]. This action is expected to open a further menu with more text manipulation options, hopefully including \\'Select All\\' or \\'Cut\\'. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping the three-dot icon at approximately [406, 248], successfully changed the context menu. The previous menu (with \\'Paste\\' and the three-dot icon) was replaced by a new menu showing \\'Autofill\\' and a back arrow. This new menu does not provide \\'Select All\\' or \\'Cut\\' options. Therefore, while the action itself was executed correctly (a new menu appeared), it did not lead to the desired text manipulation options needed to easily clear the field. The agent is still working on clearing the \\'Name\\' field to input the correct filename.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[355,140],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located at approximately [355, 140] within the \"Autofill\" context menu. This is expected to close the \"Autofill\" context menu and potentially reveal the previous context menu or return focus to the dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (approximated at [355, 140]) successfully closed the \\'Autofill\\' context menu. The \\'Create new file\\' dialog is still active, and the \\'Name\\' text field remains focused with the content \\'my_note\\'. A toast notification \\'Contents can\\'t be autofilled\\' appeared. This action helped by removing an unhelpful menu, but the core task of modifying the filename in the \\'Name\\' field is still pending. The agent is closer to completing the subgoal by having a clear state to attempt text input.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"2023_09_08_active_umbrella\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \"2023_09_08_active_umbrella\" into the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The field currently contains \"my_note\". This action will attempt to replace or append to the existing text. The desired outcome is for the field to contain \"2023_09_08_active_umbrella\". Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'2023_09_08_active_umbrella\\' into the \\'Name\\' text field was successful. The text field now contains the desired filename base. This action brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of creating and naming the new note.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"2023_09_08_active_umbrella\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Perform a paste operation in the note and save the note.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Use the \\'delete\\' action to remove all text from the focused \\'Name\\' input field. The field currently contains \\'my_note\\' according to XML (visually \\'hy_note\\'). This action is predicted to clear the text field, making it ready for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The last action, `delete text`, failed to modify the text in the \\'Name\\' input field. Visually, the field still shows \\'hy_note\\', and the XML data reports the content as \\'my_note\\'. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the text was not deleted. This marks another unsuccessful attempt to clear the text field, indicating a persistent issue with text manipulation in this application via ADB.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[380,373],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the \\'Name\\' input field, which currently contains \"my_note\" (visually \"hy_note\"), at coordinates [380, 373]. This is an attempt to select the text or bring up a context menu with selection options like \"Select All\" or \"Cut\", as part of the process to clear the field for the new filename. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the \\'Name\\' input field at [380, 373] was successful. It caused a context menu to appear above the text field. This menu contains a \\'Paste\\' option and a three-dot icon. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing a new avenue for text manipulation, which is necessary to clear the current filename before entering the desired one.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[406,248],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot icon in the context menu. This icon is located to the right of the \\'Paste\\' option, within the context menu that appeared after long-pressing the \\'Name\\' field. The approximate coordinates for the tap are [406, 248]. This action is expected to open a further menu with more text manipulation options, hopefully including \\'Select All\\' or \\'Cut\\'. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping the three-dot icon at approximately [406, 248], successfully changed the context menu. The previous menu (with \\'Paste\\' and the three-dot icon) was replaced by a new menu showing \\'Autofill\\' and a back arrow. This new menu does not provide \\'Select All\\' or \\'Cut\\' options. Therefore, while the action itself was executed correctly (a new menu appeared), it did not lead to the desired text manipulation options needed to easily clear the field. The agent is still working on clearing the \\'Name\\' field to input the correct filename.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[355,140],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located at approximately [355, 140] within the \"Autofill\" context menu. This is expected to close the \"Autofill\" context menu and potentially reveal the previous context menu or return focus to the dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (approximated at [355, 140]) successfully closed the \\'Autofill\\' context menu. The \\'Create new file\\' dialog is still active, and the \\'Name\\' text field remains focused with the content \\'my_note\\'. A toast notification \\'Contents can\\'t be autofilled\\' appeared. This action helped by removing an unhelpful menu, but the core task of modifying the filename in the \\'Name\\' field is still pending. The agent is closer to completing the subgoal by having a clear state to attempt text input.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"2023_09_08_active_umbrella\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \"2023_09_08_active_umbrella\" into the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The field currently contains \"my_note\". This action will attempt to replace or append to the existing text. The desired outcome is for the field to contain \"2023_09_08_active_umbrella\". Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'2023_09_08_active_umbrella\\' into the \\'Name\\' text field was successful. The text field now contains the desired filename base. This action brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of creating and naming the new note.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 23: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[430,179],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \"Markdown\" (center of [412, 75, 448, 284]) to open the file type selection dropdown. This is expected to show a list of available file types, from which \"Plain Text\" or an equivalent can be selected to change the file extension to \".txt\". The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main interface is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[380,373],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the \\'Name\\' input field, which currently contains \"my_note\" (visually \"hy_note\"), at coordinates [380, 373]. This is an attempt to select the text or bring up a context menu with selection options like \"Select All\" or \"Cut\", as part of the process to clear the field for the new filename. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the \\'Name\\' input field at [380, 373] was successful. It caused a context menu to appear above the text field. This menu contains a \\'Paste\\' option and a three-dot icon. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing a new avenue for text manipulation, which is necessary to clear the current filename before entering the desired one.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[406,248],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot icon in the context menu. This icon is located to the right of the \\'Paste\\' option, within the context menu that appeared after long-pressing the \\'Name\\' field. The approximate coordinates for the tap are [406, 248]. This action is expected to open a further menu with more text manipulation options, hopefully including \\'Select All\\' or \\'Cut\\'. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping the three-dot icon at approximately [406, 248], successfully changed the context menu. The previous menu (with \\'Paste\\' and the three-dot icon) was replaced by a new menu showing \\'Autofill\\' and a back arrow. This new menu does not provide \\'Select All\\' or \\'Cut\\' options. Therefore, while the action itself was executed correctly (a new menu appeared), it did not lead to the desired text manipulation options needed to easily clear the field. The agent is still working on clearing the \\'Name\\' field to input the correct filename.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[355,140],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located at approximately [355, 140] within the \"Autofill\" context menu. This is expected to close the \"Autofill\" context menu and potentially reveal the previous context menu or return focus to the dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (approximated at [355, 140]) successfully closed the \\'Autofill\\' context menu. The \\'Create new file\\' dialog is still active, and the \\'Name\\' text field remains focused with the content \\'my_note\\'. A toast notification \\'Contents can\\'t be autofilled\\' appeared. This action helped by removing an unhelpful menu, but the core task of modifying the filename in the \\'Name\\' field is still pending. The agent is closer to completing the subgoal by having a clear state to attempt text input.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"2023_09_08_active_umbrella\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \"2023_09_08_active_umbrella\" into the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The field currently contains \"my_note\". This action will attempt to replace or append to the existing text. The desired outcome is for the field to contain \"2023_09_08_active_umbrella\". Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'2023_09_08_active_umbrella\\' into the \\'Name\\' text field was successful. The text field now contains the desired filename base. This action brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of creating and naming the new note.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[430,179],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \"Markdown\" (center of [412, 75, 448, 284]) to open the file type selection dropdown. This is expected to show a list of available file types, from which \"Plain Text\" or an equivalent can be selected to change the file extension to \".txt\". Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Markdown\\' (approximated at [430, 179] which corresponds to the text \\'Markdown\\' with bounding box [412, 75, 448, 284]) successfully opened a dropdown menu listing available file types. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing the selection of the correct file type (\\'Plain Text\\') for the desired \\'.txt\\' extension.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"2023_09_08_active_umbrella\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nCreate a note in Markor named 2023_09_08_active_umbrella.txt. Perform a paste operation in the note and save the note.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[380,373],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the \\'Name\\' input field, which currently contains \"my_note\" (visually \"hy_note\"), at coordinates [380, 373]. This is an attempt to select the text or bring up a context menu with selection options like \"Select All\" or \"Cut\", as part of the process to clear the field for the new filename. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the \\'Name\\' input field at [380, 373] was successful. It caused a context menu to appear above the text field. This menu contains a \\'Paste\\' option and a three-dot icon. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing a new avenue for text manipulation, which is necessary to clear the current filename before entering the desired one.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[406,248],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot icon in the context menu. This icon is located to the right of the \\'Paste\\' option, within the context menu that appeared after long-pressing the \\'Name\\' field. The approximate coordinates for the tap are [406, 248]. This action is expected to open a further menu with more text manipulation options, hopefully including \\'Select All\\' or \\'Cut\\'. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping the three-dot icon at approximately [406, 248], successfully changed the context menu. The previous menu (with \\'Paste\\' and the three-dot icon) was replaced by a new menu showing \\'Autofill\\' and a back arrow. This new menu does not provide \\'Select All\\' or \\'Cut\\' options. Therefore, while the action itself was executed correctly (a new menu appeared), it did not lead to the desired text manipulation options needed to easily clear the field. The agent is still working on clearing the \\'Name\\' field to input the correct filename.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[355,140],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located at approximately [355, 140] within the \"Autofill\" context menu. This is expected to close the \"Autofill\" context menu and potentially reveal the previous context menu or return focus to the dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (approximated at [355, 140]) successfully closed the \\'Autofill\\' context menu. The \\'Create new file\\' dialog is still active, and the \\'Name\\' text field remains focused with the content \\'my_note\\'. A toast notification \\'Contents can\\'t be autofilled\\' appeared. This action helped by removing an unhelpful menu, but the core task of modifying the filename in the \\'Name\\' field is still pending. The agent is closer to completing the subgoal by having a clear state to attempt text input.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"2023_09_08_active_umbrella\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \"2023_09_08_active_umbrella\" into the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The field currently contains \"my_note\". This action will attempt to replace or append to the existing text. The desired outcome is for the field to contain \"2023_09_08_active_umbrella\". Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'2023_09_08_active_umbrella\\' into the \\'Name\\' text field was successful. The text field now contains the desired filename base. This action brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of creating and naming the new note.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[430,179],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \"Markdown\" (center of [412, 75, 448, 284]) to open the file type selection dropdown. This is expected to show a list of available file types, from which \"Plain Text\" or an equivalent can be selected to change the file extension to \".txt\". Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Markdown\\' (approximated at [430, 179] which corresponds to the text \\'Markdown\\' with bounding box [412, 75, 448, 284]) successfully opened a dropdown menu listing available file types. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing the selection of the correct file type (\\'Plain Text\\') for the desired \\'.txt\\' extension.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 24: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[505,183],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \"Plain Text\" in the file type selection dropdown. The text \"Plain Text\" is located at coordinates approximately [505, 183] (center of bounding box [497, 96, 514, 271]). This action is expected to select \"Plain Text\" as the file type, close the dropdown, and change the displayed file extension from \".md\" to \".txt\". The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main interface is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[406,248],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot icon in the context menu. This icon is located to the right of the \\'Paste\\' option, within the context menu that appeared after long-pressing the \\'Name\\' field. The approximate coordinates for the tap are [406, 248]. This action is expected to open a further menu with more text manipulation options, hopefully including \\'Select All\\' or \\'Cut\\'. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping the three-dot icon at approximately [406, 248], successfully changed the context menu. The previous menu (with \\'Paste\\' and the three-dot icon) was replaced by a new menu showing \\'Autofill\\' and a back arrow. This new menu does not provide \\'Select All\\' or \\'Cut\\' options. Therefore, while the action itself was executed correctly (a new menu appeared), it did not lead to the desired text manipulation options needed to easily clear the field. The agent is still working on clearing the \\'Name\\' field to input the correct filename.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[355,140],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located at approximately [355, 140] within the \"Autofill\" context menu. This is expected to close the \"Autofill\" context menu and potentially reveal the previous context menu or return focus to the dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (approximated at [355, 140]) successfully closed the \\'Autofill\\' context menu. The \\'Create new file\\' dialog is still active, and the \\'Name\\' text field remains focused with the content \\'my_note\\'. A toast notification \\'Contents can\\'t be autofilled\\' appeared. This action helped by removing an unhelpful menu, but the core task of modifying the filename in the \\'Name\\' field is still pending. The agent is closer to completing the subgoal by having a clear state to attempt text input.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"2023_09_08_active_umbrella\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \"2023_09_08_active_umbrella\" into the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The field currently contains \"my_note\". This action will attempt to replace or append to the existing text. The desired outcome is for the field to contain \"2023_09_08_active_umbrella\". Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'2023_09_08_active_umbrella\\' into the \\'Name\\' text field was successful. The text field now contains the desired filename base. This action brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of creating and naming the new note.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[430,179],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \"Markdown\" (center of [412, 75, 448, 284]) to open the file type selection dropdown. This is expected to show a list of available file types, from which \"Plain Text\" or an equivalent can be selected to change the file extension to \".txt\". Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Markdown\\' (approximated at [430, 179] which corresponds to the text \\'Markdown\\' with bounding box [412, 75, 448, 284]) successfully opened a dropdown menu listing available file types. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing the selection of the correct file type (\\'Plain Text\\') for the desired \\'.txt\\' extension.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[505,183],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \"Plain Text\" in the file type selection dropdown. The text \"Plain Text\" is located at coordinates approximately [505, 183] (center of bounding box [497, 96, 514, 271]). This action is expected to select \"Plain Text\" as the file type, close the dropdown, and change the displayed file extension from \".md\" to \".txt\". Actual Outcome: The tap on \"Plain Text\" (approximated at [505, 183]) was successful. The dropdown menu for file types closed, the \"Type\" field updated to \"Plain Text\", and the file extension displayed next to the filename input field changed from \".md\" to \".txt\". This action directly contributed to achieving the desired file name and type, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"2023_09_08_active_umbrella\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Perform a paste operation in the note and save the note.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[406,248],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot icon in the context menu. This icon is located to the right of the \\'Paste\\' option, within the context menu that appeared after long-pressing the \\'Name\\' field. The approximate coordinates for the tap are [406, 248]. This action is expected to open a further menu with more text manipulation options, hopefully including \\'Select All\\' or \\'Cut\\'. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping the three-dot icon at approximately [406, 248], successfully changed the context menu. The previous menu (with \\'Paste\\' and the three-dot icon) was replaced by a new menu showing \\'Autofill\\' and a back arrow. This new menu does not provide \\'Select All\\' or \\'Cut\\' options. Therefore, while the action itself was executed correctly (a new menu appeared), it did not lead to the desired text manipulation options needed to easily clear the field. The agent is still working on clearing the \\'Name\\' field to input the correct filename.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[355,140],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located at approximately [355, 140] within the \"Autofill\" context menu. This is expected to close the \"Autofill\" context menu and potentially reveal the previous context menu or return focus to the dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (approximated at [355, 140]) successfully closed the \\'Autofill\\' context menu. The \\'Create new file\\' dialog is still active, and the \\'Name\\' text field remains focused with the content \\'my_note\\'. A toast notification \\'Contents can\\'t be autofilled\\' appeared. This action helped by removing an unhelpful menu, but the core task of modifying the filename in the \\'Name\\' field is still pending. The agent is closer to completing the subgoal by having a clear state to attempt text input.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"2023_09_08_active_umbrella\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \"2023_09_08_active_umbrella\" into the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The field currently contains \"my_note\". This action will attempt to replace or append to the existing text. The desired outcome is for the field to contain \"2023_09_08_active_umbrella\". Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'2023_09_08_active_umbrella\\' into the \\'Name\\' text field was successful. The text field now contains the desired filename base. This action brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of creating and naming the new note.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[430,179],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \"Markdown\" (center of [412, 75, 448, 284]) to open the file type selection dropdown. This is expected to show a list of available file types, from which \"Plain Text\" or an equivalent can be selected to change the file extension to \".txt\". Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Markdown\\' (approximated at [430, 179] which corresponds to the text \\'Markdown\\' with bounding box [412, 75, 448, 284]) successfully opened a dropdown menu listing available file types. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing the selection of the correct file type (\\'Plain Text\\') for the desired \\'.txt\\' extension.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[505,183],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \"Plain Text\" in the file type selection dropdown. The text \"Plain Text\" is located at coordinates approximately [505, 183] (center of bounding box [497, 96, 514, 271]). This action is expected to select \"Plain Text\" as the file type, close the dropdown, and change the displayed file extension from \".md\" to \".txt\". Actual Outcome: The tap on \"Plain Text\" (approximated at [505, 183]) was successful. The dropdown menu for file types closed, the \"Type\" field updated to \"Plain Text\", and the file extension displayed next to the filename input field changed from \".md\" to \".txt\". This action directly contributed to achieving the desired file name and type, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 25: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[610,855],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"OK\" button, located at approximately [610, 855] (center of bounding box [603, 829, 618, 882]). This action is expected to close the \"Create new file\" dialog and open the newly created note in the editor, thus completing the current subgoal. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main interface is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[355,140],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located at approximately [355, 140] within the \"Autofill\" context menu. This is expected to close the \"Autofill\" context menu and potentially reveal the previous context menu or return focus to the dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (approximated at [355, 140]) successfully closed the \\'Autofill\\' context menu. The \\'Create new file\\' dialog is still active, and the \\'Name\\' text field remains focused with the content \\'my_note\\'. A toast notification \\'Contents can\\'t be autofilled\\' appeared. This action helped by removing an unhelpful menu, but the core task of modifying the filename in the \\'Name\\' field is still pending. The agent is closer to completing the subgoal by having a clear state to attempt text input.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"2023_09_08_active_umbrella\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \"2023_09_08_active_umbrella\" into the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The field currently contains \"my_note\". This action will attempt to replace or append to the existing text. The desired outcome is for the field to contain \"2023_09_08_active_umbrella\". Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'2023_09_08_active_umbrella\\' into the \\'Name\\' text field was successful. The text field now contains the desired filename base. This action brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of creating and naming the new note.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[430,179],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \"Markdown\" (center of [412, 75, 448, 284]) to open the file type selection dropdown. This is expected to show a list of available file types, from which \"Plain Text\" or an equivalent can be selected to change the file extension to \".txt\". Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Markdown\\' (approximated at [430, 179] which corresponds to the text \\'Markdown\\' with bounding box [412, 75, 448, 284]) successfully opened a dropdown menu listing available file types. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing the selection of the correct file type (\\'Plain Text\\') for the desired \\'.txt\\' extension.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[505,183],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \"Plain Text\" in the file type selection dropdown. The text \"Plain Text\" is located at coordinates approximately [505, 183] (center of bounding box [497, 96, 514, 271]). This action is expected to select \"Plain Text\" as the file type, close the dropdown, and change the displayed file extension from \".md\" to \".txt\". Actual Outcome: The tap on \"Plain Text\" (approximated at [505, 183]) was successful. The dropdown menu for file types closed, the \"Type\" field updated to \"Plain Text\", and the file extension displayed next to the filename input field changed from \".md\" to \".txt\". This action directly contributed to achieving the desired file name and type, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[610,855],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"OK\" button, located at approximately [610, 855] (center of bounding box [603, 829, 618, 882]). This action is expected to close the \"Create new file\" dialog and open the newly created note in the editor, thus completing the current subgoal. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'OK\\' button was successful. The \\'Create new file\\' dialog closed, and the note \\'2023_09_08_active_umbrella.txt\\' was created and opened in the Markor editor. The screen changed from the dialog to the note editor view. This action completed the active subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.56\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [73, 34, 100, 423], \\'text\\': \\'2023_09_08_ac.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [890, 143, 915, 336], \\'text\\': \\'= ,\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 653], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 907, 100, 985]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 835, 926, 931]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 822, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 596, 935, 699]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 243, 928, 344]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 951, 925, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 482, 939, 577]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 520, 98, 608]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 811, 102, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 617, 99, 703]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 363, 938, 461]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 127, 927, 226]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 905, 36, 943]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 713, 99, 800]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 719, 925, 814]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 9, 925, 102]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 195, 38, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 425, 102, 509]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: NAF=\"true\", index=\"0\", text=\"\", resource-id=\"net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"net.gsantner.markor\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[0,275][1080,2102]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Perform a paste operation in the note and save the note.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[355,140],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located at approximately [355, 140] within the \"Autofill\" context menu. This is expected to close the \"Autofill\" context menu and potentially reveal the previous context menu or return focus to the dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (approximated at [355, 140]) successfully closed the \\'Autofill\\' context menu. The \\'Create new file\\' dialog is still active, and the \\'Name\\' text field remains focused with the content \\'my_note\\'. A toast notification \\'Contents can\\'t be autofilled\\' appeared. This action helped by removing an unhelpful menu, but the core task of modifying the filename in the \\'Name\\' field is still pending. The agent is closer to completing the subgoal by having a clear state to attempt text input.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"2023_09_08_active_umbrella\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \"2023_09_08_active_umbrella\" into the focused \\'Name\\' text field. The field currently contains \"my_note\". This action will attempt to replace or append to the existing text. The desired outcome is for the field to contain \"2023_09_08_active_umbrella\". Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'2023_09_08_active_umbrella\\' into the \\'Name\\' text field was successful. The text field now contains the desired filename base. This action brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of creating and naming the new note.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[430,179],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \"Markdown\" (center of [412, 75, 448, 284]) to open the file type selection dropdown. This is expected to show a list of available file types, from which \"Plain Text\" or an equivalent can be selected to change the file extension to \".txt\". Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Markdown\\' (approximated at [430, 179] which corresponds to the text \\'Markdown\\' with bounding box [412, 75, 448, 284]) successfully opened a dropdown menu listing available file types. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing the selection of the correct file type (\\'Plain Text\\') for the desired \\'.txt\\' extension.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[505,183],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \"Plain Text\" in the file type selection dropdown. The text \"Plain Text\" is located at coordinates approximately [505, 183] (center of bounding box [497, 96, 514, 271]). This action is expected to select \"Plain Text\" as the file type, close the dropdown, and change the displayed file extension from \".md\" to \".txt\". Actual Outcome: The tap on \"Plain Text\" (approximated at [505, 183]) was successful. The dropdown menu for file types closed, the \"Type\" field updated to \"Plain Text\", and the file extension displayed next to the filename input field changed from \".md\" to \".txt\". This action directly contributed to achieving the desired file name and type, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[610,855],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"OK\" button, located at approximately [610, 855] (center of bounding box [603, 829, 618, 882]). This action is expected to close the \"Create new file\" dialog and open the newly created note in the editor, thus completing the current subgoal. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'OK\\' button was successful. The \\'Create new file\\' dialog closed, and the note \\'2023_09_08_active_umbrella.txt\\' was created and opened in the Markor editor. The screen changed from the dialog to the note editor view. This action completed the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 26: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[500,540],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the main text area of the note editor, specifically at coordinates [500, 540]. This area is currently empty and focused. This action is expected to bring up a context menu, which should include a \\'Paste\\' option. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main interface is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button.

The field currently contains \"my_note\". This action will attempt to replace or append to the existing text. The desired outcome is for the field to contain \"2023_09_08_active_umbrella\". Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'2023_09_08_active_umbrella\\' into the \\'Name\\' text field was successful. The text field now contains the desired filename base. This action brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of creating and naming the new note.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[430,179],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \"Markdown\" (center of [412, 75, 448, 284]) to open the file type selection dropdown. This is expected to show a list of available file types, from which \"Plain Text\" or an equivalent can be selected to change the file extension to \".txt\". Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Markdown\\' (approximated at [430, 179] which corresponds to the text \\'Markdown\\' with bounding box [412, 75, 448, 284]) successfully opened a dropdown menu listing available file types. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing the selection of the correct file type (\\'Plain Text\\') for the desired \\'.txt\\' extension.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[505,183],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \"Plain Text\" in the file type selection dropdown. The text \"Plain Text\" is located at coordinates approximately [505, 183] (center of bounding box [497, 96, 514, 271]). This action is expected to select \"Plain Text\" as the file type, close the dropdown, and change the displayed file extension from \".md\" to \".txt\". Actual Outcome: The tap on \"Plain Text\" (approximated at [505, 183]) was successful. The dropdown menu for file types closed, the \"Type\" field updated to \"Plain Text\", and the file extension displayed next to the filename input field changed from \".md\" to \".txt\". This action directly contributed to achieving the desired file name and type, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[610,855],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"OK\" button, located at approximately [610, 855] (center of bounding box [603, 829, 618, 882]). This action is expected to close the \"Create new file\" dialog and open the newly created note in the editor, thus completing the current subgoal. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'OK\\' button was successful. The \\'Create new file\\' dialog closed, and the note \\'2023_09_08_active_umbrella.txt\\' was created and opened in the Markor editor. The screen changed from the dialog to the note editor view. This action completed the active subgoal.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[500,540],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the main text area of the note editor, specifically at coordinates [500, 540]. This area is currently empty and focused. This action is expected to bring up a context menu, which should include a \\'Paste\\' option. Actual Outcome: The long_press action at [500, 540] was successful. It opened a context menu in the top-left of the screen, which includes a \\'Paste\\' option. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of pasting content into the note.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.56\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 66, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [77, 325, 96, 418], \\'text\\': \\'ac..\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [91, 79, 106, 171], \\'text\\': \\'Paste\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [890, 143, 915, 336], \\'text\\': \\'= ,\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 653], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 905, 102, 987]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 615, 102, 704]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 834, 926, 932]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 810, 104, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 519, 98, 607]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 950, 925, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 596, 933, 699]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 242, 928, 345]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 425, 98, 508]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 711, 102, 802]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 821, 36, 899]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 482, 939, 575]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 363, 937, 461]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 125, 927, 227]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 717, 926, 815]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 904, 36, 944]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 8, 926, 105]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 195, 38, 241]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [153, 1, 183, 70]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [70, 287, 100, 427]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: NAF=\"true\", index=\"0\", text=\"\", resource-id=\"net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"net.gsantner.markor\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[0,275][1080,2102]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.
