Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16.

To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance.

Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to reveal the list of installed applications, where I can then find and open the Markor app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to reveal the list of installed applications, where I can then find and open the Markor app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen now displays a list of installed applications, including the Markor app. This brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal of opening the Markor app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[867,615],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon at approximately [867, 615] to open the Markor app. The Markor app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. This action is expected to launch the Markor application. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Markor app icon successfully opened the Markor application. The screen transitioned from the app drawer to the Markor app\\'s main file browser interface. A red \\'+\\' button, typically used for creating new items, is now visible in the bottom right corner.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to reveal the list of installed applications, where I can then find and open the Markor app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen now displays a list of installed applications, including the Markor app. This brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal of opening the Markor app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[867,615],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon at approximately [867, 615] to open the Markor app. The Markor app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. This action is expected to launch the Markor application. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Markor app icon successfully opened the Markor application. The screen transitioned from the app drawer to the Markor app\\'s main file browser interface. A red \\'+\\' button, typically used for creating new items, is now visible in the bottom right corner. This action successfully completed Subgoal 1 and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[864,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the red \\'+\\' button located at approximately [864, 893] to initiate the creation of a new note. The button is currently visible and enabled. This action is expected to open a dialog or screen for creating a new note, possibly asking for a filename or opening an empty editor. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'+\\' button at [864, 893] was successful. A dialog box appeared, allowing the user to specify the name, type, and template for a new file. This dialog contains a text field for the name (pre-filled with \"my_note\"), type and template selectors, and \"FOLDER\", \"CANCEL\", and \"OK\" buttons. This action completed Subgoal 2 (\"Initiate New Note Creation\") and moved the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 3: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[402,154],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'my_note\\' (coordinates [402, 154]) in the \\'Name\\' field. This field is currently displaying \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to select the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to delete the current text and input the desired filename. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main screen is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to reveal the list of installed applications, where I can then find and open the Markor app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen now displays a list of installed applications, including the Markor app. This brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal of opening the Markor app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[867,615],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon at approximately [867, 615] to open the Markor app. The Markor app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. This action is expected to launch the Markor application. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Markor app icon successfully opened the Markor application. The screen transitioned from the app drawer to the Markor app\\'s main file browser interface. A red \\'+\\' button, typically used for creating new items, is now visible in the bottom right corner. This action successfully completed Subgoal 1 and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[864,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the red \\'+\\' button located at approximately [864, 893] to initiate the creation of a new note. The button is currently visible and enabled. This action is expected to open a dialog or screen for creating a new note, possibly asking for a filename or opening an empty editor. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'+\\' button at [864, 893] was successful. A dialog box appeared, allowing the user to specify the name, type, and template for a new file. This dialog contains a text field for the name (pre-filled with \"my_note\"), type and template selectors, and \"FOLDER\", \"CANCEL\", and \"OK\" buttons. This action completed Subgoal 2 (\"Initiate New Note Creation\") and moved the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[402,154],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'my_note\\' (coordinates [402, 154]) in the \\'Name\\' field. This field is currently displaying \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to select the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to delete the current text and input the desired filename. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'my_note\\' text field at [402, 154] did not select the text field as intended. Instead, an Android system error dialog titled \"com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\" appeared. This dialog prevents interaction with the underlying \"Create new file\" dialog. The action was a failure in terms of progressing the active subgoal, as an external error interrupted the intended workflow. The immediate next step is to dismiss this error dialog.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 4: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Close app\\' button in the error dialog. The \\'Close app\\' button is currently visible and enabled. This action is expected to dismiss the error dialog and allow interaction with the underlying \\'Create new file\\' dialog.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nCreate a new note in Markor named 2023_01_26_wise_yacht.md with the following text: Ignorance is bliss.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the middle of the screen (from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is expected to reveal the list of installed applications, where I can then find and open the Markor app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen now displays a list of installed applications, including the Markor app. This brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal of opening the Markor app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[867,615],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon at approximately [867, 615] to open the Markor app. The Markor app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. This action is expected to launch the Markor application. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Markor app icon successfully opened the Markor application. The screen transitioned from the app drawer to the Markor app\\'s main file browser interface. A red \\'+\\' button, typically used for creating new items, is now visible in the bottom right corner. This action successfully completed Subgoal 1 and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[864,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the red \\'+\\' button located at approximately [864, 893] to initiate the creation of a new note. The button is currently visible and enabled. This action is expected to open a dialog or screen for creating a new note, possibly asking for a filename or opening an empty editor. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'+\\' button at [864, 893] was successful. A dialog box appeared, allowing the user to specify the name, type, and template for a new file. This dialog contains a text field for the name (pre-filled with \"my_note\"), type and template selectors, and \"FOLDER\", \"CANCEL\", and \"OK\" buttons. This action completed Subgoal 2 (\"Initiate New Note Creation\") and moved the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[402,154],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'my_note\\' (coordinates [402, 154]) in the \\'Name\\' field. This field is currently displaying \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to select the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to delete the current text and input the desired filename. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'my_note\\' text field at [402, 154] did not select the text field as intended. Instead, an Android system error dialog titled \"com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\" appeared. This dialog prevents interaction with the underlying \"Create new file\" dialog. The action was a failure in terms of progressing the active subgoal, as an external error interrupted the intended workflow. The immediate next step is to dismiss this error dialog.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Close app\\' button in the error dialog. The \\'Close app\\' button is currently visible and enabled. This action is expected to dismiss the error dialog and allow interaction with the underlying \\'Create new file\\' dialog. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Close app\\' on the error dialog was successful. The error dialog disappeared, and the underlying \\'Create new file\\' dialog is now visible and accessible. This action brought the agent back on track to complete the active subgoal of setting the filename.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 5: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[396,154],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'my_note\\' (approximate coordinates [396, 154]) in the \\'Name\\' field. This field is currently displaying \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to select the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to delete the current text and input the desired filename.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is intended to select the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to delete the current text and input the desired filename. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'my_note\\' text field at [396, 154] was successful. The text field is now selected and focused, and the virtual keyboard (indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\') has appeared. This allows for text input into the filename field. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of setting the filename.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[867,615],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon at approximately [867, 615] to open the Markor app. The Markor app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. This action is expected to launch the Markor application. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Markor app icon successfully opened the Markor application. The screen transitioned from the app drawer to the Markor app\\'s main file browser interface. A red \\'+\\' button, typically used for creating new items, is now visible in the bottom right corner. This action successfully completed Subgoal 1 and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[864,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the red \\'+\\' button located at approximately [864, 893] to initiate the creation of a new note. The button is currently visible and enabled. This action is expected to open a dialog or screen for creating a new note, possibly asking for a filename or opening an empty editor. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'+\\' button at [864, 893] was successful. A dialog box appeared, allowing the user to specify the name, type, and template for a new file. This dialog contains a text field for the name (pre-filled with \"my_note\"), type and template selectors, and \"FOLDER\", \"CANCEL\", and \"OK\" buttons. This action completed Subgoal 2 (\"Initiate New Note Creation\") and moved the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[402,154],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'my_note\\' (coordinates [402, 154]) in the \\'Name\\' field. This field is currently displaying \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to select the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to delete the current text and input the desired filename. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'my_note\\' text field at [402, 154] did not select the text field as intended. Instead, an Android system error dialog titled \"com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\" appeared. This dialog prevents interaction with the underlying \"Create new file\" dialog. The action was a failure in terms of progressing the active subgoal, as an external error interrupted the intended workflow. The immediate next step is to dismiss this error dialog.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Close app\\' button in the error dialog. The \\'Close app\\' button is currently visible and enabled. This action is expected to dismiss the error dialog and allow interaction with the underlying \\'Create new file\\' dialog. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Close app\\' on the error dialog was successful. The error dialog disappeared, and the underlying \\'Create new file\\' dialog is now visible and accessible. This action brought the agent back on track to complete the active subgoal of setting the filename.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[396,154],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'my_note\\' (approximate coordinates [396, 154]) in the \\'Name\\' field. This field is currently displaying \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to select the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to delete the current text and input the desired filename. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'my_note\\' text field at [396, 154] was successful. The text field is now selected and focused, and the virtual keyboard (indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\') has appeared. This allows for text input into the filename field. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of setting the filename.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 6: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the focused filename field. The filename field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to clear the text field, allowing for the input of the new filename. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main screen is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[864,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the red \\'+\\' button located at approximately [864, 893] to initiate the creation of a new note. The button is currently visible and enabled. This action is expected to open a dialog or screen for creating a new note, possibly asking for a filename or opening an empty editor. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'+\\' button at [864, 893] was successful. A dialog box appeared, allowing the user to specify the name, type, and template for a new file. This dialog contains a text field for the name (pre-filled with \"my_note\"), type and template selectors, and \"FOLDER\", \"CANCEL\", and \"OK\" buttons. This action completed Subgoal 2 (\"Initiate New Note Creation\") and moved the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[402,154],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'my_note\\' (coordinates [402, 154]) in the \\'Name\\' field. This field is currently displaying \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to select the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to delete the current text and input the desired filename. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'my_note\\' text field at [402, 154] did not select the text field as intended. Instead, an Android system error dialog titled \"com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\" appeared. This dialog prevents interaction with the underlying \"Create new file\" dialog. The action was a failure in terms of progressing the active subgoal, as an external error interrupted the intended workflow. The immediate next step is to dismiss this error dialog.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Close app\\' button in the error dialog. The \\'Close app\\' button is currently visible and enabled. This action is expected to dismiss the error dialog and allow interaction with the underlying \\'Create new file\\' dialog. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Close app\\' on the error dialog was successful. The error dialog disappeared, and the underlying \\'Create new file\\' dialog is now visible and accessible. This action brought the agent back on track to complete the active subgoal of setting the filename.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[396,154],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'my_note\\' (approximate coordinates [396, 154]) in the \\'Name\\' field. This field is currently displaying \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to select the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to delete the current text and input the desired filename. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'my_note\\' text field at [396, 154] was successful. The text field is now selected and focused, and the virtual keyboard (indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\') has appeared. This allows for text input into the filename field. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of setting the filename.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the focused filename field. The filename field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to clear the text field, allowing for the input of the new filename. Actual Outcome: The \\'DELETE_TEXT\\' action failed to remove the text \\'my_note\\' from the filename field. The field still contains \\'my_note\\', the keyboard is active, and the \\'Create new file\\' dialog is unchanged. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To recover, the text needs to be deleted using an alternative method, such as sending multiple `KEYCODE_DEL` events, before the correct filename can be input.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[864,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the red \\'+\\' button located at approximately [864, 893] to initiate the creation of a new note. The button is currently visible and enabled. This action is expected to open a dialog or screen for creating a new note, possibly asking for a filename or opening an empty editor. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'+\\' button at [864, 893] was successful. A dialog box appeared, allowing the user to specify the name, type, and template for a new file. This dialog contains a text field for the name (pre-filled with \"my_note\"), type and template selectors, and \"FOLDER\", \"CANCEL\", and \"OK\" buttons. This action completed Subgoal 2 (\"Initiate New Note Creation\") and moved the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[402,154],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'my_note\\' (coordinates [402, 154]) in the \\'Name\\' field. This field is currently displaying \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to select the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to delete the current text and input the desired filename. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'my_note\\' text field at [402, 154] did not select the text field as intended. Instead, an Android system error dialog titled \"com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\" appeared. This dialog prevents interaction with the underlying \"Create new file\" dialog. The action was a failure in terms of progressing the active subgoal, as an external error interrupted the intended workflow. The immediate next step is to dismiss this error dialog.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Close app\\' button in the error dialog. The \\'Close app\\' button is currently visible and enabled. This action is expected to dismiss the error dialog and allow interaction with the underlying \\'Create new file\\' dialog. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Close app\\' on the error dialog was successful. The error dialog disappeared, and the underlying \\'Create new file\\' dialog is now visible and accessible. This action brought the agent back on track to complete the active subgoal of setting the filename.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[396,154],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'my_note\\' (approximate coordinates [396, 154]) in the \\'Name\\' field. This field is currently displaying \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to select the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to delete the current text and input the desired filename. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'my_note\\' text field at [396, 154] was successful. The text field is now selected and focused, and the virtual keyboard (indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\') has appeared. This allows for text input into the filename field. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of setting the filename.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the focused filename field. The filename field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to clear the text field, allowing for the input of the new filename. Actual Outcome: The \\'DELETE_TEXT\\' action failed to remove the text \\'my_note\\' from the filename field. The field still contains \\'my_note\\', the keyboard is active, and the \\'Create new file\\' dialog is unchanged. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To recover, the text needs to be deleted using an alternative method, such as sending multiple `KEYCODE_DEL` events, before the correct filename can be input.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 7: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a \\'KEYCODE_DEL\\' keyevent to delete one character from the focused filename field. The filename field currently contains \\'my_note\\' and is focused. This action is the first of seven planned \\'KEYCODE_DEL\\' events to clear the field. It is expected to delete the last character \\'e\\' from \\'my_note\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main screen is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Since both `DELETE_TEXT` and `KEYCODE_DEL` have failed to modify the text field, continuing with more `KEYCODE_DEL` events is unlikely to succeed. \\n\\nTherefore, the strategy for Subgoal 3 (Set Filename for the New Note) needs to be revised. The new plan is to attempt to input the desired filename '2023_01_26_wise_yacht' directly into the focused text field. It's possible that inputting new text might overwrite the existing text, or it might append to it. If it appends, further steps will be needed to correct the filename.

This field is currently displaying \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to select the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to delete the current text and input the desired filename. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'my_note\\' text field at [402, 154] did not select the text field as intended. Instead, an Android system error dialog titled \"com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\" appeared. This dialog prevents interaction with the underlying \"Create new file\" dialog. The action was a failure in terms of progressing the active subgoal, as an external error interrupted the intended workflow. The immediate next step is to dismiss this error dialog.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Close app\\' button in the error dialog. The \\'Close app\\' button is currently visible and enabled. This action is expected to dismiss the error dialog and allow interaction with the underlying \\'Create new file\\' dialog. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Close app\\' on the error dialog was successful. The error dialog disappeared, and the underlying \\'Create new file\\' dialog is now visible and accessible. This action brought the agent back on track to complete the active subgoal of setting the filename.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[396,154],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'my_note\\' (approximate coordinates [396, 154]) in the \\'Name\\' field. This field is currently displaying \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to select the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to delete the current text and input the desired filename. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'my_note\\' text field at [396, 154] was successful. The text field is now selected and focused, and the virtual keyboard (indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\') has appeared. This allows for text input into the filename field. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of setting the filename.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the focused filename field. The filename field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to clear the text field, allowing for the input of the new filename. Actual Outcome: The \\'DELETE_TEXT\\' action failed to remove the text \\'my_note\\' from the filename field. The field still contains \\'my_note\\', the keyboard is active, and the \\'Create new file\\' dialog is unchanged. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To recover, the text needs to be deleted using an alternative method, such as sending multiple `KEYCODE_DEL` events, before the correct filename can be input.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a \\'KEYCODE_DEL\\' keyevent to delete one character from the focused filename field. The filename field currently contains \\'my_note\\' and is focused. This action is the first of seven planned \\'KEYCODE_DEL\\' events to clear the field. It is expected to delete the last character \\'e\\' from \\'my_note\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of sending a `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevent failed to delete any character from the filename field. The text \\'my_note\\' is still present in the field. The keyboard remains active. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. Both `DELETE_TEXT` and `KEYCODE_DEL` have proven ineffective for clearing this text field so far.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[402,154],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'my_note\\' (coordinates [402, 154]) in the \\'Name\\' field. This field is currently displaying \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to select the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to delete the current text and input the desired filename. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'my_note\\' text field at [402, 154] did not select the text field as intended. Instead, an Android system error dialog titled \"com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\" appeared. This dialog prevents interaction with the underlying \"Create new file\" dialog. The action was a failure in terms of progressing the active subgoal, as an external error interrupted the intended workflow. The immediate next step is to dismiss this error dialog.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Close app\\' button in the error dialog. The \\'Close app\\' button is currently visible and enabled. This action is expected to dismiss the error dialog and allow interaction with the underlying \\'Create new file\\' dialog. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Close app\\' on the error dialog was successful. The error dialog disappeared, and the underlying \\'Create new file\\' dialog is now visible and accessible. This action brought the agent back on track to complete the active subgoal of setting the filename.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[396,154],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'my_note\\' (approximate coordinates [396, 154]) in the \\'Name\\' field. This field is currently displaying \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to select the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to delete the current text and input the desired filename. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'my_note\\' text field at [396, 154] was successful. The text field is now selected and focused, and the virtual keyboard (indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\') has appeared. This allows for text input into the filename field. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of setting the filename.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the focused filename field. The filename field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to clear the text field, allowing for the input of the new filename. Actual Outcome: The \\'DELETE_TEXT\\' action failed to remove the text \\'my_note\\' from the filename field. The field still contains \\'my_note\\', the keyboard is active, and the \\'Create new file\\' dialog is unchanged. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To recover, the text needs to be deleted using an alternative method, such as sending multiple `KEYCODE_DEL` events, before the correct filename can be input.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a \\'KEYCODE_DEL\\' keyevent to delete one character from the focused filename field. The filename field currently contains \\'my_note\\' and is focused. This action is the first of seven planned \\'KEYCODE_DEL\\' events to clear the field. It is expected to delete the last character \\'e\\' from \\'my_note\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of sending a `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevent failed to delete any character from the filename field. The text \\'my_note\\' is still present in the field. The keyboard remains active. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. Both `DELETE_TEXT` and `KEYCODE_DEL` have proven ineffective for clearing this text field so far.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 8: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"2023_01_26_wise_yacht\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\' into the focused filename field. The field currently contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to replace \\'my_note\\' with \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\' or append to it. The desired outcome is for the field to contain \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main screen is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right.

Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Close app\\' on the error dialog was successful. The error dialog disappeared, and the underlying \\'Create new file\\' dialog is now visible and accessible. This action brought the agent back on track to complete the active subgoal of setting the filename.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[396,154],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'my_note\\' (approximate coordinates [396, 154]) in the \\'Name\\' field. This field is currently displaying \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to select the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to delete the current text and input the desired filename. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'my_note\\' text field at [396, 154] was successful. The text field is now selected and focused, and the virtual keyboard (indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\') has appeared. This allows for text input into the filename field. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of setting the filename.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the focused filename field. The filename field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to clear the text field, allowing for the input of the new filename. Actual Outcome: The \\'DELETE_TEXT\\' action failed to remove the text \\'my_note\\' from the filename field. The field still contains \\'my_note\\', the keyboard is active, and the \\'Create new file\\' dialog is unchanged. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To recover, the text needs to be deleted using an alternative method, such as sending multiple `KEYCODE_DEL` events, before the correct filename can be input.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a \\'KEYCODE_DEL\\' keyevent to delete one character from the focused filename field. The filename field currently contains \\'my_note\\' and is focused. This action is the first of seven planned \\'KEYCODE_DEL\\' events to clear the field. It is expected to delete the last character \\'e\\' from \\'my_note\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of sending a `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevent failed to delete any character from the filename field. The text \\'my_note\\' is still present in the field. The keyboard remains active. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. Both `DELETE_TEXT` and `KEYCODE_DEL` have proven ineffective for clearing this text field so far.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"2023_01_26_wise_yacht\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\' into the focused filename field. The field currently contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to replace \\'my_note\\' with \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\' or append to it. The desired outcome is for the field to contain \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\' into the filename field was successful. The text field now contains \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\', replacing the previous \\'my_note\\'. The \\'Create new file\\' dialog remains open, and the virtual keyboard is still active. This action has brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal, as the filename is now correctly set. The next step is to confirm the filename.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Close app\\' button in the error dialog. The \\'Close app\\' button is currently visible and enabled. This action is expected to dismiss the error dialog and allow interaction with the underlying \\'Create new file\\' dialog. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Close app\\' on the error dialog was successful. The error dialog disappeared, and the underlying \\'Create new file\\' dialog is now visible and accessible. This action brought the agent back on track to complete the active subgoal of setting the filename.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[396,154],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'my_note\\' (approximate coordinates [396, 154]) in the \\'Name\\' field. This field is currently displaying \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to select the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to delete the current text and input the desired filename. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'my_note\\' text field at [396, 154] was successful. The text field is now selected and focused, and the virtual keyboard (indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\') has appeared. This allows for text input into the filename field. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of setting the filename.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the focused filename field. The filename field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to clear the text field, allowing for the input of the new filename. Actual Outcome: The \\'DELETE_TEXT\\' action failed to remove the text \\'my_note\\' from the filename field. The field still contains \\'my_note\\', the keyboard is active, and the \\'Create new file\\' dialog is unchanged. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To recover, the text needs to be deleted using an alternative method, such as sending multiple `KEYCODE_DEL` events, before the correct filename can be input.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a \\'KEYCODE_DEL\\' keyevent to delete one character from the focused filename field. The filename field currently contains \\'my_note\\' and is focused. This action is the first of seven planned \\'KEYCODE_DEL\\' events to clear the field. It is expected to delete the last character \\'e\\' from \\'my_note\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of sending a `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevent failed to delete any character from the filename field. The text \\'my_note\\' is still present in the field. The keyboard remains active. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. Both `DELETE_TEXT` and `KEYCODE_DEL` have proven ineffective for clearing this text field so far.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"2023_01_26_wise_yacht\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\' into the focused filename field. The field currently contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to replace \\'my_note\\' with \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\' or append to it. The desired outcome is for the field to contain \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\' into the filename field was successful. The text field now contains \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\', replacing the previous \\'my_note\\'. The \\'Create new file\\' dialog remains open, and the virtual keyboard is still active. This action has brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal, as the filename is now correctly set. The next step is to confirm the filename.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 9: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[610,855],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button to confirm the filename.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[396,154],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'my_note\\' (approximate coordinates [396, 154]) in the \\'Name\\' field. This field is currently displaying \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to select the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to delete the current text and input the desired filename. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'my_note\\' text field at [396, 154] was successful. The text field is now selected and focused, and the virtual keyboard (indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\') has appeared. This allows for text input into the filename field. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of setting the filename.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the focused filename field. The filename field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to clear the text field, allowing for the input of the new filename. Actual Outcome: The \\'DELETE_TEXT\\' action failed to remove the text \\'my_note\\' from the filename field. The field still contains \\'my_note\\', the keyboard is active, and the \\'Create new file\\' dialog is unchanged. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To recover, the text needs to be deleted using an alternative method, such as sending multiple `KEYCODE_DEL` events, before the correct filename can be input.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a \\'KEYCODE_DEL\\' keyevent to delete one character from the focused filename field. The filename field currently contains \\'my_note\\' and is focused. This action is the first of seven planned \\'KEYCODE_DEL\\' events to clear the field. It is expected to delete the last character \\'e\\' from \\'my_note\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of sending a `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevent failed to delete any character from the filename field. The text \\'my_note\\' is still present in the field. The keyboard remains active. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. Both `DELETE_TEXT` and `KEYCODE_DEL` have proven ineffective for clearing this text field so far.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"2023_01_26_wise_yacht\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\' into the focused filename field. The field currently contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to replace \\'my_note\\' with \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\' or append to it. The desired outcome is for the field to contain \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\' into the filename field was successful. The text field now contains \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\', replacing the previous \\'my_note\\'. The \\'Create new file\\' dialog remains open, and the virtual keyboard is still active. This action has brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal, as the filename is now correctly set. The next step is to confirm the filename.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[610,855],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button to confirm the filename. The \\'OK\\' button is visible and enabled. This action is expected to close the \\'Create new file\\' dialog and open the new note for editing. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'OK\\' button at [610, 855] was successful. The \\'Create new file\\' dialog closed, and the Markor app opened a new note with the filename \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht.md\\' in the editor view. The screen now displays an empty text area, which is focused and ready for content input. This action completed Subgoal 3 and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[396,154],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'my_note\\' (approximate coordinates [396, 154]) in the \\'Name\\' field. This field is currently displaying \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to select the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to delete the current text and input the desired filename. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'my_note\\' text field at [396, 154] was successful. The text field is now selected and focused, and the virtual keyboard (indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\') has appeared. This allows for text input into the filename field. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of setting the filename.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the focused filename field. The filename field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to clear the text field, allowing for the input of the new filename. Actual Outcome: The \\'DELETE_TEXT\\' action failed to remove the text \\'my_note\\' from the filename field. The field still contains \\'my_note\\', the keyboard is active, and the \\'Create new file\\' dialog is unchanged. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To recover, the text needs to be deleted using an alternative method, such as sending multiple `KEYCODE_DEL` events, before the correct filename can be input.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a \\'KEYCODE_DEL\\' keyevent to delete one character from the focused filename field. The filename field currently contains \\'my_note\\' and is focused. This action is the first of seven planned \\'KEYCODE_DEL\\' events to clear the field. It is expected to delete the last character \\'e\\' from \\'my_note\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of sending a `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevent failed to delete any character from the filename field. The text \\'my_note\\' is still present in the field. The keyboard remains active. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. Both `DELETE_TEXT` and `KEYCODE_DEL` have proven ineffective for clearing this text field so far.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"2023_01_26_wise_yacht\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\' into the focused filename field. The field currently contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to replace \\'my_note\\' with \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\' or append to it. The desired outcome is for the field to contain \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\' into the filename field was successful. The text field now contains \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\', replacing the previous \\'my_note\\'. The \\'Create new file\\' dialog remains open, and the virtual keyboard is still active. This action has brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal, as the filename is now correctly set. The next step is to confirm the filename.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[610,855],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button to confirm the filename. The \\'OK\\' button is visible and enabled. This action is expected to close the \\'Create new file\\' dialog and open the new note for editing. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'OK\\' button at [610, 855] was successful. The \\'Create new file\\' dialog closed, and the Markor app opened a new note with the filename \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht.md\\' in the editor view. The screen now displays an empty text area, which is focused and ready for content input. This action completed Subgoal 3 and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 10: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Ignorance is bliss.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Ignorance is bliss.\\' into the focused main content area of the note. The text area is currently empty and focused. This action is expected to populate the text area with the specified content. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main screen is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000.

Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the focused filename field. The filename field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to clear the text field, allowing for the input of the new filename. Actual Outcome: The \\'DELETE_TEXT\\' action failed to remove the text \\'my_note\\' from the filename field. The field still contains \\'my_note\\', the keyboard is active, and the \\'Create new file\\' dialog is unchanged. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To recover, the text needs to be deleted using an alternative method, such as sending multiple `KEYCODE_DEL` events, before the correct filename can be input.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a \\'KEYCODE_DEL\\' keyevent to delete one character from the focused filename field. The filename field currently contains \\'my_note\\' and is focused. This action is the first of seven planned \\'KEYCODE_DEL\\' events to clear the field. It is expected to delete the last character \\'e\\' from \\'my_note\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of sending a `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevent failed to delete any character from the filename field. The text \\'my_note\\' is still present in the field. The keyboard remains active. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. Both `DELETE_TEXT` and `KEYCODE_DEL` have proven ineffective for clearing this text field so far.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"2023_01_26_wise_yacht\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\' into the focused filename field. The field currently contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to replace \\'my_note\\' with \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\' or append to it. The desired outcome is for the field to contain \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\' into the filename field was successful. The text field now contains \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\', replacing the previous \\'my_note\\'. The \\'Create new file\\' dialog remains open, and the virtual keyboard is still active. This action has brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal, as the filename is now correctly set. The next step is to confirm the filename.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[610,855],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button to confirm the filename. The \\'OK\\' button is visible and enabled. This action is expected to close the \\'Create new file\\' dialog and open the new note for editing. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'OK\\' button at [610, 855] was successful. The \\'Create new file\\' dialog closed, and the Markor app opened a new note with the filename \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht.md\\' in the editor view. The screen now displays an empty text area, which is focused and ready for content input. This action completed Subgoal 3 and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Ignorance is bliss.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Ignorance is bliss.\\' into the focused main content area of the note. The text area is currently empty and focused. This action is expected to populate the text area with the specified content. Actual Outcome: The `INPUT_TEXT` action successfully entered \"Ignorance is bliss.\" into the main content area of the note. The screen now displays this text in the editor, and the text field is still focused with the cursor at the end of the entered text. This action has successfully completed Subgoal 4, as the required content is now in the note.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing.

The text you can edit is: \"Ignorance is bliss.\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider.

If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the focused filename field. The filename field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to clear the text field, allowing for the input of the new filename. Actual Outcome: The \\'DELETE_TEXT\\' action failed to remove the text \\'my_note\\' from the filename field. The field still contains \\'my_note\\', the keyboard is active, and the \\'Create new file\\' dialog is unchanged. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To recover, the text needs to be deleted using an alternative method, such as sending multiple `KEYCODE_DEL` events, before the correct filename can be input.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a \\'KEYCODE_DEL\\' keyevent to delete one character from the focused filename field. The filename field currently contains \\'my_note\\' and is focused. This action is the first of seven planned \\'KEYCODE_DEL\\' events to clear the field. It is expected to delete the last character \\'e\\' from \\'my_note\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of sending a `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevent failed to delete any character from the filename field. The text \\'my_note\\' is still present in the field. The keyboard remains active. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. Both `DELETE_TEXT` and `KEYCODE_DEL` have proven ineffective for clearing this text field so far.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"2023_01_26_wise_yacht\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\' into the focused filename field. The field currently contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to replace \\'my_note\\' with \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\' or append to it. The desired outcome is for the field to contain \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\' into the filename field was successful. The text field now contains \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\', replacing the previous \\'my_note\\'. The \\'Create new file\\' dialog remains open, and the virtual keyboard is still active. This action has brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal, as the filename is now correctly set. The next step is to confirm the filename.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[610,855],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button to confirm the filename. The \\'OK\\' button is visible and enabled. This action is expected to close the \\'Create new file\\' dialog and open the new note for editing. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'OK\\' button at [610, 855] was successful. The \\'Create new file\\' dialog closed, and the Markor app opened a new note with the filename \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht.md\\' in the editor view. The screen now displays an empty text area, which is focused and ready for content input. This action completed Subgoal 3 and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Ignorance is bliss.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Ignorance is bliss.\\' into the focused main content area of the note. The text area is currently empty and focused. This action is expected to populate the text area with the specified content. Actual Outcome: The `INPUT_TEXT` action successfully entered \"Ignorance is bliss.\" into the main content area of the note. The screen now displays this text in the editor, and the text field is still focused with the cursor at the end of the entered text. This action has successfully completed Subgoal 4, as the required content is now in the note.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 11: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[903,56],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkmark icon to save the note. The checkmark icon is located at the bottom left of the screen, within the toolbar. This action is expected to save the note and potentially close the editor or return to the main Markor screen. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main screen is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard.

The filename field currently contains \\'my_note\\' and is focused. This action is the first of seven planned \\'KEYCODE_DEL\\' events to clear the field. It is expected to delete the last character \\'e\\' from \\'my_note\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of sending a `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevent failed to delete any character from the filename field. The text \\'my_note\\' is still present in the field. The keyboard remains active. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. Both `DELETE_TEXT` and `KEYCODE_DEL` have proven ineffective for clearing this text field so far.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"2023_01_26_wise_yacht\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\' into the focused filename field. The field currently contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to replace \\'my_note\\' with \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\' or append to it. The desired outcome is for the field to contain \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\' into the filename field was successful. The text field now contains \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\', replacing the previous \\'my_note\\'. The \\'Create new file\\' dialog remains open, and the virtual keyboard is still active. This action has brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal, as the filename is now correctly set. The next step is to confirm the filename.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[610,855],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button to confirm the filename. The \\'OK\\' button is visible and enabled. This action is expected to close the \\'Create new file\\' dialog and open the new note for editing. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'OK\\' button at [610, 855] was successful. The \\'Create new file\\' dialog closed, and the Markor app opened a new note with the filename \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht.md\\' in the editor view. The screen now displays an empty text area, which is focused and ready for content input. This action completed Subgoal 3 and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Ignorance is bliss.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Ignorance is bliss.\\' into the focused main content area of the note. The text area is currently empty and focused. This action is expected to populate the text area with the specified content. Actual Outcome: The `INPUT_TEXT` action successfully entered \"Ignorance is bliss.\" into the main content area of the note. The screen now displays this text in the editor, and the text field is still focused with the cursor at the end of the entered text. This action has successfully completed Subgoal 4, as the required content is now in the note.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[903,56],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkmark icon to save the note. The checkmark icon is located at the bottom left of the screen, within the toolbar. This action is expected to save the note and potentially close the editor or return to the main Markor screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the checkmark icon at [903, 56] (which corresponds to the checkmark icon at the bottom left of the screen, coordinates in the action description seem to be for the top bar, but the visual red ring was on the bottom left checkmark) did not save the note. Instead, it modified the content of the note by prepending \\'- [ ] \\' to the existing text, effectively turning it into a to-do list item. The text changed from \"Ignorance is bliss.\" to \"- [ ] Ignorance is bliss.\". This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of saving the note; in fact, it altered the content undesirably. The note is not saved, and the content has been changed.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing.

The text you can edit is: \"- [ ] Ignorance is bliss.\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000.

The filename field currently contains \\'my_note\\' and is focused. This action is the first of seven planned \\'KEYCODE_DEL\\' events to clear the field. It is expected to delete the last character \\'e\\' from \\'my_note\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of sending a `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevent failed to delete any character from the filename field. The text \\'my_note\\' is still present in the field. The keyboard remains active. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. Both `DELETE_TEXT` and `KEYCODE_DEL` have proven ineffective for clearing this text field so far.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"2023_01_26_wise_yacht\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\' into the focused filename field. The field currently contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to replace \\'my_note\\' with \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\' or append to it. The desired outcome is for the field to contain \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\' into the filename field was successful. The text field now contains \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\', replacing the previous \\'my_note\\'. The \\'Create new file\\' dialog remains open, and the virtual keyboard is still active. This action has brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal, as the filename is now correctly set. The next step is to confirm the filename.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[610,855],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button to confirm the filename. The \\'OK\\' button is visible and enabled. This action is expected to close the \\'Create new file\\' dialog and open the new note for editing. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'OK\\' button at [610, 855] was successful. The \\'Create new file\\' dialog closed, and the Markor app opened a new note with the filename \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht.md\\' in the editor view. The screen now displays an empty text area, which is focused and ready for content input. This action completed Subgoal 3 and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Ignorance is bliss.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Ignorance is bliss.\\' into the focused main content area of the note. The text area is currently empty and focused. This action is expected to populate the text area with the specified content. Actual Outcome: The `INPUT_TEXT` action successfully entered \"Ignorance is bliss.\" into the main content area of the note. The screen now displays this text in the editor, and the text field is still focused with the cursor at the end of the entered text. This action has successfully completed Subgoal 4, as the required content is now in the note.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[903,56],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkmark icon to save the note. The checkmark icon is located at the bottom left of the screen, within the toolbar. This action is expected to save the note and potentially close the editor or return to the main Markor screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the checkmark icon at [903, 56] (which corresponds to the checkmark icon at the bottom left of the screen, coordinates in the action description seem to be for the top bar, but the visual red ring was on the bottom left checkmark) did not save the note. Instead, it modified the content of the note by prepending \\'- [ ] \\' to the existing text, effectively turning it into a to-do list item. The text changed from \"Ignorance is bliss.\" to \"- [ ] Ignorance is bliss.\". This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of saving the note; in fact, it altered the content undesirably. The note is not saved, and the content has been changed.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 12: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field. The field currently contains \\'- [ ] Ignorance is bliss.\\'. This action is expected to clear the text field, preparing it for the correct input. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main screen is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution.

The field currently contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to replace \\'my_note\\' with \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\' or append to it. The desired outcome is for the field to contain \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\' into the filename field was successful. The text field now contains \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\', replacing the previous \\'my_note\\'. The \\'Create new file\\' dialog remains open, and the virtual keyboard is still active. This action has brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal, as the filename is now correctly set. The next step is to confirm the filename.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[610,855],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button to confirm the filename. The \\'OK\\' button is visible and enabled. This action is expected to close the \\'Create new file\\' dialog and open the new note for editing. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'OK\\' button at [610, 855] was successful. The \\'Create new file\\' dialog closed, and the Markor app opened a new note with the filename \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht.md\\' in the editor view. The screen now displays an empty text area, which is focused and ready for content input. This action completed Subgoal 3 and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Ignorance is bliss.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Ignorance is bliss.\\' into the focused main content area of the note. The text area is currently empty and focused. This action is expected to populate the text area with the specified content. Actual Outcome: The `INPUT_TEXT` action successfully entered \"Ignorance is bliss.\" into the main content area of the note. The screen now displays this text in the editor, and the text field is still focused with the cursor at the end of the entered text. This action has successfully completed Subgoal 4, as the required content is now in the note.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[903,56],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkmark icon to save the note. The checkmark icon is located at the bottom left of the screen, within the toolbar. This action is expected to save the note and potentially close the editor or return to the main Markor screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the checkmark icon at [903, 56] (which corresponds to the checkmark icon at the bottom left of the screen, coordinates in the action description seem to be for the top bar, but the visual red ring was on the bottom left checkmark) did not save the note. Instead, it modified the content of the note by prepending \\'- [ ] \\' to the existing text, effectively turning it into a to-do list item. The text changed from \"Ignorance is bliss.\" to \"- [ ] Ignorance is bliss.\". This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of saving the note; in fact, it altered the content undesirably. The note is not saved, and the content has been changed.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field. The field currently contains \\'- [ ] Ignorance is bliss.\\'. This action is expected to clear the text field, preparing it for the correct input. Actual Outcome: The `DELETE_TEXT` action successfully removed all text from the focused editor field. The field, which previously contained \\'- [ ] Ignorance is bliss.\\', is now empty. This action corrected the error from the previous step and brought the agent closer to being able to save the note with the correct content. The next step is to input the correct content again.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 42, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.43\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 66, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [73, 34, 99, 419], \\'text\\': \\'2023_01_26_wi.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [887, 144, 916, 492], \\'text\\': \\'= B  I\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 653], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 908, 100, 985]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 591, 935, 703]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 480, 939, 581]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 619, 99, 701]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 823, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 521, 97, 604]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 716, 929, 816]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [879, 247, 927, 343]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [879, 123, 927, 231]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 715, 99, 798]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 811, 101, 897]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 358, 932, 464]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 951, 926, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 37, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 143, 36, 189]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 837, 928, 929]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 905, 37, 943]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [879, 7, 927, 106]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 423, 112, 509]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: NAF=\"true\", index=\"0\", text=\"\", resource-id=\"net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"net.gsantner.markor\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[0,275][1080,2102]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right.

The field currently contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to replace \\'my_note\\' with \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\' or append to it. The desired outcome is for the field to contain \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\' into the filename field was successful. The text field now contains \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht\\', replacing the previous \\'my_note\\'. The \\'Create new file\\' dialog remains open, and the virtual keyboard is still active. This action has brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal, as the filename is now correctly set. The next step is to confirm the filename.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[610,855],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button to confirm the filename. The \\'OK\\' button is visible and enabled. This action is expected to close the \\'Create new file\\' dialog and open the new note for editing. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'OK\\' button at [610, 855] was successful. The \\'Create new file\\' dialog closed, and the Markor app opened a new note with the filename \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht.md\\' in the editor view. The screen now displays an empty text area, which is focused and ready for content input. This action completed Subgoal 3 and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Ignorance is bliss.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Ignorance is bliss.\\' into the focused main content area of the note. The text area is currently empty and focused. This action is expected to populate the text area with the specified content. Actual Outcome: The `INPUT_TEXT` action successfully entered \"Ignorance is bliss.\" into the main content area of the note. The screen now displays this text in the editor, and the text field is still focused with the cursor at the end of the entered text. This action has successfully completed Subgoal 4, as the required content is now in the note.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[903,56],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkmark icon to save the note. The checkmark icon is located at the bottom left of the screen, within the toolbar. This action is expected to save the note and potentially close the editor or return to the main Markor screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the checkmark icon at [903, 56] (which corresponds to the checkmark icon at the bottom left of the screen, coordinates in the action description seem to be for the top bar, but the visual red ring was on the bottom left checkmark) did not save the note. Instead, it modified the content of the note by prepending \\'- [ ] \\' to the existing text, effectively turning it into a to-do list item. The text changed from \"Ignorance is bliss.\" to \"- [ ] Ignorance is bliss.\". This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of saving the note; in fact, it altered the content undesirably. The note is not saved, and the content has been changed.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field. The field currently contains \\'- [ ] Ignorance is bliss.\\'. This action is expected to clear the text field, preparing it for the correct input. Actual Outcome: The `DELETE_TEXT` action successfully removed all text from the focused editor field. The field, which previously contained \\'- [ ] Ignorance is bliss.\\', is now empty. This action corrected the error from the previous step and brought the agent closer to being able to save the note with the correct content. The next step is to input the correct content again.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 13: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Ignorance is bliss.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Ignorance is bliss.\\' into the currently focused empty text editor. This will restore the intended content of the note before attempting to save it again. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main screen is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17.

The \\'OK\\' button is visible and enabled. This action is expected to close the \\'Create new file\\' dialog and open the new note for editing. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'OK\\' button at [610, 855] was successful. The \\'Create new file\\' dialog closed, and the Markor app opened a new note with the filename \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht.md\\' in the editor view. The screen now displays an empty text area, which is focused and ready for content input. This action completed Subgoal 3 and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Ignorance is bliss.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Ignorance is bliss.\\' into the focused main content area of the note. The text area is currently empty and focused. This action is expected to populate the text area with the specified content. Actual Outcome: The `INPUT_TEXT` action successfully entered \"Ignorance is bliss.\" into the main content area of the note. The screen now displays this text in the editor, and the text field is still focused with the cursor at the end of the entered text. This action has successfully completed Subgoal 4, as the required content is now in the note.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[903,56],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkmark icon to save the note. The checkmark icon is located at the bottom left of the screen, within the toolbar. This action is expected to save the note and potentially close the editor or return to the main Markor screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the checkmark icon at [903, 56] (which corresponds to the checkmark icon at the bottom left of the screen, coordinates in the action description seem to be for the top bar, but the visual red ring was on the bottom left checkmark) did not save the note. Instead, it modified the content of the note by prepending \\'- [ ] \\' to the existing text, effectively turning it into a to-do list item. The text changed from \"Ignorance is bliss.\" to \"- [ ] Ignorance is bliss.\". This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of saving the note; in fact, it altered the content undesirably. The note is not saved, and the content has been changed.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field. The field currently contains \\'- [ ] Ignorance is bliss.\\'. This action is expected to clear the text field, preparing it for the correct input. Actual Outcome: The `DELETE_TEXT` action successfully removed all text from the focused editor field. The field, which previously contained \\'- [ ] Ignorance is bliss.\\', is now empty. This action corrected the error from the previous step and brought the agent closer to being able to save the note with the correct content. The next step is to input the correct content again.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Ignorance is bliss.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Ignorance is bliss.\\' into the currently focused empty text editor. This will restore the intended content of the note before attempting to save it again. Actual Outcome: The `INPUT_TEXT` action successfully entered \"Ignorance is bliss.\" into the main content area of the note. The screen now displays this text in the editor, and the text field is still focused with the cursor at the end of the entered text. This action has successfully restored the correct content to the note, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of saving the note.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"Ignorance is bliss.\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[610,855],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button to confirm the filename. The \\'OK\\' button is visible and enabled. This action is expected to close the \\'Create new file\\' dialog and open the new note for editing. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'OK\\' button at [610, 855] was successful. The \\'Create new file\\' dialog closed, and the Markor app opened a new note with the filename \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht.md\\' in the editor view. The screen now displays an empty text area, which is focused and ready for content input. This action completed Subgoal 3 and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Ignorance is bliss.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Ignorance is bliss.\\' into the focused main content area of the note. The text area is currently empty and focused. This action is expected to populate the text area with the specified content. Actual Outcome: The `INPUT_TEXT` action successfully entered \"Ignorance is bliss.\" into the main content area of the note. The screen now displays this text in the editor, and the text field is still focused with the cursor at the end of the entered text. This action has successfully completed Subgoal 4, as the required content is now in the note.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[903,56],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkmark icon to save the note. The checkmark icon is located at the bottom left of the screen, within the toolbar. This action is expected to save the note and potentially close the editor or return to the main Markor screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the checkmark icon at [903, 56] (which corresponds to the checkmark icon at the bottom left of the screen, coordinates in the action description seem to be for the top bar, but the visual red ring was on the bottom left checkmark) did not save the note. Instead, it modified the content of the note by prepending \\'- [ ] \\' to the existing text, effectively turning it into a to-do list item. The text changed from \"Ignorance is bliss.\" to \"- [ ] Ignorance is bliss.\". This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of saving the note; in fact, it altered the content undesirably. The note is not saved, and the content has been changed.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field. The field currently contains \\'- [ ] Ignorance is bliss.\\'. This action is expected to clear the text field, preparing it for the correct input. Actual Outcome: The `DELETE_TEXT` action successfully removed all text from the focused editor field. The field, which previously contained \\'- [ ] Ignorance is bliss.\\', is now empty. This action corrected the error from the previous step and brought the agent closer to being able to save the note with the correct content. The next step is to input the correct content again.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Ignorance is bliss.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Ignorance is bliss.\\' into the currently focused empty text editor. This will restore the intended content of the note before attempting to save it again. Actual Outcome: The `INPUT_TEXT` action successfully entered \"Ignorance is bliss.\" into the main content area of the note. The screen now displays this text in the editor, and the text field is still focused with the cursor at the end of the entered text. This action has successfully restored the correct content to the note, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of saving the note.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 14: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (coordinates approximately [84, 946]). This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a context menu which might contain a \\'Save\\' option for the note. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main screen is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000.

The text area is currently empty and focused. This action is expected to populate the text area with the specified content. Actual Outcome: The `INPUT_TEXT` action successfully entered \"Ignorance is bliss.\" into the main content area of the note. The screen now displays this text in the editor, and the text field is still focused with the cursor at the end of the entered text. This action has successfully completed Subgoal 4, as the required content is now in the note.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

The checkmark icon is located at the bottom left of the screen, within the toolbar. This action is expected to save the note and potentially close the editor or return to the main Markor screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the checkmark icon at [903, 56] (which corresponds to the checkmark icon at the bottom left of the screen, coordinates in the action description seem to be for the top bar, but the visual red ring was on the bottom left checkmark) did not save the note. Instead, it modified the content of the note by prepending \\'- [ ] \\' to the existing text, effectively turning it into a to-do list item. The text changed from \"Ignorance is bliss.\" to \"- [ ] Ignorance is bliss.\". This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of saving the note; in fact, it altered the content undesirably. The note is not saved, and the content has been changed.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field. The field currently contains \\'- [ ] Ignorance is bliss.\\'. This action is expected to clear the text field, preparing it for the correct input. Actual Outcome: The `DELETE_TEXT` action successfully removed all text from the focused editor field. The field, which previously contained \\'- [ ] Ignorance is bliss.\\', is now empty. This action corrected the error from the previous step and brought the agent closer to being able to save the note with the correct content. The next step is to input the correct content again.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Ignorance is bliss.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Ignorance is bliss.\\' into the currently focused empty text editor. This will restore the intended content of the note before attempting to save it again. Actual Outcome: The `INPUT_TEXT` action successfully entered \"Ignorance is bliss.\" into the main content area of the note. The screen now displays this text in the editor, and the text field is still focused with the cursor at the end of the entered text. This action has successfully restored the correct content to the note, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of saving the note.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (coordinates approximately [84, 946]). This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a context menu which might contain a \\'Save\\' option for the note. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [84, 946] (top right) was successful. A context menu appeared on the right side of the screen with the options: \\'File settings\\', \\'Share\\', \\'Tools\\', \\'Info\\', and \\'Reload\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal of saving the note by revealing potential options for saving.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing.

Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text area is currently empty and focused. This action is expected to populate the text area with the specified content. Actual Outcome: The `INPUT_TEXT` action successfully entered \"Ignorance is bliss.\" into the main content area of the note. The screen now displays this text in the editor, and the text field is still focused with the cursor at the end of the entered text. This action has successfully completed Subgoal 4, as the required content is now in the note.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[903,56],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkmark icon to save the note. The checkmark icon is located at the bottom left of the screen, within the toolbar. This action is expected to save the note and potentially close the editor or return to the main Markor screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the checkmark icon at [903, 56] (which corresponds to the checkmark icon at the bottom left of the screen, coordinates in the action description seem to be for the top bar, but the visual red ring was on the bottom left checkmark) did not save the note. Instead, it modified the content of the note by prepending \\'- [ ] \\' to the existing text, effectively turning it into a to-do list item. The text changed from \"Ignorance is bliss.\" to \"- [ ] Ignorance is bliss.\". This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of saving the note; in fact, it altered the content undesirably. The note is not saved, and the content has been changed.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field. The field currently contains \\'- [ ] Ignorance is bliss.\\'. This action is expected to clear the text field, preparing it for the correct input. Actual Outcome: The `DELETE_TEXT` action successfully removed all text from the focused editor field. The field, which previously contained \\'- [ ] Ignorance is bliss.\\', is now empty. This action corrected the error from the previous step and brought the agent closer to being able to save the note with the correct content. The next step is to input the correct content again.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Ignorance is bliss.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Ignorance is bliss.\\' into the currently focused empty text editor. This will restore the intended content of the note before attempting to save it again. Actual Outcome: The `INPUT_TEXT` action successfully entered \"Ignorance is bliss.\" into the main content area of the note. The screen now displays this text in the editor, and the text field is still focused with the cursor at the end of the entered text. This action has successfully restored the correct content to the note, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of saving the note.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (coordinates approximately [84, 946]). This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a context menu which might contain a \\'Save\\' option for the note. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [84, 946] (top right) was successful. A context menu appeared on the right side of the screen with the options: \\'File settings\\', \\'Share\\', \\'Tools\\', \\'Info\\', and \\'Reload\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal of saving the note by revealing potential options for saving.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 15: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,715],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'File settings\\' option in the currently open menu. The \\'File settings\\' option is the first item in the menu. This action is expected to open a submenu or a new screen related to file settings, where a \\'Save\\' option might be present. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main screen is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[903,56],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkmark icon to save the note. The checkmark icon is located at the bottom left of the screen, within the toolbar. This action is expected to save the note and potentially close the editor or return to the main Markor screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the checkmark icon at [903, 56] (which corresponds to the checkmark icon at the bottom left of the screen, coordinates in the action description seem to be for the top bar, but the visual red ring was on the bottom left checkmark) did not save the note. Instead, it modified the content of the note by prepending \\'- [ ] \\' to the existing text, effectively turning it into a to-do list item. The text changed from \"Ignorance is bliss.\" to \"- [ ] Ignorance is bliss.\". This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of saving the note; in fact, it altered the content undesirably. The note is not saved, and the content has been changed.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field. The field currently contains \\'- [ ] Ignorance is bliss.\\'. This action is expected to clear the text field, preparing it for the correct input. Actual Outcome: The `DELETE_TEXT` action successfully removed all text from the focused editor field. The field, which previously contained \\'- [ ] Ignorance is bliss.\\', is now empty. This action corrected the error from the previous step and brought the agent closer to being able to save the note with the correct content. The next step is to input the correct content again.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Ignorance is bliss.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Ignorance is bliss.\\' into the currently focused empty text editor. This will restore the intended content of the note before attempting to save it again. Actual Outcome: The `INPUT_TEXT` action successfully entered \"Ignorance is bliss.\" into the main content area of the note. The screen now displays this text in the editor, and the text field is still focused with the cursor at the end of the entered text. This action has successfully restored the correct content to the note, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of saving the note.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (coordinates approximately [84, 946]). This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a context menu which might contain a \\'Save\\' option for the note. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [84, 946] (top right) was successful. A context menu appeared on the right side of the screen with the options: \\'File settings\\', \\'Share\\', \\'Tools\\', \\'Info\\', and \\'Reload\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal of saving the note by revealing potential options for saving.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,715],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'File settings\\' option in the currently open menu. The \\'File settings\\' option is the first item in the menu. This action is expected to open a submenu or a new screen related to file settings, where a \\'Save\\' option might be present. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'File settings\\' was successful. It opened a new submenu titled \\'File settings\\' which displays options: \\'Wrap words\\', \\'Syntax highlighting\\', \\'Auto-format\\', \\'Font Size\\', and \\'Format\\'. No \\'Save\\' option is visible in this submenu. This action helped explore menu options but did not directly lead to saving the note. The agent is closer to completing the subgoal by systematically checking available options. The next step is to navigate back from this submenu to continue searching for a save mechanism.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 41, 36, 138], \\'text\\': \\'15.45\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 66, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 65, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [73, 34, 99, 410], \\'text\\': \\'2023_01_26_wi.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [73, 488, 97, 690], \\'text\\': \\'File settings\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [134, 34, 155, 337], \\'text\\': \\'Ignorance is bliss |\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [125, 549, 150, 767], \\'text\\': \\'Wrap words\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [179, 550, 203, 889], \\'text\\': \\'Syntax highlighting\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [232, 552, 251, 772], \\'text\\': \\'Auto-format\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [283, 482, 305, 721], \\'text\\': \\'TT Font Size\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [331, 471, 360, 686], \\'text\\': \\'fi Format\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [887, 142, 916, 492], \\'text\\': \\'= B I\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 653], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [164, 444, 216, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [216, 450, 269, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [268, 450, 321, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [110, 447, 164, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 474, 948, 590]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 712, 924, 819]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 245, 923, 341]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 950, 922, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [884, 599, 921, 695]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 354, 944, 467]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 122, 923, 232]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 836, 923, 930]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 455, 111, 998]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 821, 36, 901]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 8, 924, 106]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 905, 35, 943]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 196, 37, 242]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[903,56],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkmark icon to save the note. The checkmark icon is located at the bottom left of the screen, within the toolbar. This action is expected to save the note and potentially close the editor or return to the main Markor screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the checkmark icon at [903, 56] (which corresponds to the checkmark icon at the bottom left of the screen, coordinates in the action description seem to be for the top bar, but the visual red ring was on the bottom left checkmark) did not save the note. Instead, it modified the content of the note by prepending \\'- [ ] \\' to the existing text, effectively turning it into a to-do list item. The text changed from \"Ignorance is bliss.\" to \"- [ ] Ignorance is bliss.\". This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of saving the note; in fact, it altered the content undesirably. The note is not saved, and the content has been changed.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field. The field currently contains \\'- [ ] Ignorance is bliss.\\'. This action is expected to clear the text field, preparing it for the correct input. Actual Outcome: The `DELETE_TEXT` action successfully removed all text from the focused editor field. The field, which previously contained \\'- [ ] Ignorance is bliss.\\', is now empty. This action corrected the error from the previous step and brought the agent closer to being able to save the note with the correct content. The next step is to input the correct content again.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Ignorance is bliss.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Ignorance is bliss.\\' into the currently focused empty text editor. This will restore the intended content of the note before attempting to save it again. Actual Outcome: The `INPUT_TEXT` action successfully entered \"Ignorance is bliss.\" into the main content area of the note. The screen now displays this text in the editor, and the text field is still focused with the cursor at the end of the entered text. This action has successfully restored the correct content to the note, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of saving the note.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (coordinates approximately [84, 946]). This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a context menu which might contain a \\'Save\\' option for the note. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [84, 946] (top right) was successful. A context menu appeared on the right side of the screen with the options: \\'File settings\\', \\'Share\\', \\'Tools\\', \\'Info\\', and \\'Reload\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal of saving the note by revealing potential options for saving.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,715],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'File settings\\' option in the currently open menu. The \\'File settings\\' option is the first item in the menu. This action is expected to open a submenu or a new screen related to file settings, where a \\'Save\\' option might be present. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'File settings\\' was successful. It opened a new submenu titled \\'File settings\\' which displays options: \\'Wrap words\\', \\'Syntax highlighting\\', \\'Auto-format\\', \\'Font Size\\', and \\'Format\\'. No \\'Save\\' option is visible in this submenu. This action helped explore menu options but did not directly lead to saving the note. The agent is closer to completing the subgoal by systematically checking available options. The next step is to navigate back from this submenu to continue searching for a save mechanism.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 16: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,465],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located to the left of the \\'File settings\\' title in the submenu. This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to close the \\'File settings\\' submenu and return to the previous menu (the one with \\'Share\\', \\'Tools\\', \\'Info\\', \\'Reload\\'). The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main screen is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard.

Actual Outcome: The `DELETE_TEXT` action successfully removed all text from the focused editor field. The field, which previously contained \\'- [ ] Ignorance is bliss.\\', is now empty. This action corrected the error from the previous step and brought the agent closer to being able to save the note with the correct content. The next step is to input the correct content again.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Ignorance is bliss.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Ignorance is bliss.\\' into the currently focused empty text editor. This will restore the intended content of the note before attempting to save it again. Actual Outcome: The `INPUT_TEXT` action successfully entered \"Ignorance is bliss.\" into the main content area of the note. The screen now displays this text in the editor, and the text field is still focused with the cursor at the end of the entered text. This action has successfully restored the correct content to the note, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of saving the note.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (coordinates approximately [84, 946]). This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a context menu which might contain a \\'Save\\' option for the note. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [84, 946] (top right) was successful. A context menu appeared on the right side of the screen with the options: \\'File settings\\', \\'Share\\', \\'Tools\\', \\'Info\\', and \\'Reload\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal of saving the note by revealing potential options for saving.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,715],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'File settings\\' option in the currently open menu. The \\'File settings\\' option is the first item in the menu. This action is expected to open a submenu or a new screen related to file settings, where a \\'Save\\' option might be present. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'File settings\\' was successful. It opened a new submenu titled \\'File settings\\' which displays options: \\'Wrap words\\', \\'Syntax highlighting\\', \\'Auto-format\\', \\'Font Size\\', and \\'Format\\'. No \\'Save\\' option is visible in this submenu. This action helped explore menu options but did not directly lead to saving the note. The agent is closer to completing the subgoal by systematically checking available options. The next step is to navigate back from this submenu to continue searching for a save mechanism.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,465],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located to the left of the \\'File settings\\' title in the submenu. This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to close the \\'File settings\\' submenu and return to the previous menu (the one with \\'Share\\', \\'Tools\\', \\'Info\\', \\'Reload\\'). Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'File settings\\' at [85, 465] (which corresponds to the title of the already open \\'File settings\\' submenu) did not result in any change to the screen. The \\'File settings\\' submenu remains open. This action did not bring the agent closer to saving the note because it did not navigate away from the current submenu. The previous assumption that a back arrow was present was incorrect.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 42, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.46\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 66, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 66, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 65, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [73, 34, 99, 410], \\'text\\': \\'2023_01_26_wi.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [73, 488, 97, 690], \\'text\\': \\'File settings\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [134, 34, 155, 337], \\'text\\': \\'Ignorance is bliss |\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [125, 549, 150, 767], \\'text\\': \\'Wrap words\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [179, 550, 203, 889], \\'text\\': \\'Syntax highlighting\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [232, 552, 251, 772], \\'text\\': \\'Auto-format\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [283, 482, 305, 721], \\'text\\': \\'TT Font Size\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [331, 471, 360, 686], \\'text\\': \\'fi Format\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [887, 142, 916, 492], \\'text\\': \\'= B I\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 653], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [164, 444, 216, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [216, 449, 269, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [268, 450, 321, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [110, 447, 164, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 474, 948, 589]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 246, 923, 341]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 712, 924, 819]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 950, 922, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 449, 111, 999]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [884, 600, 921, 694]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 355, 944, 466]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 124, 923, 231]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 836, 923, 930]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 821, 36, 901]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 8, 925, 106]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 905, 35, 943]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 196, 37, 241]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right.

If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field. The field currently contains \\'- [ ] Ignorance is bliss.\\'. This action is expected to clear the text field, preparing it for the correct input. Actual Outcome: The `DELETE_TEXT` action successfully removed all text from the focused editor field. The field, which previously contained \\'- [ ] Ignorance is bliss.\\', is now empty. This action corrected the error from the previous step and brought the agent closer to being able to save the note with the correct content. The next step is to input the correct content again.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Ignorance is bliss.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Ignorance is bliss.\\' into the currently focused empty text editor. This will restore the intended content of the note before attempting to save it again. Actual Outcome: The `INPUT_TEXT` action successfully entered \"Ignorance is bliss.\" into the main content area of the note. The screen now displays this text in the editor, and the text field is still focused with the cursor at the end of the entered text. This action has successfully restored the correct content to the note, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of saving the note.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (coordinates approximately [84, 946]). This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a context menu which might contain a \\'Save\\' option for the note. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [84, 946] (top right) was successful. A context menu appeared on the right side of the screen with the options: \\'File settings\\', \\'Share\\', \\'Tools\\', \\'Info\\', and \\'Reload\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal of saving the note by revealing potential options for saving.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,715],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'File settings\\' option in the currently open menu. The \\'File settings\\' option is the first item in the menu. This action is expected to open a submenu or a new screen related to file settings, where a \\'Save\\' option might be present. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'File settings\\' was successful. It opened a new submenu titled \\'File settings\\' which displays options: \\'Wrap words\\', \\'Syntax highlighting\\', \\'Auto-format\\', \\'Font Size\\', and \\'Format\\'. No \\'Save\\' option is visible in this submenu. This action helped explore menu options but did not directly lead to saving the note. The agent is closer to completing the subgoal by systematically checking available options. The next step is to navigate back from this submenu to continue searching for a save mechanism.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,465],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located to the left of the \\'File settings\\' title in the submenu. This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to close the \\'File settings\\' submenu and return to the previous menu (the one with \\'Share\\', \\'Tools\\', \\'Info\\', \\'Reload\\'). Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'File settings\\' at [85, 465] (which corresponds to the title of the already open \\'File settings\\' submenu) did not result in any change to the screen. The \\'File settings\\' submenu remains open. This action did not bring the agent closer to saving the note because it did not navigate away from the current submenu. The previous assumption that a back arrow was present was incorrect.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 17: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button. The \\'File settings\\' submenu is currently open. This action is expected to close the \\'File settings\\' submenu and return to the previous menu, which contained options like \\'Share\\', \\'Tools\\', \\'Info\\', and \\'Reload\\'. This will allow further exploration for a \\'Save\\' option. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main screen is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16.

The \\'File settings\\' option is the first item in the menu. This action is expected to open a submenu or a new screen related to file settings, where a \\'Save\\' option might be present. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'File settings\\' was successful. It opened a new submenu titled \\'File settings\\' which displays options: \\'Wrap words\\', \\'Syntax highlighting\\', \\'Auto-format\\', \\'Font Size\\', and \\'Format\\'. No \\'Save\\' option is visible in this submenu. This action helped explore menu options but did not directly lead to saving the note. The agent is closer to completing the subgoal by systematically checking available options. The next step is to navigate back from this submenu to continue searching for a save mechanism.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,465],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located to the left of the \\'File settings\\' title in the submenu. This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to close the \\'File settings\\' submenu and return to the previous menu (the one with \\'Share\\', \\'Tools\\', \\'Info\\', \\'Reload\\'). Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'File settings\\' at [85, 465] (which corresponds to the title of the already open \\'File settings\\' submenu) did not result in any change to the screen. The \\'File settings\\' submenu remains open. This action did not bring the agent closer to saving the note because it did not navigate away from the current submenu. The previous assumption that a back arrow was present was incorrect.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button.

This action is expected to close the \\'File settings\\' submenu and return to the previous menu, which contained options like \\'Share\\', \\'Tools\\', \\'Info\\', and \\'Reload\\'. This will allow further exploration for a \\'Save\\' option. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action was successful. It closed the \"File settings\" submenu that was previously open. The screen now shows the main note editor with the text \"Ignorance is bliss.\" The top bar of the editor now displays several icons, including an eye icon, a floppy disk icon (likely a save button), a search icon, and a three-dot menu icon. This action brought the agent closer to saving the note by returning to the editor view where a save icon is now visible.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 42, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.46\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 66, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [73, 34, 100, 419], \\'text\\': \\'2023_01_26_wi_\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 728, 95, 900], \\'text\\': \\'0 Q\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [135, 34, 155, 331], \\'text\\': \\'Ignorance is bliss.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [887, 142, 916, 492], \\'text\\': \\'= B I\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 653], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 620, 100, 700]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 908, 101, 985]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 814, 102, 894]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 822, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 520, 97, 604]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 716, 101, 798]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 481, 944, 580]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 594, 941, 696]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 954, 924, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 126, 927, 228]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 905, 36, 943]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 717, 932, 815]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 250, 926, 340]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 38, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 839, 925, 927]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 359, 935, 462]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 9, 926, 103]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 141, 37, 188]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"0\", text=\"Ignorance is bliss.\", resource-id=\"net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"net.gsantner.markor\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[0,275][1080,2102]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"Ignorance is bliss.\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This will restore the intended content of the note before attempting to save it again. Actual Outcome: The `INPUT_TEXT` action successfully entered \"Ignorance is bliss.\" into the main content area of the note. The screen now displays this text in the editor, and the text field is still focused with the cursor at the end of the entered text. This action has successfully restored the correct content to the note, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of saving the note.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (coordinates approximately [84, 946]). This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a context menu which might contain a \\'Save\\' option for the note. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [84, 946] (top right) was successful. A context menu appeared on the right side of the screen with the options: \\'File settings\\', \\'Share\\', \\'Tools\\', \\'Info\\', and \\'Reload\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal of saving the note by revealing potential options for saving.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,715],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'File settings\\' option in the currently open menu. The \\'File settings\\' option is the first item in the menu. This action is expected to open a submenu or a new screen related to file settings, where a \\'Save\\' option might be present. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'File settings\\' was successful. It opened a new submenu titled \\'File settings\\' which displays options: \\'Wrap words\\', \\'Syntax highlighting\\', \\'Auto-format\\', \\'Font Size\\', and \\'Format\\'. No \\'Save\\' option is visible in this submenu. This action helped explore menu options but did not directly lead to saving the note. The agent is closer to completing the subgoal by systematically checking available options. The next step is to navigate back from this submenu to continue searching for a save mechanism.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,465],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located to the left of the \\'File settings\\' title in the submenu. This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to close the \\'File settings\\' submenu and return to the previous menu (the one with \\'Share\\', \\'Tools\\', \\'Info\\', \\'Reload\\'). Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'File settings\\' at [85, 465] (which corresponds to the title of the already open \\'File settings\\' submenu) did not result in any change to the screen. The \\'File settings\\' submenu remains open. This action did not bring the agent closer to saving the note because it did not navigate away from the current submenu. The previous assumption that a back arrow was present was incorrect.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button. The \\'File settings\\' submenu is currently open. This action is expected to close the \\'File settings\\' submenu and return to the previous menu, which contained options like \\'Share\\', \\'Tools\\', \\'Info\\', and \\'Reload\\'. This will allow further exploration for a \\'Save\\' option. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action was successful. It closed the \"File settings\" submenu that was previously open. The screen now shows the main note editor with the text \"Ignorance is bliss.\" The top bar of the editor now displays several icons, including an eye icon, a floppy disk icon (likely a save button), a search icon, and a three-dot menu icon. This action brought the agent closer to saving the note by returning to the editor view where a save icon is now visible.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 18: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the save icon (floppy disk) located in the top bar at approximately [84, 757]. This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to save the note \\'2023_01_26_wise_yacht.md\\' with the content \\'Ignorance is bliss.\\'. After saving, the app might return to the main screen, close the editor, or display a confirmation message.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",
        "response": "{'ScreenshotDifferenceObservation': \"The primary difference between the two screenshots is the disappearance of the floppy disk icon (save icon) from the top bar after the tap action. In the first screenshot, the save icon is visible at coordinates approximately [84, 757]. In the second screenshot, this icon is no longer present. Additionally, the text in the editor in the second screenshot shows a cursor at the end: 'Ignorance is bliss |', whereas in the first screenshot, it was just 'Ignorance is bliss.'. The rest of the screen elements, such as the note content, other icons in the top bar (eye, search, three-dot menu), and the bottom toolbar, remain largely the same.\", 'StepByStepExplanation': \"The last action was to tap on the save icon (floppy disk). The disappearance of this icon in the second screenshot is a strong indicator that the save operation was successful. The note content 'Ignorance is bliss.' is still visible, and the filename '2023_01_26_wise_yacht.md' was set in a previous step. Therefore, the active subgoal 'Save the New Note' can be considered completed. Since this was the last subgoal in the plan, the overall user instruction is now fulfilled. The next step is to mark the active subgoal as completed and, as all subgoals are completed, set the next subgoal ID to a new, unused ID.\", 'ActionOutcomeDescription': \"The action of tapping on the save icon (floppy disk) at [84, 757] was successful. As a result, the save icon disappeared from the top bar, which strongly indicates that the note '2023_01_26_wise_yacht.md' with the content 'Ignorance is bliss.' has been saved. The editor view remains open with the text 'Ignorance is bliss |' and the cursor at the end.

However, this action converted the current line of text into a to-do list item ('- [ ] Ignorance is bliss.') instead of saving the note. The `DELETE_TEXT` action successfully cleared the incorrect text from the editor. The text 'Ignorance is bliss.' has now been successfully re-entered into the editor. Tapped on the three-dot menu icon at the top right, which opened a menu with options: 'File settings', 'Share', 'Tools', 'Info', 'Reload'. Tapped on 'File settings', which opened a submenu with options 'Wrap words', 'Syntax highlighting', 'Auto-format', 'Font Size', and 'Format'. No 'Save' option was found in this submenu. Attempted to tap a non-existent back arrow in the 'File settings' submenu; this action had no effect. Pressed the system back button (KEYCODE_BACK), which successfully closed the 'File settings' submenu and returned to the editor screen. A save icon (floppy disk) became visible in the top bar.
