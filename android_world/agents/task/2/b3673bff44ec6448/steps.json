Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is intended to open the Files app. The \"Files\" app is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \"Files\" app icon was successful. The \"Files\" app opened and is currently displaying the \"Downloads\" folder, which shows \"No items\". This action successfully completed the first subgoal, \"Open File Manager App\", bringing the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.35\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 175, 91, 425], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [126, 55, 142, 232], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [177, 149, 197, 272], \\'text\\': \\'Images\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 413, 193, 504], \\'text\\': \\'Audio\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 644, 193, 752], \\'text\\': \\'Videos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 894, 193, 1000], \\'text\\': \\'Docum\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [238, 57, 252, 310], \\'text\\': \\'Files in Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [611, 420, 627, 582], \\'text\\': \\'No items\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [425, 345, 528, 655]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 545, 205, 779]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 313, 205, 533]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 795, 205, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [65, 789, 95, 860]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 864, 94, 973]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [12, 820, 40, 948]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [225, 823, 271, 938]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 195, 38, 242]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [124, 54, 143, 234]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [48, 115, 95, 421]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14.

Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.35\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 175, 91, 425], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [126, 55, 142, 232], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [177, 149, 197, 272], \\'text\\': \\'Images\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 413, 193, 504], \\'text\\': \\'Audio\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 644, 193, 752], \\'text\\': \\'Videos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 894, 193, 1000], \\'text\\': \\'Docum\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [238, 57, 252, 310], \\'text\\': \\'Files in Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [611, 420, 627, 582], \\'text\\': \\'No items\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [425, 345, 528, 655]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 545, 205, 779]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 313, 205, 533]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 795, 205, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [65, 788, 95, 860]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 864, 94, 973]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [11, 820, 40, 948]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [225, 823, 271, 938]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 195, 38, 242]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [124, 54, 143, 234]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [49, 115, 95, 421]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is taken because the file manager app is not visible on the home screen, and opening the app drawer is the standard way to access all installed applications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This is a positive step towards opening the file manager app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a menu with options that might include navigating to storage devices or other settings. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon (located around [80, 918]) successfully opened a pop-up menu. The menu contains the following options: \"New window\", \"New folder\", \"Sort by...\", \"Select all\", \"Get info\", and \"Show hidden files\". This action did not bring the agent closer to navigating to the \"Notifications\" folder because the menu options are not related to storage navigation.

If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is taken because the file manager app is not visible on the home screen, and opening the app drawer is the standard way to access all installed applications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This is a positive step towards opening the file manager app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[773,164],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Files\" app icon, which is labeled \"Files\" and located at approximately [773, 164]. This action is intended to open the Files app. The \"Files\" app is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \"Files\" app icon was successful. The \"Files\" app opened and is currently displaying the \"Downloads\" folder, which shows \"No items\". This action successfully completed the first subgoal, \"Open File Manager App\", bringing the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,60],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located in the top-left corner of the screen (estimated at [80, 60]). This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a navigation drawer or menu, which should allow me to select the storage device and navigate to the required folder. Actual Outcome: The tap on the hamburger menu icon at [80, 60] did not result in any change to the screen. The \\'Downloads\\' view with \\'No items\\' remains. The action failed to open a navigation drawer or menu, and therefore did not bring the agent closer to navigating to the target folder.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,918],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at approximately [80, 918] in the top-right corner. This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a menu with options that might include navigating to storage devices or other settings. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon (located around [80, 918]) successfully opened a pop-up menu. The menu contains the following options: \"New window\", \"New folder\", \"Sort by...\", \"Select all\", \"Get info\", and \"Show hidden files\". This action did not bring the agent closer to navigating to the \"Notifications\" folder because the menu options are not related to storage navigation. The next logical step is to press the system \"Back\" button to close the menu and attempt to navigate to a higher-level directory or storage selection screen.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 4: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send keyevent \\'KEYCODE_BACK\\' to close the currently open context menu.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field.

If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

This action is taken because the file manager app is not visible on the home screen, and opening the app drawer is the standard way to access all installed applications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This is a positive step towards opening the file manager app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[773,164],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Files\" app icon, which is labeled \"Files\" and located at approximately [773, 164]. This action is intended to open the Files app. The \"Files\" app is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \"Files\" app icon was successful. The \"Files\" app opened and is currently displaying the \"Downloads\" folder, which shows \"No items\". This action successfully completed the first subgoal, \"Open File Manager App\", bringing the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,60],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located in the top-left corner of the screen (estimated at [80, 60]). This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a navigation drawer or menu, which should allow me to select the storage device and navigate to the required folder. Actual Outcome: The tap on the hamburger menu icon at [80, 60] did not result in any change to the screen. The \\'Downloads\\' view with \\'No items\\' remains. The action failed to open a navigation drawer or menu, and therefore did not bring the agent closer to navigating to the target folder.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,918],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at approximately [80, 918] in the top-right corner. This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a menu with options that might include navigating to storage devices or other settings. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon (located around [80, 918]) successfully opened a pop-up menu. The menu contains the following options: \"New window\", \"New folder\", \"Sort by...\", \"Select all\", \"Get info\", and \"Show hidden files\". This action did not bring the agent closer to navigating to the \"Notifications\" folder because the menu options are not related to storage navigation. The next logical step is to press the system \"Back\" button to close the menu and attempt to navigate to a higher-level directory or storage selection screen.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send keyevent \\'KEYCODE_BACK\\' to close the currently open context menu. This is expected to return the app to the previous screen, which might be the main Downloads view without the menu, or potentially a higher-level directory view where storage devices can be selected. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the context menu that was opened by tapping the three-dots icon. The screen returned to the \"Downloads\" view, showing categories like \"Images\", \"Audio\", \"Videos\", and \"Documents\", with \"No items\" displayed. This action brought the agent back to a state where navigation can be attempted again, but it did not directly bring it closer to the \"Notifications\" folder. The next step is to find a way to navigate to the storage device.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.37\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 175, 91, 425], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [126, 55, 142, 232], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [177, 149, 197, 272], \\'text\\': \\'Images\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 413, 193, 504], \\'text\\': \\'Audio\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 644, 193, 752], \\'text\\': \\'Videos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 894, 193, 1000], \\'text\\': \\'Docum\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [238, 57, 252, 310], \\'text\\': \\'Files in Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [611, 420, 627, 582], \\'text\\': \\'No items\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [425, 345, 528, 655]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 545, 205, 779]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 313, 205, 533]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 795, 205, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [65, 789, 94, 859]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 860, 93, 971]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [225, 823, 271, 938]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 195, 38, 241]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [12, 820, 39, 949]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [124, 54, 143, 234]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [49, 116, 95, 421]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 38, 38, 193]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

This action is taken because the file manager app is not visible on the home screen, and opening the app drawer is the standard way to access all installed applications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This is a positive step towards opening the file manager app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[773,164],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Files\" app icon, which is labeled \"Files\" and located at approximately [773, 164]. This action is intended to open the Files app. The \"Files\" app is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \"Files\" app icon was successful. The \"Files\" app opened and is currently displaying the \"Downloads\" folder, which shows \"No items\". This action successfully completed the first subgoal, \"Open File Manager App\", bringing the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,60],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located in the top-left corner of the screen (estimated at [80, 60]). This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a navigation drawer or menu, which should allow me to select the storage device and navigate to the required folder. Actual Outcome: The tap on the hamburger menu icon at [80, 60] did not result in any change to the screen. The \\'Downloads\\' view with \\'No items\\' remains. The action failed to open a navigation drawer or menu, and therefore did not bring the agent closer to navigating to the target folder.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,918],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at approximately [80, 918] in the top-right corner. This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a menu with options that might include navigating to storage devices or other settings. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon (located around [80, 918]) successfully opened a pop-up menu. The menu contains the following options: \"New window\", \"New folder\", \"Sort by...\", \"Select all\", \"Get info\", and \"Show hidden files\". This action did not bring the agent closer to navigating to the \"Notifications\" folder because the menu options are not related to storage navigation. The next logical step is to press the system \"Back\" button to close the menu and attempt to navigate to a higher-level directory or storage selection screen.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send keyevent \\'KEYCODE_BACK\\' to close the currently open context menu. This is expected to return the app to the previous screen, which might be the main Downloads view without the menu, or potentially a higher-level directory view where storage devices can be selected. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the context menu that was opened by tapping the three-dots icon. The screen returned to the \"Downloads\" view, showing categories like \"Images\", \"Audio\", \"Videos\", and \"Documents\", with \"No items\" displayed. This action brought the agent back to a state where navigation can be attempted again, but it did not directly bring it closer to the \"Notifications\" folder. The next step is to find a way to navigate to the storage device.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 5: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Downloads\" title text located at approximately [80, 300]. This text is currently visible. This action is an attempt to navigate to a higher-level directory or a view that allows selection of storage devices, as it might function as a breadcrumb. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open File Manager App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"A file manager app (e.g., \\\\\"Files\\\\\") is open and displaying its main interface.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Swiped up from the home screen to open the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

However, the \"Downloads\" title is located at [69, 175]. The point [80, 300] is below the title and above the filter buttons (\"Images\", \"Audio\", etc.).

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[773,164],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Files\" app icon, which is labeled \"Files\" and located at approximately [773, 164]. This action is intended to open the Files app. The \"Files\" app is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \"Files\" app icon was successful. The \"Files\" app opened and is currently displaying the \"Downloads\" folder, which shows \"No items\". This action successfully completed the first subgoal, \"Open File Manager App\", bringing the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,60],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located in the top-left corner of the screen (estimated at [80, 60]). This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a navigation drawer or menu, which should allow me to select the storage device and navigate to the required folder. Actual Outcome: The tap on the hamburger menu icon at [80, 60] did not result in any change to the screen. The \\'Downloads\\' view with \\'No items\\' remains. The action failed to open a navigation drawer or menu, and therefore did not bring the agent closer to navigating to the target folder.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,918],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at approximately [80, 918] in the top-right corner. This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a menu with options that might include navigating to storage devices or other settings. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon (located around [80, 918]) successfully opened a pop-up menu. The menu contains the following options: \"New window\", \"New folder\", \"Sort by...\", \"Select all\", \"Get info\", and \"Show hidden files\". This action did not bring the agent closer to navigating to the \"Notifications\" folder because the menu options are not related to storage navigation. The next logical step is to press the system \"Back\" button to close the menu and attempt to navigate to a higher-level directory or storage selection screen.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send keyevent \\'KEYCODE_BACK\\' to close the currently open context menu. This is expected to return the app to the previous screen, which might be the main Downloads view without the menu, or potentially a higher-level directory view where storage devices can be selected. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the context menu that was opened by tapping the three-dots icon. The screen returned to the \"Downloads\" view, showing categories like \"Images\", \"Audio\", \"Videos\", and \"Documents\", with \"No items\" displayed. This action brought the agent back to a state where navigation can be attempted again, but it did not directly bring it closer to the \"Notifications\" folder. The next step is to find a way to navigate to the storage device.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Downloads\" title text located at approximately [80, 300]. This text is currently visible. This action is an attempt to navigate to a higher-level directory or a view that allows selection of storage devices, as it might function as a breadcrumb. Actual Outcome: The action was a tap at [80, 300]. The intention was to tap the \"Downloads\" title, but the coordinates were incorrect. The \"Downloads\" title is at [69, 175]. The tap at [80, 300] landed on an area that did not trigger any navigation or change in the UI. The screen remains unchanged, displaying the \"Downloads\" folder with \"No items\". The action was a failure as it did not bring the agent closer to navigating to the \"Notifications\" folder.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.37\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 175, 91, 425], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [126, 55, 142, 232], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [177, 149, 197, 272], \\'text\\': \\'Images\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 413, 193, 504], \\'text\\': \\'Audio\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 644, 193, 752], \\'text\\': \\'Videos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 894, 193, 1000], \\'text\\': \\'Docum\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [238, 57, 252, 310], \\'text\\': \\'Files in Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [611, 420, 627, 582], \\'text\\': \\'No items\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [425, 345, 528, 655]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 545, 205, 779]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 313, 205, 533]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 795, 205, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [65, 788, 95, 861]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 865, 94, 973]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [11, 820, 40, 948]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [225, 823, 271, 938]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 195, 38, 242]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [48, 115, 95, 421]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [124, 54, 143, 234]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 28, 38, 192]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[773,164],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Files\" app icon, which is labeled \"Files\" and located at approximately [773, 164]. This action is intended to open the Files app. The \"Files\" app is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \"Files\" app icon was successful. The \"Files\" app opened and is currently displaying the \"Downloads\" folder, which shows \"No items\". This action successfully completed the first subgoal, \"Open File Manager App\", bringing the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,60],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located in the top-left corner of the screen (estimated at [80, 60]). This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a navigation drawer or menu, which should allow me to select the storage device and navigate to the required folder. Actual Outcome: The tap on the hamburger menu icon at [80, 60] did not result in any change to the screen. The \\'Downloads\\' view with \\'No items\\' remains. The action failed to open a navigation drawer or menu, and therefore did not bring the agent closer to navigating to the target folder.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,918],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at approximately [80, 918] in the top-right corner. This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a menu with options that might include navigating to storage devices or other settings. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon (located around [80, 918]) successfully opened a pop-up menu. The menu contains the following options: \"New window\", \"New folder\", \"Sort by...\", \"Select all\", \"Get info\", and \"Show hidden files\". This action did not bring the agent closer to navigating to the \"Notifications\" folder because the menu options are not related to storage navigation. The next logical step is to press the system \"Back\" button to close the menu and attempt to navigate to a higher-level directory or storage selection screen.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send keyevent \\'KEYCODE_BACK\\' to close the currently open context menu. This is expected to return the app to the previous screen, which might be the main Downloads view without the menu, or potentially a higher-level directory view where storage devices can be selected. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the context menu that was opened by tapping the three-dots icon. The screen returned to the \"Downloads\" view, showing categories like \"Images\", \"Audio\", \"Videos\", and \"Documents\", with \"No items\" displayed. This action brought the agent back to a state where navigation can be attempted again, but it did not directly bring it closer to the \"Notifications\" folder. The next step is to find a way to navigate to the storage device.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Downloads\" title text located at approximately [80, 300]. This text is currently visible. This action is an attempt to navigate to a higher-level directory or a view that allows selection of storage devices, as it might function as a breadcrumb. Actual Outcome: The action was a tap at [80, 300]. The intention was to tap the \"Downloads\" title, but the coordinates were incorrect. The \"Downloads\" title is at [69, 175]. The tap at [80, 300] landed on an area that did not trigger any navigation or change in the UI. The screen remains unchanged, displaying the \"Downloads\" folder with \"No items\". The action was a failure as it did not bring the agent closer to navigating to the \"Notifications\" folder.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 6: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,80],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon, estimated to be around [80, 80], to the left of the \\'Downloads\\' title. This icon is currently visible. This action is intended to open a navigation drawer or menu, which should allow navigation to different storage locations and folders. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open File Manager App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"A file manager app (e.g., \\\\\"Files\\\\\") is open and displaying its main interface.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Swiped up from the home screen to open the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,60],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located in the top-left corner of the screen (estimated at [80, 60]). This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a navigation drawer or menu, which should allow me to select the storage device and navigate to the required folder. Actual Outcome: The tap on the hamburger menu icon at [80, 60] did not result in any change to the screen. The \\'Downloads\\' view with \\'No items\\' remains. The action failed to open a navigation drawer or menu, and therefore did not bring the agent closer to navigating to the target folder.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,918],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at approximately [80, 918] in the top-right corner. This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a menu with options that might include navigating to storage devices or other settings. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon (located around [80, 918]) successfully opened a pop-up menu. The menu contains the following options: \"New window\", \"New folder\", \"Sort by...\", \"Select all\", \"Get info\", and \"Show hidden files\". This action did not bring the agent closer to navigating to the \"Notifications\" folder because the menu options are not related to storage navigation. The next logical step is to press the system \"Back\" button to close the menu and attempt to navigate to a higher-level directory or storage selection screen.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send keyevent \\'KEYCODE_BACK\\' to close the currently open context menu. This is expected to return the app to the previous screen, which might be the main Downloads view without the menu, or potentially a higher-level directory view where storage devices can be selected. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the context menu that was opened by tapping the three-dots icon. The screen returned to the \"Downloads\" view, showing categories like \"Images\", \"Audio\", \"Videos\", and \"Documents\", with \"No items\" displayed. This action brought the agent back to a state where navigation can be attempted again, but it did not directly bring it closer to the \"Notifications\" folder. The next step is to find a way to navigate to the storage device.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Downloads\" title text located at approximately [80, 300]. This text is currently visible. This action is an attempt to navigate to a higher-level directory or a view that allows selection of storage devices, as it might function as a breadcrumb. Actual Outcome: The action was a tap at [80, 300]. The intention was to tap the \"Downloads\" title, but the coordinates were incorrect. The \"Downloads\" title is at [69, 175]. The tap at [80, 300] landed on an area that did not trigger any navigation or change in the UI. The screen remains unchanged, displaying the \"Downloads\" folder with \"No items\". The action was a failure as it did not bring the agent closer to navigating to the \"Notifications\" folder.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,80],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon, estimated to be around [80, 80], to the left of the \\'Downloads\\' title. This icon is currently visible. This action is intended to open a navigation drawer or menu, which should allow navigation to different storage locations and folders. Actual Outcome: The tap on the hamburger menu icon at [80, 80] successfully opened the navigation drawer. The drawer is now visible on the left side of the screen, showing various file categories and storage locations, including \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\". This action has brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to the target folder.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 43, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.38\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 93, 220], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1 dX: 0.0 Files\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [137, 152, 155, 267], \\'text\\': \\'Recent\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 677, 193, 752], \\'text\\': \\'Heos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 894, 193, 1000], \\'text\\': \\'Docum\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [200, 151, 217, 273], \\'text\\': \\'Images\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [260, 153, 277, 265], \\'text\\': \\'Videos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [322, 155, 337, 249], \\'text\\': \\'Audio\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [384, 154, 399, 333], \\'text\\': \\'Documents\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [444, 153, 461, 330], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [533, 150, 552, 512], \\'text\\': \\'sdk_gphone64_x86_64\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [598, 151, 615, 291], \\'text\\': \\'SDCARD\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [364, 12, 420, 671]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [429, 10, 476, 670]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [302, 16, 361, 665]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 795, 205, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [242, 15, 301, 660]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [580, 22, 634, 539]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 192, 38, 244]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [65, 785, 103, 863]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [587, 551, 628, 646]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 138, 38, 188]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [13, 815, 39, 955]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,60],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located in the top-left corner of the screen (estimated at [80, 60]). This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a navigation drawer or menu, which should allow me to select the storage device and navigate to the required folder. Actual Outcome: The tap on the hamburger menu icon at [80, 60] did not result in any change to the screen. The \\'Downloads\\' view with \\'No items\\' remains. The action failed to open a navigation drawer or menu, and therefore did not bring the agent closer to navigating to the target folder.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,918],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at approximately [80, 918] in the top-right corner. This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a menu with options that might include navigating to storage devices or other settings. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon (located around [80, 918]) successfully opened a pop-up menu. The menu contains the following options: \"New window\", \"New folder\", \"Sort by...\", \"Select all\", \"Get info\", and \"Show hidden files\". This action did not bring the agent closer to navigating to the \"Notifications\" folder because the menu options are not related to storage navigation. The next logical step is to press the system \"Back\" button to close the menu and attempt to navigate to a higher-level directory or storage selection screen.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send keyevent \\'KEYCODE_BACK\\' to close the currently open context menu. This is expected to return the app to the previous screen, which might be the main Downloads view without the menu, or potentially a higher-level directory view where storage devices can be selected. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the context menu that was opened by tapping the three-dots icon. The screen returned to the \"Downloads\" view, showing categories like \"Images\", \"Audio\", \"Videos\", and \"Documents\", with \"No items\" displayed. This action brought the agent back to a state where navigation can be attempted again, but it did not directly bring it closer to the \"Notifications\" folder. The next step is to find a way to navigate to the storage device.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Downloads\" title text located at approximately [80, 300]. This text is currently visible. This action is an attempt to navigate to a higher-level directory or a view that allows selection of storage devices, as it might function as a breadcrumb. Actual Outcome: The action was a tap at [80, 300]. The intention was to tap the \"Downloads\" title, but the coordinates were incorrect. The \"Downloads\" title is at [69, 175]. The tap at [80, 300] landed on an area that did not trigger any navigation or change in the UI. The screen remains unchanged, displaying the \"Downloads\" folder with \"No items\". The action was a failure as it did not bring the agent closer to navigating to the \"Notifications\" folder.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,80],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon, estimated to be around [80, 80], to the left of the \\'Downloads\\' title. This icon is currently visible. This action is intended to open a navigation drawer or menu, which should allow navigation to different storage locations and folders. Actual Outcome: The tap on the hamburger menu icon at [80, 80] successfully opened the navigation drawer. The drawer is now visible on the left side of the screen, showing various file categories and storage locations, including \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\". This action has brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to the target folder.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 7: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[542,331],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\" entry in the navigation drawer. The text \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\" is visible with bounding box [533, 150, 552, 512]. This action is expected to open the root directory of the \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\" storage, allowing further navigation to the \"Notifications\" folder. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open File Manager App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"A file manager app (e.g., \\\\\"Files\\\\\") is open and displaying its main interface.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Swiped up from the home screen to open the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,918],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at approximately [80, 918] in the top-right corner. This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a menu with options that might include navigating to storage devices or other settings. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon (located around [80, 918]) successfully opened a pop-up menu. The menu contains the following options: \"New window\", \"New folder\", \"Sort by...\", \"Select all\", \"Get info\", and \"Show hidden files\". This action did not bring the agent closer to navigating to the \"Notifications\" folder because the menu options are not related to storage navigation. The next logical step is to press the system \"Back\" button to close the menu and attempt to navigate to a higher-level directory or storage selection screen.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send keyevent \\'KEYCODE_BACK\\' to close the currently open context menu. This is expected to return the app to the previous screen, which might be the main Downloads view without the menu, or potentially a higher-level directory view where storage devices can be selected. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the context menu that was opened by tapping the three-dots icon. The screen returned to the \"Downloads\" view, showing categories like \"Images\", \"Audio\", \"Videos\", and \"Documents\", with \"No items\" displayed. This action brought the agent back to a state where navigation can be attempted again, but it did not directly bring it closer to the \"Notifications\" folder. The next step is to find a way to navigate to the storage device.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Downloads\" title text located at approximately [80, 300]. This text is currently visible. This action is an attempt to navigate to a higher-level directory or a view that allows selection of storage devices, as it might function as a breadcrumb. Actual Outcome: The action was a tap at [80, 300]. The intention was to tap the \"Downloads\" title, but the coordinates were incorrect. The \"Downloads\" title is at [69, 175]. The tap at [80, 300] landed on an area that did not trigger any navigation or change in the UI. The screen remains unchanged, displaying the \"Downloads\" folder with \"No items\". The action was a failure as it did not bring the agent closer to navigating to the \"Notifications\" folder.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,80],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon, estimated to be around [80, 80], to the left of the \\'Downloads\\' title. This icon is currently visible. This action is intended to open a navigation drawer or menu, which should allow navigation to different storage locations and folders. Actual Outcome: The tap on the hamburger menu icon at [80, 80] successfully opened the navigation drawer. The drawer is now visible on the left side of the screen, showing various file categories and storage locations, including \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\". This action has brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to the target folder.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[542,331],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\" entry in the navigation drawer. The text \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\" is visible with bounding box [533, 150, 552, 512]. This action is expected to open the root directory of the \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\" storage, allowing further navigation to the \"Notifications\" folder. Actual Outcome: The tap on \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\" (at [542, 331], which corresponds to the text \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\" with bounding box [533, 150, 552, 512]) successfully navigated into the selected storage area. The screen now displays the root directory of \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\", showing various folders. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the \"Notifications\" folder is now accessible.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,918],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at approximately [80, 918] in the top-right corner. This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a menu with options that might include navigating to storage devices or other settings. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon (located around [80, 918]) successfully opened a pop-up menu. The menu contains the following options: \"New window\", \"New folder\", \"Sort by...\", \"Select all\", \"Get info\", and \"Show hidden files\". This action did not bring the agent closer to navigating to the \"Notifications\" folder because the menu options are not related to storage navigation. The next logical step is to press the system \"Back\" button to close the menu and attempt to navigate to a higher-level directory or storage selection screen.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send keyevent \\'KEYCODE_BACK\\' to close the currently open context menu. This is expected to return the app to the previous screen, which might be the main Downloads view without the menu, or potentially a higher-level directory view where storage devices can be selected. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the context menu that was opened by tapping the three-dots icon. The screen returned to the \"Downloads\" view, showing categories like \"Images\", \"Audio\", \"Videos\", and \"Documents\", with \"No items\" displayed. This action brought the agent back to a state where navigation can be attempted again, but it did not directly bring it closer to the \"Notifications\" folder. The next step is to find a way to navigate to the storage device.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Downloads\" title text located at approximately [80, 300]. This text is currently visible. This action is an attempt to navigate to a higher-level directory or a view that allows selection of storage devices, as it might function as a breadcrumb. Actual Outcome: The action was a tap at [80, 300]. The intention was to tap the \"Downloads\" title, but the coordinates were incorrect. The \"Downloads\" title is at [69, 175]. The tap at [80, 300] landed on an area that did not trigger any navigation or change in the UI. The screen remains unchanged, displaying the \"Downloads\" folder with \"No items\". The action was a failure as it did not bring the agent closer to navigating to the \"Notifications\" folder.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,80],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon, estimated to be around [80, 80], to the left of the \\'Downloads\\' title. This icon is currently visible. This action is intended to open a navigation drawer or menu, which should allow navigation to different storage locations and folders. Actual Outcome: The tap on the hamburger menu icon at [80, 80] successfully opened the navigation drawer. The drawer is now visible on the left side of the screen, showing various file categories and storage locations, including \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\". This action has brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to the target folder.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[542,331],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\" entry in the navigation drawer. The text \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\" is visible with bounding box [533, 150, 552, 512]. This action is expected to open the root directory of the \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\" storage, allowing further navigation to the \"Notifications\" folder. Actual Outcome: The tap on \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\" (at [542, 331], which corresponds to the text \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\" with bounding box [533, 150, 552, 512]) successfully navigated into the selected storage area. The screen now displays the root directory of \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\", showing various folders. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the \"Notifications\" folder is now accessible.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 8: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[558,271],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Notifications\" folder, which is visible on the screen with text \"Notifications\" and bounding box [550, 171, 565, 370]. This action is expected to open the \"Notifications\" folder and display its contents. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open File Manager App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"A file manager app (e.g., \\\\\"Files\\\\\") is open and displaying its main interface.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Swiped up from the home screen to open the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is expected to return the app to the previous screen, which might be the main Downloads view without the menu, or potentially a higher-level directory view where storage devices can be selected. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the context menu that was opened by tapping the three-dots icon. The screen returned to the \"Downloads\" view, showing categories like \"Images\", \"Audio\", \"Videos\", and \"Documents\", with \"No items\" displayed. This action brought the agent back to a state where navigation can be attempted again, but it did not directly bring it closer to the \"Notifications\" folder. The next step is to find a way to navigate to the storage device.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Downloads\" title text located at approximately [80, 300]. This text is currently visible. This action is an attempt to navigate to a higher-level directory or a view that allows selection of storage devices, as it might function as a breadcrumb. Actual Outcome: The action was a tap at [80, 300]. The intention was to tap the \"Downloads\" title, but the coordinates were incorrect. The \"Downloads\" title is at [69, 175]. The tap at [80, 300] landed on an area that did not trigger any navigation or change in the UI. The screen remains unchanged, displaying the \"Downloads\" folder with \"No items\". The action was a failure as it did not bring the agent closer to navigating to the \"Notifications\" folder.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,80],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon, estimated to be around [80, 80], to the left of the \\'Downloads\\' title. This icon is currently visible. This action is intended to open a navigation drawer or menu, which should allow navigation to different storage locations and folders. Actual Outcome: The tap on the hamburger menu icon at [80, 80] successfully opened the navigation drawer. The drawer is now visible on the left side of the screen, showing various file categories and storage locations, including \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\". This action has brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to the target folder.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[542,331],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\" entry in the navigation drawer. The text \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\" is visible with bounding box [533, 150, 552, 512]. This action is expected to open the root directory of the \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\" storage, allowing further navigation to the \"Notifications\" folder. Actual Outcome: The tap on \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\" (at [542, 331], which corresponds to the text \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\" with bounding box [533, 150, 552, 512]) successfully navigated into the selected storage area. The screen now displays the root directory of \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\", showing various folders. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the \"Notifications\" folder is now accessible.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[558,271],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Notifications\" folder, which is visible on the screen with text \"Notifications\" and bounding box [550, 171, 565, 370]. This action is expected to open the \"Notifications\" folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The action was a tap on the \"Notifications\" folder, located at approximately [558, 271] (corresponding to the text \"Notifications\" with bounding box [550, 171, 565, 370]). This action successfully opened the \"Notifications\" folder. The screen now displays the files within the \"Notifications\" folder. This action brought the agent closer to completing the overall user instruction by successfully navigating to the target folder, thus completing Subgoal 2. The next step is to locate and attempt to delete the specified file within this folder.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.39\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 92, 503], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0 dY: 0.0 Xv: 0.0 Notifications\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [124, 51, 145, 416], \\'text\\': \\'sdk_gphone64_x86_64\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [125, 504, 142, 705], \\'text\\': \\'Notifications\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [177, 150, 197, 272], \\'text\\': \\'Images\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 413, 193, 504], \\'text\\': \\'Audio\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 644, 193, 752], \\'text\\': \\'Videos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 894, 193, 1000], \\'text\\': \\'Docum\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [238, 57, 252, 334], \\'text\\': \\'Files in Notifications\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [489, 179, 523, 437], \\'text\\': \\'2023_02_14_we. 21 B 15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [488, 629, 523, 900], \\'text\\': \\'2023_08_21_cal. 21 B 15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [748, 177, 765, 439], \\'text\\': \\'2023_08_23_em.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [746, 627, 782, 875], \\'text\\': \\'app_alert_2023_ 21 B 15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [770, 180, 782, 327], \\'text\\': \\'21 B 15.34\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 546, 205, 779]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 313, 205, 533]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 794, 205, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [544, 59, 795, 496]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 795, 93, 854]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 856, 93, 971]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [231, 837, 259, 932]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [544, 513, 796, 944]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [282, 512, 538, 946]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [123, 501, 144, 711]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [12, 822, 39, 946]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [284, 58, 538, 497]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 196, 37, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [803, 57, 1000, 488]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is expected to return the app to the previous screen, which might be the main Downloads view without the menu, or potentially a higher-level directory view where storage devices can be selected. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the context menu that was opened by tapping the three-dots icon. The screen returned to the \"Downloads\" view, showing categories like \"Images\", \"Audio\", \"Videos\", and \"Documents\", with \"No items\" displayed. This action brought the agent back to a state where navigation can be attempted again, but it did not directly bring it closer to the \"Notifications\" folder. The next step is to find a way to navigate to the storage device.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Downloads\" title text located at approximately [80, 300]. This text is currently visible. This action is an attempt to navigate to a higher-level directory or a view that allows selection of storage devices, as it might function as a breadcrumb. Actual Outcome: The action was a tap at [80, 300]. The intention was to tap the \"Downloads\" title, but the coordinates were incorrect. The \"Downloads\" title is at [69, 175]. The tap at [80, 300] landed on an area that did not trigger any navigation or change in the UI. The screen remains unchanged, displaying the \"Downloads\" folder with \"No items\". The action was a failure as it did not bring the agent closer to navigating to the \"Notifications\" folder.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,80],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon, estimated to be around [80, 80], to the left of the \\'Downloads\\' title. This icon is currently visible. This action is intended to open a navigation drawer or menu, which should allow navigation to different storage locations and folders. Actual Outcome: The tap on the hamburger menu icon at [80, 80] successfully opened the navigation drawer. The drawer is now visible on the left side of the screen, showing various file categories and storage locations, including \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\". This action has brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to the target folder.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[542,331],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\" entry in the navigation drawer. The text \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\" is visible with bounding box [533, 150, 552, 512]. This action is expected to open the root directory of the \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\" storage, allowing further navigation to the \"Notifications\" folder. Actual Outcome: The tap on \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\" (at [542, 331], which corresponds to the text \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\" with bounding box [533, 150, 552, 512]) successfully navigated into the selected storage area. The screen now displays the root directory of \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\", showing various folders. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the \"Notifications\" folder is now accessible.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[558,271],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Notifications\" folder, which is visible on the screen with text \"Notifications\" and bounding box [550, 171, 565, 370]. This action is expected to open the \"Notifications\" folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The action was a tap on the \"Notifications\" folder, located at approximately [558, 271] (corresponding to the text \"Notifications\" with bounding box [550, 171, 565, 370]). This action successfully opened the \"Notifications\" folder. The screen now displays the files within the \"Notifications\" folder. This action brought the agent closer to completing the overall user instruction by successfully navigating to the target folder, thus completing Subgoal 2. The next step is to locate and attempt to delete the specified file within this folder.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 9: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down the list of files in the \"Notifications\" folder. This is done to check if the target file \"q2a8_fancy_banana.mp3\" is located further down the list, as it is not currently visible. The current screen shows a list of files, and it\\'s possible more files are present below the visible area. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open File Manager App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"A file manager app (e.g., \\\\\"Files\\\\\") is open and displaying its main interface.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Swiped up from the home screen to open the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Downloads\" title text located at approximately [80, 300]. This text is currently visible. This action is an attempt to navigate to a higher-level directory or a view that allows selection of storage devices, as it might function as a breadcrumb. Actual Outcome: The action was a tap at [80, 300]. The intention was to tap the \"Downloads\" title, but the coordinates were incorrect. The \"Downloads\" title is at [69, 175]. The tap at [80, 300] landed on an area that did not trigger any navigation or change in the UI. The screen remains unchanged, displaying the \"Downloads\" folder with \"No items\". The action was a failure as it did not bring the agent closer to navigating to the \"Notifications\" folder.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,80],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon, estimated to be around [80, 80], to the left of the \\'Downloads\\' title. This icon is currently visible. This action is intended to open a navigation drawer or menu, which should allow navigation to different storage locations and folders. Actual Outcome: The tap on the hamburger menu icon at [80, 80] successfully opened the navigation drawer. The drawer is now visible on the left side of the screen, showing various file categories and storage locations, including \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\". This action has brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to the target folder.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[542,331],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\" entry in the navigation drawer. The text \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\" is visible with bounding box [533, 150, 552, 512]. This action is expected to open the root directory of the \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\" storage, allowing further navigation to the \"Notifications\" folder. Actual Outcome: The tap on \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\" (at [542, 331], which corresponds to the text \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\" with bounding box [533, 150, 552, 512]) successfully navigated into the selected storage area. The screen now displays the root directory of \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\", showing various folders. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the \"Notifications\" folder is now accessible.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[558,271],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Notifications\" folder, which is visible on the screen with text \"Notifications\" and bounding box [550, 171, 565, 370]. This action is expected to open the \"Notifications\" folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The action was a tap on the \"Notifications\" folder, located at approximately [558, 271] (corresponding to the text \"Notifications\" with bounding box [550, 171, 565, 370]). This action successfully opened the \"Notifications\" folder. The screen now displays the files within the \"Notifications\" folder. This action brought the agent closer to completing the overall user instruction by successfully navigating to the target folder, thus completing Subgoal 2. The next step is to locate and attempt to delete the specified file within this folder.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down the list of files in the \"Notifications\" folder. This is done to check if the target file \"q2a8_fancy_banana.mp3\" is located further down the list, as it is not currently visible. The current screen shows a list of files, and it\\'s possible more files are present below the visible area. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the content of the \"Notifications\" folder downwards, revealing more files. The file \"edited_q2a8_fan...\", which is presumed to be the target file \"q2a8_fancy_banana.mp3\", is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the target file visible and accessible for interaction.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.40\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [54, 141, 93, 503], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0 IdY:-960.0 Xv: 0.0 Notifications\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 66, 681], \\'text\\': \\'Yv:-0.960\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [330, 177, 365, 438], \\'text\\': \\'2023_08_23_em. 21 B 15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [327, 625, 365, 876], \\'text\\': \\'app_alert_2023 21 B 15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [588, 175, 624, 462], \\'text\\': \\'backup_system __ 21 B 15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [589, 629, 624, 907], \\'text\\': \\'CHTU_sports_sc_ 21 B 15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [849, 176, 884, 453], \\'text\\': \\'edited_q2a8_fan. 21 B 15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [848, 627, 884, 893], \\'text\\': \\'edited_traffic_inf. 21 B 15.34\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [124, 512, 378, 941]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [384, 59, 639, 489]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [645, 61, 897, 490]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [645, 512, 897, 942]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [904, 55, 999, 495]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [65, 787, 96, 863]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [904, 508, 1000, 946]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 899, 94, 971]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [13, 818, 39, 950]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 38, 241]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Downloads\" title text located at approximately [80, 300]. This text is currently visible. This action is an attempt to navigate to a higher-level directory or a view that allows selection of storage devices, as it might function as a breadcrumb. Actual Outcome: The action was a tap at [80, 300]. The intention was to tap the \"Downloads\" title, but the coordinates were incorrect. The \"Downloads\" title is at [69, 175]. The tap at [80, 300] landed on an area that did not trigger any navigation or change in the UI. The screen remains unchanged, displaying the \"Downloads\" folder with \"No items\". The action was a failure as it did not bring the agent closer to navigating to the \"Notifications\" folder.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,80],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon, estimated to be around [80, 80], to the left of the \\'Downloads\\' title. This icon is currently visible. This action is intended to open a navigation drawer or menu, which should allow navigation to different storage locations and folders. Actual Outcome: The tap on the hamburger menu icon at [80, 80] successfully opened the navigation drawer. The drawer is now visible on the left side of the screen, showing various file categories and storage locations, including \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\". This action has brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to the target folder.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[542,331],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\" entry in the navigation drawer. The text \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\" is visible with bounding box [533, 150, 552, 512]. This action is expected to open the root directory of the \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\" storage, allowing further navigation to the \"Notifications\" folder. Actual Outcome: The tap on \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\" (at [542, 331], which corresponds to the text \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\" with bounding box [533, 150, 552, 512]) successfully navigated into the selected storage area. The screen now displays the root directory of \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\", showing various folders. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the \"Notifications\" folder is now accessible.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[558,271],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Notifications\" folder, which is visible on the screen with text \"Notifications\" and bounding box [550, 171, 565, 370]. This action is expected to open the \"Notifications\" folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The action was a tap on the \"Notifications\" folder, located at approximately [558, 271] (corresponding to the text \"Notifications\" with bounding box [550, 171, 565, 370]). This action successfully opened the \"Notifications\" folder. The screen now displays the files within the \"Notifications\" folder. This action brought the agent closer to completing the overall user instruction by successfully navigating to the target folder, thus completing Subgoal 2. The next step is to locate and attempt to delete the specified file within this folder.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down the list of files in the \"Notifications\" folder. This is done to check if the target file \"q2a8_fancy_banana.mp3\" is located further down the list, as it is not currently visible. The current screen shows a list of files, and it\\'s possible more files are present below the visible area. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the content of the \"Notifications\" folder downwards, revealing more files. The file \"edited_q2a8_fan...\", which is presumed to be the target file \"q2a8_fancy_banana.mp3\", is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the target file visible and accessible for interaction.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 10: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[866,314],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file \"edited_q2a8_fan...\" located at approximately [866, 314]. This file is currently visible with bounding box [849, 176, 884, 453]. This action is intended to select the file, which should then allow for deletion. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open File Manager App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"A file manager app (e.g., \\\\\"Files\\\\\") is open and displaying its main interface.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Swiped up from the home screen to open the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,80],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon, estimated to be around [80, 80], to the left of the \\'Downloads\\' title. This icon is currently visible. This action is intended to open a navigation drawer or menu, which should allow navigation to different storage locations and folders. Actual Outcome: The tap on the hamburger menu icon at [80, 80] successfully opened the navigation drawer. The drawer is now visible on the left side of the screen, showing various file categories and storage locations, including \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\". This action has brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to the target folder.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[542,331],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\" entry in the navigation drawer. The text \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\" is visible with bounding box [533, 150, 552, 512]. This action is expected to open the root directory of the \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\" storage, allowing further navigation to the \"Notifications\" folder. Actual Outcome: The tap on \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\" (at [542, 331], which corresponds to the text \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\" with bounding box [533, 150, 552, 512]) successfully navigated into the selected storage area. The screen now displays the root directory of \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\", showing various folders. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the \"Notifications\" folder is now accessible.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[558,271],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Notifications\" folder, which is visible on the screen with text \"Notifications\" and bounding box [550, 171, 565, 370]. This action is expected to open the \"Notifications\" folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The action was a tap on the \"Notifications\" folder, located at approximately [558, 271] (corresponding to the text \"Notifications\" with bounding box [550, 171, 565, 370]). This action successfully opened the \"Notifications\" folder. The screen now displays the files within the \"Notifications\" folder. This action brought the agent closer to completing the overall user instruction by successfully navigating to the target folder, thus completing Subgoal 2. The next step is to locate and attempt to delete the specified file within this folder.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down the list of files in the \"Notifications\" folder. This is done to check if the target file \"q2a8_fancy_banana.mp3\" is located further down the list, as it is not currently visible. The current screen shows a list of files, and it\\'s possible more files are present below the visible area. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the content of the \"Notifications\" folder downwards, revealing more files. The file \"edited_q2a8_fan...\", which is presumed to be the target file \"q2a8_fancy_banana.mp3\", is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the target file visible and accessible for interaction.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[866,314],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file \"edited_q2a8_fan...\" located at approximately [866, 314]. This file is currently visible with bounding box [849, 176, 884, 453]. This action is intended to select the file, which should then allow for deletion. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the file \"edited_q2a8_fan...\" was successful. The file is now selected, which is indicated by a blue highlight, a checkmark, and the text \"1 selected\" at the top of the screen. New icons, including a delete (trash can) icon and a share icon, have appeared at the top right. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the file is now ready to be deleted.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 131], \\'text\\': \\'15.41\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 177, 91, 381], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0 1 selected\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 710, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'IPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [330, 177, 365, 438], \\'text\\': \\'2023_08_23_em. 21 B 15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [327, 625, 365, 876], \\'text\\': \\'app_alert_2023 21 B 15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [588, 175, 624, 457], \\'text\\': \\'backup_system __ 21 B 15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [589, 629, 624, 907], \\'text\\': \\'CHTU_sports_sc_ 21 B 15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [847, 175, 884, 451], \\'text\\': \\'edited_q2a8_fan  21 B 15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [848, 627, 884, 893], \\'text\\': \\'edited_traffic_inf. 21 B 15.34\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [124, 511, 378, 941]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [644, 58, 898, 492]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [385, 59, 638, 490]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [904, 56, 999, 495]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [645, 514, 897, 942]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [904, 508, 999, 945]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 787, 94, 855]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [50, 678, 95, 753]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 36, 242]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [65, 881, 94, 976]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 820, 38, 951]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,80],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon, estimated to be around [80, 80], to the left of the \\'Downloads\\' title. This icon is currently visible. This action is intended to open a navigation drawer or menu, which should allow navigation to different storage locations and folders. Actual Outcome: The tap on the hamburger menu icon at [80, 80] successfully opened the navigation drawer. The drawer is now visible on the left side of the screen, showing various file categories and storage locations, including \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\". This action has brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to the target folder.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[542,331],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\" entry in the navigation drawer. The text \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\" is visible with bounding box [533, 150, 552, 512]. This action is expected to open the root directory of the \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\" storage, allowing further navigation to the \"Notifications\" folder. Actual Outcome: The tap on \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\" (at [542, 331], which corresponds to the text \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\" with bounding box [533, 150, 552, 512]) successfully navigated into the selected storage area. The screen now displays the root directory of \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\", showing various folders. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the \"Notifications\" folder is now accessible.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[558,271],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Notifications\" folder, which is visible on the screen with text \"Notifications\" and bounding box [550, 171, 565, 370]. This action is expected to open the \"Notifications\" folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The action was a tap on the \"Notifications\" folder, located at approximately [558, 271] (corresponding to the text \"Notifications\" with bounding box [550, 171, 565, 370]). This action successfully opened the \"Notifications\" folder. The screen now displays the files within the \"Notifications\" folder. This action brought the agent closer to completing the overall user instruction by successfully navigating to the target folder, thus completing Subgoal 2. The next step is to locate and attempt to delete the specified file within this folder.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down the list of files in the \"Notifications\" folder. This is done to check if the target file \"q2a8_fancy_banana.mp3\" is located further down the list, as it is not currently visible. The current screen shows a list of files, and it\\'s possible more files are present below the visible area. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the content of the \"Notifications\" folder downwards, revealing more files. The file \"edited_q2a8_fan...\", which is presumed to be the target file \"q2a8_fancy_banana.mp3\", is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the target file visible and accessible for interaction.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[866,314],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file \"edited_q2a8_fan...\" located at approximately [866, 314]. This file is currently visible with bounding box [849, 176, 884, 453]. This action is intended to select the file, which should then allow for deletion. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the file \"edited_q2a8_fan...\" was successful. The file is now selected, which is indicated by a blue highlight, a checkmark, and the text \"1 selected\" at the top of the screen. New icons, including a delete (trash can) icon and a share icon, have appeared at the top right. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the file is now ready to be deleted.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 11: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,821],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the delete icon (trash can) located at approximately [80, 821]. This icon is currently visible in the top right corner of the screen. This action is intended to initiate the deletion process for the selected file. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open File Manager App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"A file manager app (e.g., \\\\\"Files\\\\\") is open and displaying its main interface.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Swiped up from the home screen to open the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the target file visible and accessible for interaction.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[866,314],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file \"edited_q2a8_fan...\" located at approximately [866, 314]. This file is currently visible with bounding box [849, 176, 884, 453]. This action is intended to select the file, which should then allow for deletion. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the file \"edited_q2a8_fan...\" was successful. The file is now selected, which is indicated by a blue highlight, a checkmark, and the text \"1 selected\" at the top of the screen. New icons, including a delete (trash can) icon and a share icon, have appeared at the top right. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the file is now ready to be deleted.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,821],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the delete icon (trash can) located at approximately [80, 821]. This icon is currently visible in the top right corner of the screen. This action is intended to initiate the deletion process for the selected file. Actual Outcome: The tap on the delete icon (trash can) at approximately [80, 821] was successful. As a result, a confirmation dialog appeared on the screen, asking \"Delete \\\\\"edited_q2a8_fancy_banana.mp3\\\\\"?\" with \"CANCEL\" and \"OK\" options. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to confirm the deletion.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 44, 35, 131], \\'text\\': \\'15.41\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 65, 948], \\'text\\': \\'Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 205, 91, 379], \\'text\\': \\'selected\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [330, 177, 365, 439], \\'text\\': \\'2023_08_23_em. 21 B 15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [327, 625, 365, 876], \\'text\\': \\'app_alert_2023 21 B 15.34\\'}\", \\'{\\\\\\'box_2d\\\\\\': [480, 136, 523, 750], \\\\\\'text\\\\\\': \\\\\\'Delete \"edited_q2a8_fancy_banana.mp3\"?\\\\\\'}\\', \"{\\'box_2d\\': [541, 555, 557, 706], \\'text\\': \\'CANCEL\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [542, 792, 557, 849], \\'text\\': \\'OK\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [588, 175, 624, 457], \\'text\\': \\'backup_system __ 21 B 15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [588, 627, 624, 894], \\'text\\': \\'CHTU_sports_sc. 21 B 15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [847, 175, 884, 451], \\'text\\': \\'edited_q2a8_fan  21 B 15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [848, 626, 884, 892], \\'text\\': \\'edited_traffic_inf 21 B 15.34\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [644, 60, 899, 491]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [123, 62, 377, 489]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [124, 514, 378, 939]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [577, 57, 636, 492]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [644, 515, 897, 943]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [578, 505, 636, 942]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [449, 79, 578, 918]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [533, 754, 567, 879]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 156, 96, 383]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [904, 57, 999, 492]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [65, 675, 104, 742]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to open the root directory of the \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\" storage, allowing further navigation to the \"Notifications\" folder. Actual Outcome: The tap on \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\" (at [542, 331], which corresponds to the text \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\" with bounding box [533, 150, 552, 512]) successfully navigated into the selected storage area. The screen now displays the root directory of \"sdk_gphone64_x86_64\", showing various folders. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the \"Notifications\" folder is now accessible.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[558,271],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Notifications\" folder, which is visible on the screen with text \"Notifications\" and bounding box [550, 171, 565, 370]. This action is expected to open the \"Notifications\" folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The action was a tap on the \"Notifications\" folder, located at approximately [558, 271] (corresponding to the text \"Notifications\" with bounding box [550, 171, 565, 370]). This action successfully opened the \"Notifications\" folder. The screen now displays the files within the \"Notifications\" folder. This action brought the agent closer to completing the overall user instruction by successfully navigating to the target folder, thus completing Subgoal 2. The next step is to locate and attempt to delete the specified file within this folder.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down the list of files in the \"Notifications\" folder. This is done to check if the target file \"q2a8_fancy_banana.mp3\" is located further down the list, as it is not currently visible. The current screen shows a list of files, and it\\'s possible more files are present below the visible area. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the content of the \"Notifications\" folder downwards, revealing more files. The file \"edited_q2a8_fan...\", which is presumed to be the target file \"q2a8_fancy_banana.mp3\", is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the target file visible and accessible for interaction.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[866,314],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file \"edited_q2a8_fan...\" located at approximately [866, 314]. This file is currently visible with bounding box [849, 176, 884, 453]. This action is intended to select the file, which should then allow for deletion. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the file \"edited_q2a8_fan...\" was successful. The file is now selected, which is indicated by a blue highlight, a checkmark, and the text \"1 selected\" at the top of the screen. New icons, including a delete (trash can) icon and a share icon, have appeared at the top right. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the file is now ready to be deleted.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,821],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the delete icon (trash can) located at approximately [80, 821]. This icon is currently visible in the top right corner of the screen. This action is intended to initiate the deletion process for the selected file. Actual Outcome: The tap on the delete icon (trash can) at approximately [80, 821] was successful. As a result, a confirmation dialog appeared on the screen, asking \"Delete \\\\\"edited_q2a8_fancy_banana.mp3\\\\\"?\" with \"CANCEL\" and \"OK\" options. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to confirm the deletion.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 12: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.42\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 92, 503], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0 dY: 0.0 Xv: 0.0 Notifications\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [330, 177, 365, 438], \\'text\\': \\'2023_08_23_em. 21 B 15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [327, 625, 365, 876], \\'text\\': \\'app_alert_2023 21 B 15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [588, 175, 624, 462], \\'text\\': \\'backup_system __ 21 B 15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [589, 629, 624, 907], \\'text\\': \\'CHTU_sports_sc_ 21 B 15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [848, 177, 884, 444], \\'text\\': \\'edited_traffic_inf. 21 B 15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [848, 626, 884, 883], \\'text\\': \\'final_traffic_info. 21 B 15.34\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [124, 511, 378, 941]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [384, 59, 638, 490]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [645, 62, 898, 490]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [645, 513, 898, 942]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [904, 57, 1000, 494]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [904, 508, 1000, 946]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [65, 784, 96, 866]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 888, 95, 973]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 196, 37, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [13, 817, 39, 956]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",
