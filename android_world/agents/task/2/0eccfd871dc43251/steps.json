Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17.

To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button.

Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to reveal the list of installed applications, where I can then find and tap on the Markor app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen now displays a list of installed applications. The Markor app icon is visible among them. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Markor app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[868,615],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon, which is currently visible in the app drawer. This action is expected to open the Markor app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Markor app icon was successful. The Markor app opened, and its main file browser interface is now visible. This completes the first subgoal and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction. The next step is to find the option to create a new folder within the Markor app.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 2: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

This button is expected to reveal options for creating new items, hopefully including a \\'New Folder\\' option.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000.

Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to reveal the list of installed applications, where I can then find and tap on the Markor app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen now displays a list of installed applications. The Markor app icon is visible among them. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Markor app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

This action is expected to open the Markor app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Markor app icon was successful. The Markor app opened, and its main file browser interface is now visible. This completes the first subgoal and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction. The next step is to find the option to create a new folder within the Markor app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

This button is expected to reveal options for creating new items, hopefully including a \\'New Folder\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'+\\' button at [865, 894] successfully opened a \"Create new item\" dialog. The dialog has a \"Name\" field (pre-filled with \"my_note\"), a \"Type\" dropdown (currently \"Markdown\"), a \"Template\" dropdown (currently \"Empty file\"), and three buttons: \"FOLDER\", \"CANCEL\", and \"OK\". This action successfully identified the mechanism to create a folder (by using the \"FOLDER\" button in this dialog).

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9.

To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible.

This action is expected to reveal the list of installed applications, where I can then find and tap on the Markor app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen now displays a list of installed applications. The Markor app icon is visible among them. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Markor app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[868,615],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon, which is currently visible in the app drawer. This action is expected to open the Markor app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Markor app icon was successful. The Markor app opened, and its main file browser interface is now visible. This completes the first subgoal and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction. The next step is to find the option to create a new folder within the Markor app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[865,894],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the red floating action button with a \\'+\\' icon, located at approximately [865, 894]. This button is expected to reveal options for creating new items, hopefully including a \\'New Folder\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'+\\' button at [865, 894] successfully opened a \"Create new item\" dialog. The dialog has a \"Name\" field (pre-filled with \"my_note\"), a \"Type\" dropdown (currently \"Markdown\"), a \"Template\" dropdown (currently \"Empty file\"), and three buttons: \"FOLDER\", \"CANCEL\", and \"OK\". This action successfully identified the mechanism to create a folder (by using the \"FOLDER\" button in this dialog). The active subgoal \"Find \\'Create New Folder\\' Option in Markor\" is now completed.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 3: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[396,154],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' text field, which currently displays \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to focus the text field and allow text input. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main interface is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

This action is expected to reveal the list of installed applications, where I can then find and tap on the Markor app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen now displays a list of installed applications. The Markor app icon is visible among them. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Markor app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[868,615],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon, which is currently visible in the app drawer. This action is expected to open the Markor app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Markor app icon was successful. The Markor app opened, and its main file browser interface is now visible. This completes the first subgoal and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction. The next step is to find the option to create a new folder within the Markor app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[865,894],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the red floating action button with a \\'+\\' icon, located at approximately [865, 894]. This button is expected to reveal options for creating new items, hopefully including a \\'New Folder\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'+\\' button at [865, 894] successfully opened a \"Create new item\" dialog. The dialog has a \"Name\" field (pre-filled with \"my_note\"), a \"Type\" dropdown (currently \"Markdown\"), a \"Template\" dropdown (currently \"Empty file\"), and three buttons: \"FOLDER\", \"CANCEL\", and \"OK\". This action successfully identified the mechanism to create a folder (by using the \"FOLDER\" button in this dialog). The active subgoal \"Find \\'Create New Folder\\' Option in Markor\" is now completed.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[396,154],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' text field, which currently displays \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to focus the text field and allow text input. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Name\\' text field at [396,154] failed. Instead of focusing the text field, an error dialog titled \"com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\" appeared. This dialog has options \"App info\" and \"Close app\". The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal; it introduced an error that needs to be handled.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13.

Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

This action is expected to reveal the list of installed applications, where I can then find and tap on the Markor app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen now displays a list of installed applications. The Markor app icon is visible among them. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Markor app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[868,615],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon, which is currently visible in the app drawer. This action is expected to open the Markor app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Markor app icon was successful. The Markor app opened, and its main file browser interface is now visible. This completes the first subgoal and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction. The next step is to find the option to create a new folder within the Markor app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[865,894],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the red floating action button with a \\'+\\' icon, located at approximately [865, 894]. This button is expected to reveal options for creating new items, hopefully including a \\'New Folder\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'+\\' button at [865, 894] successfully opened a \"Create new item\" dialog. The dialog has a \"Name\" field (pre-filled with \"my_note\"), a \"Type\" dropdown (currently \"Markdown\"), a \"Template\" dropdown (currently \"Empty file\"), and three buttons: \"FOLDER\", \"CANCEL\", and \"OK\". This action successfully identified the mechanism to create a folder (by using the \"FOLDER\" button in this dialog). The active subgoal \"Find \\'Create New Folder\\' Option in Markor\" is now completed.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[396,154],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' text field, which currently displays \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to focus the text field and allow text input. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Name\\' text field at [396,154] failed. Instead of focusing the text field, an error dialog titled \"com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\" appeared. This dialog has options \"App info\" and \"Close app\". The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal; it introduced an error that needs to be handled.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 4: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Close app\\' button in the error dialog. The error dialog is titled \\'com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\\'. This action is expected to close the error dialog and reveal the underlying \\'Create new item\\' dialog.

Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to reveal the list of installed applications, where I can then find and tap on the Markor app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen now displays a list of installed applications. The Markor app icon is visible among them. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Markor app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[868,615],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon, which is currently visible in the app drawer. This action is expected to open the Markor app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Markor app icon was successful. The Markor app opened, and its main file browser interface is now visible. This completes the first subgoal and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction. The next step is to find the option to create a new folder within the Markor app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[865,894],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the red floating action button with a \\'+\\' icon, located at approximately [865, 894]. This button is expected to reveal options for creating new items, hopefully including a \\'New Folder\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'+\\' button at [865, 894] successfully opened a \"Create new item\" dialog. The dialog has a \"Name\" field (pre-filled with \"my_note\"), a \"Type\" dropdown (currently \"Markdown\"), a \"Template\" dropdown (currently \"Empty file\"), and three buttons: \"FOLDER\", \"CANCEL\", and \"OK\". This action successfully identified the mechanism to create a folder (by using the \"FOLDER\" button in this dialog). The active subgoal \"Find \\'Create New Folder\\' Option in Markor\" is now completed.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[396,154],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' text field, which currently displays \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to focus the text field and allow text input. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Name\\' text field at [396,154] failed. Instead of focusing the text field, an error dialog titled \"com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\" appeared. This dialog has options \"App info\" and \"Close app\". The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal; it introduced an error that needs to be handled.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Close app\\' button in the error dialog. The error dialog is titled \\'com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\\'. This action is expected to close the error dialog and reveal the underlying \\'Create new item\\' dialog. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Close app\\' button on the error dialog was successful. The error dialog was dismissed, and the \\'Create new item\\' dialog is now visible and interactive. This action has brought the agent back on track to complete the active subgoal. The next step is to tap the \\'Name\\' text field to input the desired folder name.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

This action is expected to reveal the list of installed applications, where I can then find and tap on the Markor app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen now displays a list of installed applications. The Markor app icon is visible among them. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Markor app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[868,615],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon, which is currently visible in the app drawer. This action is expected to open the Markor app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Markor app icon was successful. The Markor app opened, and its main file browser interface is now visible. This completes the first subgoal and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction. The next step is to find the option to create a new folder within the Markor app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[865,894],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the red floating action button with a \\'+\\' icon, located at approximately [865, 894]. This button is expected to reveal options for creating new items, hopefully including a \\'New Folder\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'+\\' button at [865, 894] successfully opened a \"Create new item\" dialog. The dialog has a \"Name\" field (pre-filled with \"my_note\"), a \"Type\" dropdown (currently \"Markdown\"), a \"Template\" dropdown (currently \"Empty file\"), and three buttons: \"FOLDER\", \"CANCEL\", and \"OK\". This action successfully identified the mechanism to create a folder (by using the \"FOLDER\" button in this dialog).

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This completes the first subgoal and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction. The next step is to find the option to create a new folder within the Markor app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

This button is expected to reveal options for creating new items, hopefully including a \\'New Folder\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'+\\' button at [865, 894] successfully opened a \"Create new item\" dialog. The dialog has a \"Name\" field (pre-filled with \"my_note\"), a \"Type\" dropdown (currently \"Markdown\"), a \"Template\" dropdown (currently \"Empty file\"), and three buttons: \"FOLDER\", \"CANCEL\", and \"OK\". This action successfully identified the mechanism to create a folder (by using the \"FOLDER\" button in this dialog).

Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text.

When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nCreate a new folder in Markor named folder_20250514_085404.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[868,615],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon, which is currently visible in the app drawer. This action is expected to open the Markor app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Markor app icon was successful. The Markor app opened, and its main file browser interface is now visible. This completes the first subgoal and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction. The next step is to find the option to create a new folder within the Markor app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[865,894],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the red floating action button with a \\'+\\' icon, located at approximately [865, 894]. This button is expected to reveal options for creating new items, hopefully including a \\'New Folder\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'+\\' button at [865, 894] successfully opened a \"Create new item\" dialog. The dialog has a \"Name\" field (pre-filled with \"my_note\"), a \"Type\" dropdown (currently \"Markdown\"), a \"Template\" dropdown (currently \"Empty file\"), and three buttons: \"FOLDER\", \"CANCEL\", and \"OK\". This action successfully identified the mechanism to create a folder (by using the \"FOLDER\" button in this dialog). The active subgoal \"Find \\'Create New Folder\\' Option in Markor\" is now completed.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[396,154],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' text field, which currently displays \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to focus the text field and allow text input. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Name\\' text field at [396,154] failed. Instead of focusing the text field, an error dialog titled \"com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\" appeared. This dialog has options \"App info\" and \"Close app\". The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal; it introduced an error that needs to be handled.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Close app\\' button in the error dialog. The error dialog is titled \\'com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\\'. This action is expected to close the error dialog and reveal the underlying \\'Create new item\\' dialog. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Close app\\' button on the error dialog was successful. The error dialog was dismissed, and the \\'Create new item\\' dialog is now visible and interactive. This action has brought the agent back on track to complete the active subgoal. The next step is to tap the \\'Name\\' text field to input the desired folder name.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[396,154],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' text field, which currently displays \\'my_note\\'. The bounding box for \\'Name my_note\\' is [380, 78, 413, 230]. The tap will be at [396, 154]. This action is expected to focus the text field and allow text input. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Name\\' text field at [396, 154] was successful. The \\'Name\\' text field, which contained \"my_note\", is now focused and ready for text input. This is visually confirmed by the underlined text \"my_note\" and the appearance of \"ADB Keyboard (ON)\" at the bottom of the screen. The system\\'s accessibility information also confirms that the EditText field is focused. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the new folder.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 6: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the currently focused \\'Name\\' text field. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to clear the text field, making it ready for new input. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main interface is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

In the dialog that appears, input the folder name in the \\'Name\\' field, then tap the \\'FOLDER\\' button.\",\"Status\":\"A complete piece of information.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The error dialog was dismissed, and the \\'Create new item\\' dialog is now visible and interactive. This action has brought the agent back on track to complete the active subgoal. The next step is to tap the \\'Name\\' text field to input the desired folder name.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[396,154],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' text field, which currently displays \\'my_note\\'. The bounding box for \\'Name my_note\\' is [380, 78, 413, 230]. The tap will be at [396, 154]. This action is expected to focus the text field and allow text input. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Name\\' text field at [396, 154] was successful. The \\'Name\\' text field, which contained \"my_note\", is now focused and ready for text input. This is visually confirmed by the underlined text \"my_note\" and the appearance of \"ADB Keyboard (ON)\" at the bottom of the screen. The system\\'s accessibility information also confirms that the EditText field is focused. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the new folder.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the currently focused \\'Name\\' text field. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to clear the text field, making it ready for new input. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' failed. The text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' field was not deleted. The \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) remains focused and still contains \\'my_note\\'. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To proceed, the existing text must be deleted using an alternative method before the new folder name can be entered.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[865,894],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the red floating action button with a \\'+\\' icon, located at approximately [865, 894]. This button is expected to reveal options for creating new items, hopefully including a \\'New Folder\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'+\\' button at [865, 894] successfully opened a \"Create new item\" dialog. The dialog has a \"Name\" field (pre-filled with \"my_note\"), a \"Type\" dropdown (currently \"Markdown\"), a \"Template\" dropdown (currently \"Empty file\"), and three buttons: \"FOLDER\", \"CANCEL\", and \"OK\". This action successfully identified the mechanism to create a folder (by using the \"FOLDER\" button in this dialog). The active subgoal \"Find \\'Create New Folder\\' Option in Markor\" is now completed.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[396,154],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' text field, which currently displays \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to focus the text field and allow text input. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Name\\' text field at [396,154] failed. Instead of focusing the text field, an error dialog titled \"com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\" appeared. This dialog has options \"App info\" and \"Close app\". The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal; it introduced an error that needs to be handled.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Close app\\' button in the error dialog. The error dialog is titled \\'com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\\'. This action is expected to close the error dialog and reveal the underlying \\'Create new item\\' dialog. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Close app\\' button on the error dialog was successful. The error dialog was dismissed, and the \\'Create new item\\' dialog is now visible and interactive. This action has brought the agent back on track to complete the active subgoal. The next step is to tap the \\'Name\\' text field to input the desired folder name.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[396,154],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' text field, which currently displays \\'my_note\\'. The bounding box for \\'Name my_note\\' is [380, 78, 413, 230]. The tap will be at [396, 154]. This action is expected to focus the text field and allow text input. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Name\\' text field at [396, 154] was successful. The \\'Name\\' text field, which contained \"my_note\", is now focused and ready for text input. This is visually confirmed by the underlined text \"my_note\" and the appearance of \"ADB Keyboard (ON)\" at the bottom of the screen. The system\\'s accessibility information also confirms that the EditText field is focused. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the new folder.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the currently focused \\'Name\\' text field. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to clear the text field, making it ready for new input. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' failed. The text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' field was not deleted. The \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) remains focused and still contains \\'my_note\\'. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To proceed, the existing text must be deleted using an alternative method before the new folder name can be entered.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 7: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a KEYCODE_DEL event to delete one character from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. This will be repeated 7 times to delete all characters of \\'my_note\\'. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the field. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main interface is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

This action is expected to focus the text field and allow text input. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Name\\' text field at [396,154] failed. Instead of focusing the text field, an error dialog titled \"com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\" appeared. This dialog has options \"App info\" and \"Close app\". The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal; it introduced an error that needs to be handled.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Close app\\' button in the error dialog. The error dialog is titled \\'com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\\'. This action is expected to close the error dialog and reveal the underlying \\'Create new item\\' dialog. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Close app\\' button on the error dialog was successful. The error dialog was dismissed, and the \\'Create new item\\' dialog is now visible and interactive. This action has brought the agent back on track to complete the active subgoal. The next step is to tap the \\'Name\\' text field to input the desired folder name.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[396,154],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' text field, which currently displays \\'my_note\\'. The bounding box for \\'Name my_note\\' is [380, 78, 413, 230]. The tap will be at [396, 154]. This action is expected to focus the text field and allow text input. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Name\\' text field at [396, 154] was successful. The \\'Name\\' text field, which contained \"my_note\", is now focused and ready for text input. This is visually confirmed by the underlined text \"my_note\" and the appearance of \"ADB Keyboard (ON)\" at the bottom of the screen. The system\\'s accessibility information also confirms that the EditText field is focused. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the new folder.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the currently focused \\'Name\\' text field. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to clear the text field, making it ready for new input. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' failed. The text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' field was not deleted. The \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) remains focused and still contains \\'my_note\\'. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To proceed, the existing text must be deleted using an alternative method before the new folder name can be entered.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a KEYCODE_DEL event to delete one character from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. This will be repeated 7 times to delete all characters of \\'my_note\\'. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the field. Actual Outcome: The action of sending a `KEYCODE_DEL` key event failed. The text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' field was not deleted or altered in any way. The \\'Name\\' field remains focused and still contains \\'my_note\\'. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. Alternative methods for deleting the text are needed.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The error dialog is titled \\'com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\\'. This action is expected to close the error dialog and reveal the underlying \\'Create new item\\' dialog. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Close app\\' button on the error dialog was successful. The error dialog was dismissed, and the \\'Create new item\\' dialog is now visible and interactive. This action has brought the agent back on track to complete the active subgoal. The next step is to tap the \\'Name\\' text field to input the desired folder name.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[396,154],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' text field, which currently displays \\'my_note\\'. The bounding box for \\'Name my_note\\' is [380, 78, 413, 230]. The tap will be at [396, 154]. This action is expected to focus the text field and allow text input. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Name\\' text field at [396, 154] was successful. The \\'Name\\' text field, which contained \"my_note\", is now focused and ready for text input. This is visually confirmed by the underlined text \"my_note\" and the appearance of \"ADB Keyboard (ON)\" at the bottom of the screen. The system\\'s accessibility information also confirms that the EditText field is focused. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the new folder.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the currently focused \\'Name\\' text field. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to clear the text field, making it ready for new input. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' failed. The text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' field was not deleted. The \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) remains focused and still contains \\'my_note\\'. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To proceed, the existing text must be deleted using an alternative method before the new folder name can be entered.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a KEYCODE_DEL event to delete one character from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. This will be repeated 7 times to delete all characters of \\'my_note\\'. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the field. Actual Outcome: The action of sending a `KEYCODE_DEL` key event failed. The text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' field was not deleted or altered in any way. The \\'Name\\' field remains focused and still contains \\'my_note\\'. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.

In the dialog that appears, input the folder name in the \\'Name\\' field, then tap the \\'FOLDER\\' button.\",\"Status\":\"A complete piece of information.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Close app\\' button in the error dialog. The error dialog is titled \\'com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\\'. This action is expected to close the error dialog and reveal the underlying \\'Create new item\\' dialog. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Close app\\' button on the error dialog was successful. The error dialog was dismissed, and the \\'Create new item\\' dialog is now visible and interactive. This action has brought the agent back on track to complete the active subgoal. The next step is to tap the \\'Name\\' text field to input the desired folder name.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[396,154],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' text field, which currently displays \\'my_note\\'. The bounding box for \\'Name my_note\\' is [380, 78, 413, 230]. The tap will be at [396, 154]. This action is expected to focus the text field and allow text input. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Name\\' text field at [396, 154] was successful. The \\'Name\\' text field, which contained \"my_note\", is now focused and ready for text input. This is visually confirmed by the underlined text \"my_note\" and the appearance of \"ADB Keyboard (ON)\" at the bottom of the screen. The system\\'s accessibility information also confirms that the EditText field is focused. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the new folder.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the currently focused \\'Name\\' text field. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to clear the text field, making it ready for new input. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' failed. The text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' field was not deleted. The \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) remains focused and still contains \\'my_note\\'. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To proceed, the existing text must be deleted using an alternative method before the new folder name can be entered.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a KEYCODE_DEL event to delete one character from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. This will be repeated 7 times to delete all characters of \\'my_note\\'. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the field. Actual Outcome: The action of sending a `KEYCODE_DEL` key event failed. The text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' field was not deleted or altered in any way. The \\'Name\\' field remains focused and still contains \\'my_note\\'. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. Alternative methods for deleting the text are needed.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_FORWARD_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a `KEYCODE_FORWARD_DEL` key event to attempt to delete one character from the focused \\'Name\\' text field, which currently contains \\'my_note\\'. This is an attempt to clear the field before entering the new folder name. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused. Actual Outcome: The action of sending a `KEYCODE_FORWARD_DEL` key event failed. The text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' field was not deleted or altered. The \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) remains focused and still contains \\'my_note\\'. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. Alternative methods for deleting the text are needed.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 9: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[372,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' field. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. The approximate center of \\'my_note\\' is [372, 153]. This action is expected to bring up a context menu with options like \\'Select All\\', \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', or \\'Paste\\', which can then be used to delete the text. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main interface is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16.

The bounding box for \\'Name my_note\\' is [380, 78, 413, 230]. The tap will be at [396, 154]. This action is expected to focus the text field and allow text input. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Name\\' text field at [396, 154] was successful. The \\'Name\\' text field, which contained \"my_note\", is now focused and ready for text input. This is visually confirmed by the underlined text \"my_note\" and the appearance of \"ADB Keyboard (ON)\" at the bottom of the screen. The system\\'s accessibility information also confirms that the EditText field is focused. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the new folder.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the currently focused \\'Name\\' text field. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to clear the text field, making it ready for new input. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' failed. The text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' field was not deleted. The \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) remains focused and still contains \\'my_note\\'. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To proceed, the existing text must be deleted using an alternative method before the new folder name can be entered.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a KEYCODE_DEL event to delete one character from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. This will be repeated 7 times to delete all characters of \\'my_note\\'. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the field. Actual Outcome: The action of sending a `KEYCODE_DEL` key event failed. The text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' field was not deleted or altered in any way. The \\'Name\\' field remains focused and still contains \\'my_note\\'. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. Alternative methods for deleting the text are needed.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_FORWARD_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a `KEYCODE_FORWARD_DEL` key event to attempt to delete one character from the focused \\'Name\\' text field, which currently contains \\'my_note\\'. This is an attempt to clear the field before entering the new folder name. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused. Actual Outcome: The action of sending a `KEYCODE_FORWARD_DEL` key event failed. The text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' field was not deleted or altered. The \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) remains focused and still contains \\'my_note\\'. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. Alternative methods for deleting the text are needed.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[372,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' field. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. The approximate center of \\'my_note\\' is [372, 153]. This action is expected to bring up a context menu with options like \\'Select All\\', \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', or \\'Paste\\', which can then be used to delete the text. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the \\'Name\\' field (containing \\'my_note\\') was successful. A context menu appeared above the text field, showing \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing a new avenue to manipulate the text in the field, which is necessary before inputting the desired folder name.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The bounding box for \\'Name my_note\\' is [380, 78, 413, 230]. The tap will be at [396, 154]. This action is expected to focus the text field and allow text input. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Name\\' text field at [396, 154] was successful. The \\'Name\\' text field, which contained \"my_note\", is now focused and ready for text input. This is visually confirmed by the underlined text \"my_note\" and the appearance of \"ADB Keyboard (ON)\" at the bottom of the screen. The system\\'s accessibility information also confirms that the EditText field is focused. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the new folder.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the currently focused \\'Name\\' text field. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to clear the text field, making it ready for new input. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' failed. The text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' field was not deleted. The \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) remains focused and still contains \\'my_note\\'. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To proceed, the existing text must be deleted using an alternative method before the new folder name can be entered.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a KEYCODE_DEL event to delete one character from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. This will be repeated 7 times to delete all characters of \\'my_note\\'. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the field. Actual Outcome: The action of sending a `KEYCODE_DEL` key event failed. The text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' field was not deleted or altered in any way. The \\'Name\\' field remains focused and still contains \\'my_note\\'. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. Alternative methods for deleting the text are needed.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_FORWARD_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a `KEYCODE_FORWARD_DEL` key event to attempt to delete one character from the focused \\'Name\\' text field, which currently contains \\'my_note\\'. This is an attempt to clear the field before entering the new folder name. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused. Actual Outcome: The action of sending a `KEYCODE_FORWARD_DEL` key event failed. The text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' field was not deleted or altered. The \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) remains focused and still contains \\'my_note\\'. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. Alternative methods for deleting the text are needed.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[372,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' field. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. The approximate center of \\'my_note\\' is [372, 153]. This action is expected to bring up a context menu with options like \\'Select All\\', \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', or \\'Paste\\', which can then be used to delete the text. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the \\'Name\\' field (containing \\'my_note\\') was successful. A context menu appeared above the text field, showing \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing a new avenue to manipulate the text in the field, which is necessary before inputting the desired folder name.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 10: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[405,210],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot icon in the context menu. The context menu currently shows \\'Paste\\' and the three-dot icon. The three-dot icon is located to the right of \\'Paste\\'. Tapping this icon is expected to reveal more options for text manipulation, such as \\'Select All\\', \\'Cut\\', or \\'Delete\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main interface is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the currently focused \\'Name\\' text field. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to clear the text field, making it ready for new input. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' failed. The text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' field was not deleted. The \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) remains focused and still contains \\'my_note\\'. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To proceed, the existing text must be deleted using an alternative method before the new folder name can be entered.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a KEYCODE_DEL event to delete one character from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. This will be repeated 7 times to delete all characters of \\'my_note\\'. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the field. Actual Outcome: The action of sending a `KEYCODE_DEL` key event failed. The text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' field was not deleted or altered in any way. The \\'Name\\' field remains focused and still contains \\'my_note\\'. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. Alternative methods for deleting the text are needed.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_FORWARD_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a `KEYCODE_FORWARD_DEL` key event to attempt to delete one character from the focused \\'Name\\' text field, which currently contains \\'my_note\\'. This is an attempt to clear the field before entering the new folder name. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused. Actual Outcome: The action of sending a `KEYCODE_FORWARD_DEL` key event failed. The text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' field was not deleted or altered. The \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) remains focused and still contains \\'my_note\\'. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. Alternative methods for deleting the text are needed.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[372,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' field. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. The approximate center of \\'my_note\\' is [372, 153]. This action is expected to bring up a context menu with options like \\'Select All\\', \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', or \\'Paste\\', which can then be used to delete the text. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the \\'Name\\' field (containing \\'my_note\\') was successful. A context menu appeared above the text field, showing \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing a new avenue to manipulate the text in the field, which is necessary before inputting the desired folder name.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[405,210],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot icon in the context menu. The context menu currently shows \\'Paste\\' and the three-dot icon. The three-dot icon is located to the right of \\'Paste\\'. Tapping this icon is expected to reveal more options for text manipulation, such as \\'Select All\\', \\'Cut\\', or \\'Delete\\'. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping the three-dot icon ([405, 210]) in the context menu, was successful in interacting with the UI. It changed the context menu from displaying [\\'Paste\\', \\'...\\'] to displaying [\\'Autofill\\', back_arrow_icon]. However, this outcome did not directly bring the agent closer to deleting the text \\'my_note\\', as the new menu options are not for deletion. The \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) remains focused and still contains \\'my_note\\'. Further actions are needed to clear this field.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 11: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[372,160],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon in the \\'Autofill\\' context menu. The context menu currently shows \\'Autofill\\' and a back arrow. The back arrow is located to the left of \\'Autofill\\', visually estimated at `[372, 160]`. This action is expected to close the \\'Autofill\\' menu, potentially returning to the previous context menu or closing the context menu altogether, allowing further steps to delete the text \\'my_note\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main interface is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16.

This will be repeated 7 times to delete all characters of \\'my_note\\'. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the field. Actual Outcome: The action of sending a `KEYCODE_DEL` key event failed. The text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' field was not deleted or altered in any way. The \\'Name\\' field remains focused and still contains \\'my_note\\'.

This is an attempt to clear the field before entering the new folder name. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused. Actual Outcome: The action of sending a `KEYCODE_FORWARD_DEL` key event failed. The text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' field was not deleted or altered. The \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) remains focused and still contains \\'my_note\\'. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. Alternative methods for deleting the text are needed.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[372,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' field. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. The approximate center of \\'my_note\\' is [372, 153]. This action is expected to bring up a context menu with options like \\'Select All\\', \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', or \\'Paste\\', which can then be used to delete the text. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the \\'Name\\' field (containing \\'my_note\\') was successful. A context menu appeared above the text field, showing \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing a new avenue to manipulate the text in the field, which is necessary before inputting the desired folder name.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[405,210],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot icon in the context menu. The context menu currently shows \\'Paste\\' and the three-dot icon. The three-dot icon is located to the right of \\'Paste\\'. Tapping this icon is expected to reveal more options for text manipulation, such as \\'Select All\\', \\'Cut\\', or \\'Delete\\'. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping the three-dot icon ([405, 210]) in the context menu, was successful in interacting with the UI. It changed the context menu from displaying [\\'Paste\\', \\'...\\'] to displaying [\\'Autofill\\', back_arrow_icon]. However, this outcome did not directly bring the agent closer to deleting the text \\'my_note\\', as the new menu options are not for deletion. The \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) remains focused and still contains \\'my_note\\'. Further actions are needed to clear this field.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[372,160],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon in the \\'Autofill\\' context menu. The context menu currently shows \\'Autofill\\' and a back arrow. The back arrow is located to the left of \\'Autofill\\', visually estimated at `[372, 160]`. This action is expected to close the \\'Autofill\\' menu, potentially returning to the previous context menu or closing the context menu altogether, allowing further steps to delete the text \\'my_note\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon (visually estimated at [372,160]) in the \\'Autofill\\' context menu was successful in that the \\'Autofill\\' context menu disappeared from the screen. However, the text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) was not deleted, and the field remains focused with this text. A toast message \"Contents can\\'t be autofilled\" appeared at the bottom of the screen. This action did not directly bring the agent closer to deleting the text, but it cleared the context menu, allowing for other interactions with the text field. The next step is to attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' for deletion.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nCreate a new folder in Markor named folder_20250514_085404.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a KEYCODE_DEL event to delete one character from the focused \\'Name\\' text field. This will be repeated 7 times to delete all characters of \\'my_note\\'. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the field. Actual Outcome: The action of sending a `KEYCODE_DEL` key event failed. The text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' field was not deleted or altered in any way. The \\'Name\\' field remains focused and still contains \\'my_note\\'. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. Alternative methods for deleting the text are needed.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_FORWARD_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a `KEYCODE_FORWARD_DEL` key event to attempt to delete one character from the focused \\'Name\\' text field, which currently contains \\'my_note\\'. This is an attempt to clear the field before entering the new folder name. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused. Actual Outcome: The action of sending a `KEYCODE_FORWARD_DEL` key event failed. The text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' field was not deleted or altered. The \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) remains focused and still contains \\'my_note\\'. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. Alternative methods for deleting the text are needed.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[372,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' field. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. The approximate center of \\'my_note\\' is [372, 153]. This action is expected to bring up a context menu with options like \\'Select All\\', \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', or \\'Paste\\', which can then be used to delete the text. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the \\'Name\\' field (containing \\'my_note\\') was successful. A context menu appeared above the text field, showing \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing a new avenue to manipulate the text in the field, which is necessary before inputting the desired folder name.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[405,210],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot icon in the context menu. The context menu currently shows \\'Paste\\' and the three-dot icon. The three-dot icon is located to the right of \\'Paste\\'. Tapping this icon is expected to reveal more options for text manipulation, such as \\'Select All\\', \\'Cut\\', or \\'Delete\\'. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping the three-dot icon ([405, 210]) in the context menu, was successful in interacting with the UI. It changed the context menu from displaying [\\'Paste\\', \\'...\\'] to displaying [\\'Autofill\\', back_arrow_icon]. However, this outcome did not directly bring the agent closer to deleting the text \\'my_note\\', as the new menu options are not for deletion. The \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) remains focused and still contains \\'my_note\\'. Further actions are needed to clear this field.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[372,160],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon in the \\'Autofill\\' context menu. The context menu currently shows \\'Autofill\\' and a back arrow. The back arrow is located to the left of \\'Autofill\\', visually estimated at `[372, 160]`. This action is expected to close the \\'Autofill\\' menu, potentially returning to the previous context menu or closing the context menu altogether, allowing further steps to delete the text \\'my_note\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon (visually estimated at [372,160]) in the \\'Autofill\\' context menu was successful in that the \\'Autofill\\' context menu disappeared from the screen. However, the text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) was not deleted, and the field remains focused with this text. A toast message \"Contents can\\'t be autofilled\" appeared at the bottom of the screen. This action did not directly bring the agent closer to deleting the text, but it cleared the context menu, allowing for other interactions with the text field. The next step is to attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' for deletion.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 12: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[372,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Double tap on the text \\'my_note\\' (at coordinates [372, 153]) in the \\'Name\\' field. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted in a subsequent step. This is a double tap, so it will be executed as two taps in quick succession. The first tap is described here. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main interface is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

In the dialog that appears, input the folder name in the \\'Name\\' field, then tap the \\'FOLDER\\' button.\",\"Status\":\"A complete piece of information.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is an attempt to clear the field before entering the new folder name. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused. Actual Outcome: The action of sending a `KEYCODE_FORWARD_DEL` key event failed. The text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' field was not deleted or altered. The \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) remains focused and still contains \\'my_note\\'. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. Alternative methods for deleting the text are needed.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[372,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' field. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. The approximate center of \\'my_note\\' is [372, 153]. This action is expected to bring up a context menu with options like \\'Select All\\', \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', or \\'Paste\\', which can then be used to delete the text. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the \\'Name\\' field (containing \\'my_note\\') was successful. A context menu appeared above the text field, showing \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing a new avenue to manipulate the text in the field, which is necessary before inputting the desired folder name.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[405,210],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot icon in the context menu. The context menu currently shows \\'Paste\\' and the three-dot icon. The three-dot icon is located to the right of \\'Paste\\'. Tapping this icon is expected to reveal more options for text manipulation, such as \\'Select All\\', \\'Cut\\', or \\'Delete\\'. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping the three-dot icon ([405, 210]) in the context menu, was successful in interacting with the UI. It changed the context menu from displaying [\\'Paste\\', \\'...\\'] to displaying [\\'Autofill\\', back_arrow_icon]. However, this outcome did not directly bring the agent closer to deleting the text \\'my_note\\', as the new menu options are not for deletion. The \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) remains focused and still contains \\'my_note\\'. Further actions are needed to clear this field.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[372,160],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon in the \\'Autofill\\' context menu. The context menu currently shows \\'Autofill\\' and a back arrow. The back arrow is located to the left of \\'Autofill\\', visually estimated at `[372, 160]`. This action is expected to close the \\'Autofill\\' menu, potentially returning to the previous context menu or closing the context menu altogether, allowing further steps to delete the text \\'my_note\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon (visually estimated at [372,160]) in the \\'Autofill\\' context menu was successful in that the \\'Autofill\\' context menu disappeared from the screen. However, the text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) was not deleted, and the field remains focused with this text. A toast message \"Contents can\\'t be autofilled\" appeared at the bottom of the screen. This action did not directly bring the agent closer to deleting the text, but it cleared the context menu, allowing for other interactions with the text field. The next step is to attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' for deletion.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[372,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Double tap on the text \\'my_note\\' (at coordinates [372, 153]) in the \\'Name\\' field. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted in a subsequent step. This is a double tap, so it will be executed as two taps in quick succession. The first tap is described here. Actual Outcome: The last action was a tap on the text \\'my_note\\' at coordinates [372, 153]. This was intended as the first of two taps to perform a double tap to select the text. The action did not visibly select the text \\'my_note\\'. The text field remains focused with \\'my_note\\' in it. The toast message \\'Contents can\\'t be autofilled\\' from a prior step is no longer visible. This action, being only the first part of an intended double tap, has not yet achieved text selection, but it is a step in the planned sequence. The double tap is not yet complete.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 13: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[372,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the second tap of the double tap on the text \\'my_note\\' (at coordinates [372, 153]) in the \\'Name\\' field. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted in a subsequent step.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[372,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' field. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. The approximate center of \\'my_note\\' is [372, 153]. This action is expected to bring up a context menu with options like \\'Select All\\', \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', or \\'Paste\\', which can then be used to delete the text. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the \\'Name\\' field (containing \\'my_note\\') was successful. A context menu appeared above the text field, showing \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing a new avenue to manipulate the text in the field, which is necessary before inputting the desired folder name.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[405,210],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot icon in the context menu. The context menu currently shows \\'Paste\\' and the three-dot icon. The three-dot icon is located to the right of \\'Paste\\'. Tapping this icon is expected to reveal more options for text manipulation, such as \\'Select All\\', \\'Cut\\', or \\'Delete\\'. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping the three-dot icon ([405, 210]) in the context menu, was successful in interacting with the UI. It changed the context menu from displaying [\\'Paste\\', \\'...\\'] to displaying [\\'Autofill\\', back_arrow_icon]. However, this outcome did not directly bring the agent closer to deleting the text \\'my_note\\', as the new menu options are not for deletion. The \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) remains focused and still contains \\'my_note\\'. Further actions are needed to clear this field.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[372,160],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon in the \\'Autofill\\' context menu. The context menu currently shows \\'Autofill\\' and a back arrow. The back arrow is located to the left of \\'Autofill\\', visually estimated at `[372, 160]`. This action is expected to close the \\'Autofill\\' menu, potentially returning to the previous context menu or closing the context menu altogether, allowing further steps to delete the text \\'my_note\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon (visually estimated at [372,160]) in the \\'Autofill\\' context menu was successful in that the \\'Autofill\\' context menu disappeared from the screen. However, the text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) was not deleted, and the field remains focused with this text. A toast message \"Contents can\\'t be autofilled\" appeared at the bottom of the screen. This action did not directly bring the agent closer to deleting the text, but it cleared the context menu, allowing for other interactions with the text field. The next step is to attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' for deletion.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[372,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Double tap on the text \\'my_note\\' (at coordinates [372, 153]) in the \\'Name\\' field. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted in a subsequent step. This is a double tap, so it will be executed as two taps in quick succession. The first tap is described here. Actual Outcome: The last action was a tap on the text \\'my_note\\' at coordinates [372, 153]. This was intended as the first of two taps to perform a double tap to select the text. The action did not visibly select the text \\'my_note\\'. The text field remains focused with \\'my_note\\' in it. The toast message \\'Contents can\\'t be autofilled\\' from a prior step is no longer visible. This action, being only the first part of an intended double tap, has not yet achieved text selection, but it is a step in the planned sequence. The double tap is not yet complete.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[372,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the second tap of the double tap on the text \\'my_note\\' (at coordinates [372, 153]) in the \\'Name\\' field. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted in a subsequent step. Actual Outcome: The last action, the second tap of a double tap on \\'my_note\\' at [372, 153], failed to select the text. The text \\'my_note\\' remains in the \\'Name\\' field, and it is not highlighted or otherwise marked as selected. The screen appearance did not change. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the text still needs to be cleared before entering the desired folder name.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nCreate a new folder in Markor named folder_20250514_085404.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[372,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' field. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. The approximate center of \\'my_note\\' is [372, 153]. This action is expected to bring up a context menu with options like \\'Select All\\', \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', or \\'Paste\\', which can then be used to delete the text. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the \\'Name\\' field (containing \\'my_note\\') was successful. A context menu appeared above the text field, showing \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing a new avenue to manipulate the text in the field, which is necessary before inputting the desired folder name.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[405,210],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot icon in the context menu. The context menu currently shows \\'Paste\\' and the three-dot icon. The three-dot icon is located to the right of \\'Paste\\'. Tapping this icon is expected to reveal more options for text manipulation, such as \\'Select All\\', \\'Cut\\', or \\'Delete\\'. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping the three-dot icon ([405, 210]) in the context menu, was successful in interacting with the UI. It changed the context menu from displaying [\\'Paste\\', \\'...\\'] to displaying [\\'Autofill\\', back_arrow_icon]. However, this outcome did not directly bring the agent closer to deleting the text \\'my_note\\', as the new menu options are not for deletion. The \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) remains focused and still contains \\'my_note\\'. Further actions are needed to clear this field.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[372,160],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon in the \\'Autofill\\' context menu. The context menu currently shows \\'Autofill\\' and a back arrow. The back arrow is located to the left of \\'Autofill\\', visually estimated at `[372, 160]`. This action is expected to close the \\'Autofill\\' menu, potentially returning to the previous context menu or closing the context menu altogether, allowing further steps to delete the text \\'my_note\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon (visually estimated at [372,160]) in the \\'Autofill\\' context menu was successful in that the \\'Autofill\\' context menu disappeared from the screen. However, the text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) was not deleted, and the field remains focused with this text. A toast message \"Contents can\\'t be autofilled\" appeared at the bottom of the screen. This action did not directly bring the agent closer to deleting the text, but it cleared the context menu, allowing for other interactions with the text field. The next step is to attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' for deletion.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[372,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Double tap on the text \\'my_note\\' (at coordinates [372, 153]) in the \\'Name\\' field. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted in a subsequent step. This is a double tap, so it will be executed as two taps in quick succession. The first tap is described here. Actual Outcome: The last action was a tap on the text \\'my_note\\' at coordinates [372, 153]. This was intended as the first of two taps to perform a double tap to select the text. The action did not visibly select the text \\'my_note\\'. The text field remains focused with \\'my_note\\' in it. The toast message \\'Contents can\\'t be autofilled\\' from a prior step is no longer visible. This action, being only the first part of an intended double tap, has not yet achieved text selection, but it is a step in the planned sequence. The double tap is not yet complete.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[372,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the second tap of the double tap on the text \\'my_note\\' (at coordinates [372, 153]) in the \\'Name\\' field. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted in a subsequent step. Actual Outcome: The last action, the second tap of a double tap on \\'my_note\\' at [372, 153], failed to select the text. The text \\'my_note\\' remains in the \\'Name\\' field, and it is not highlighted or otherwise marked as selected. The screen appearance did not change. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the text still needs to be cleared before entering the desired folder name.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 14: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Attempt to delete all text (\\'my_note\\') from the currently focused \\'Name\\' field. The \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) is focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to clear the text field, allowing the desired folder name to be entered. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main interface is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

In the dialog that appears, input the folder name in the \\'Name\\' field, then tap the \\'FOLDER\\' button.\",\"Status\":\"A complete piece of information.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

In the dialog that appears, input the folder name in the \\'Name\\' field, then tap the \\'FOLDER\\' button.\",\"Status\":\"A complete piece of information.\"}]}\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[405,210],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot icon in the context menu. The context menu currently shows \\'Paste\\' and the three-dot icon. The three-dot icon is located to the right of \\'Paste\\'. Tapping this icon is expected to reveal more options for text manipulation, such as \\'Select All\\', \\'Cut\\', or \\'Delete\\'. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping the three-dot icon ([405, 210]) in the context menu, was successful in interacting with the UI. It changed the context menu from displaying [\\'Paste\\', \\'...\\'] to displaying [\\'Autofill\\', back_arrow_icon]. However, this outcome did not directly bring the agent closer to deleting the text \\'my_note\\', as the new menu options are not for deletion. The \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) remains focused and still contains \\'my_note\\'. Further actions are needed to clear this field.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[372,160],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon in the \\'Autofill\\' context menu. The context menu currently shows \\'Autofill\\' and a back arrow. The back arrow is located to the left of \\'Autofill\\', visually estimated at `[372, 160]`. This action is expected to close the \\'Autofill\\' menu, potentially returning to the previous context menu or closing the context menu altogether, allowing further steps to delete the text \\'my_note\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon (visually estimated at [372,160]) in the \\'Autofill\\' context menu was successful in that the \\'Autofill\\' context menu disappeared from the screen. However, the text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) was not deleted, and the field remains focused with this text. A toast message \"Contents can\\'t be autofilled\" appeared at the bottom of the screen. This action did not directly bring the agent closer to deleting the text, but it cleared the context menu, allowing for other interactions with the text field. The next step is to attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' for deletion.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[372,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Double tap on the text \\'my_note\\' (at coordinates [372, 153]) in the \\'Name\\' field. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted in a subsequent step. This is a double tap, so it will be executed as two taps in quick succession. The first tap is described here. Actual Outcome: The last action was a tap on the text \\'my_note\\' at coordinates [372, 153]. This was intended as the first of two taps to perform a double tap to select the text. The action did not visibly select the text \\'my_note\\'. The text field remains focused with \\'my_note\\' in it. The toast message \\'Contents can\\'t be autofilled\\' from a prior step is no longer visible. This action, being only the first part of an intended double tap, has not yet achieved text selection, but it is a step in the planned sequence. The double tap is not yet complete.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[372,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the second tap of the double tap on the text \\'my_note\\' (at coordinates [372, 153]) in the \\'Name\\' field. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted in a subsequent step. Actual Outcome: The last action, the second tap of a double tap on \\'my_note\\' at [372, 153], failed to select the text. The text \\'my_note\\' remains in the \\'Name\\' field, and it is not highlighted or otherwise marked as selected. The screen appearance did not change. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the text still needs to be cleared before entering the desired folder name.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Attempt to delete all text (\\'my_note\\') from the currently focused \\'Name\\' field. The \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) is focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to clear the text field, allowing the desired folder name to be entered. Actual Outcome: The `DELETE_TEXT` action, which was intended to delete all text from the focused \\'Name\\' field, failed. The text \\'my_note\\' is still present in the \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`). The screen appearance did not change as a result of the action. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the text field still needs to be cleared before the desired folder name can be entered.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[405,210],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot icon in the context menu. The context menu currently shows \\'Paste\\' and the three-dot icon. The three-dot icon is located to the right of \\'Paste\\'. Tapping this icon is expected to reveal more options for text manipulation, such as \\'Select All\\', \\'Cut\\', or \\'Delete\\'. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping the three-dot icon ([405, 210]) in the context menu, was successful in interacting with the UI. It changed the context menu from displaying [\\'Paste\\', \\'...\\'] to displaying [\\'Autofill\\', back_arrow_icon]. However, this outcome did not directly bring the agent closer to deleting the text \\'my_note\\', as the new menu options are not for deletion. The \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) remains focused and still contains \\'my_note\\'. Further actions are needed to clear this field.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[372,160],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon in the \\'Autofill\\' context menu. The context menu currently shows \\'Autofill\\' and a back arrow. The back arrow is located to the left of \\'Autofill\\', visually estimated at `[372, 160]`. This action is expected to close the \\'Autofill\\' menu, potentially returning to the previous context menu or closing the context menu altogether, allowing further steps to delete the text \\'my_note\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon (visually estimated at [372,160]) in the \\'Autofill\\' context menu was successful in that the \\'Autofill\\' context menu disappeared from the screen. However, the text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) was not deleted, and the field remains focused with this text. A toast message \"Contents can\\'t be autofilled\" appeared at the bottom of the screen. This action did not directly bring the agent closer to deleting the text, but it cleared the context menu, allowing for other interactions with the text field. The next step is to attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' for deletion.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[372,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Double tap on the text \\'my_note\\' (at coordinates [372, 153]) in the \\'Name\\' field. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted in a subsequent step. This is a double tap, so it will be executed as two taps in quick succession. The first tap is described here. Actual Outcome: The last action was a tap on the text \\'my_note\\' at coordinates [372, 153]. This was intended as the first of two taps to perform a double tap to select the text. The action did not visibly select the text \\'my_note\\'. The text field remains focused with \\'my_note\\' in it. The toast message \\'Contents can\\'t be autofilled\\' from a prior step is no longer visible. This action, being only the first part of an intended double tap, has not yet achieved text selection, but it is a step in the planned sequence. The double tap is not yet complete.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[372,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the second tap of the double tap on the text \\'my_note\\' (at coordinates [372, 153]) in the \\'Name\\' field. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted in a subsequent step. Actual Outcome: The last action, the second tap of a double tap on \\'my_note\\' at [372, 153], failed to select the text. The text \\'my_note\\' remains in the \\'Name\\' field, and it is not highlighted or otherwise marked as selected. The screen appearance did not change. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the text still needs to be cleared before entering the desired folder name.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Attempt to delete all text (\\'my_note\\') from the currently focused \\'Name\\' field. The \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) is focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to clear the text field, allowing the desired folder name to be entered. Actual Outcome: The `DELETE_TEXT` action, which was intended to delete all text from the focused \\'Name\\' field, failed. The text \\'my_note\\' is still present in the \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`). The screen appearance did not change as a result of the action. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the text field still needs to be cleared before the desired folder name can be entered.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 15: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a `KEYCODE_DEL` key event. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to delete the last character \\'e\\' from \\'my_note\\', resulting in \\'my_not\\'.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to close the \\'Autofill\\' menu, potentially returning to the previous context menu or closing the context menu altogether, allowing further steps to delete the text \\'my_note\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon (visually estimated at [372,160]) in the \\'Autofill\\' context menu was successful in that the \\'Autofill\\' context menu disappeared from the screen. However, the text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) was not deleted, and the field remains focused with this text.

The \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) is focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to clear the text field, allowing the desired folder name to be entered. Actual Outcome: The `DELETE_TEXT` action, which was intended to delete all text from the focused \\'Name\\' field, failed. The text \\'my_note\\' is still present in the \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`). The screen appearance did not change as a result of the action.

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[372,160],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon in the \\'Autofill\\' context menu. The context menu currently shows \\'Autofill\\' and a back arrow. The back arrow is located to the left of \\'Autofill\\', visually estimated at `[372, 160]`. This action is expected to close the \\'Autofill\\' menu, potentially returning to the previous context menu or closing the context menu altogether, allowing further steps to delete the text \\'my_note\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon (visually estimated at [372,160]) in the \\'Autofill\\' context menu was successful in that the \\'Autofill\\' context menu disappeared from the screen. However, the text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) was not deleted, and the field remains focused with this text. A toast message \"Contents can\\'t be autofilled\" appeared at the bottom of the screen. This action did not directly bring the agent closer to deleting the text, but it cleared the context menu, allowing for other interactions with the text field. The next step is to attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' for deletion.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[372,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Double tap on the text \\'my_note\\' (at coordinates [372, 153]) in the \\'Name\\' field. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted in a subsequent step. This is a double tap, so it will be executed as two taps in quick succession. The first tap is described here. Actual Outcome: The last action was a tap on the text \\'my_note\\' at coordinates [372, 153]. This was intended as the first of two taps to perform a double tap to select the text. The action did not visibly select the text \\'my_note\\'. The text field remains focused with \\'my_note\\' in it. The toast message \\'Contents can\\'t be autofilled\\' from a prior step is no longer visible. This action, being only the first part of an intended double tap, has not yet achieved text selection, but it is a step in the planned sequence. The double tap is not yet complete.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[372,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the second tap of the double tap on the text \\'my_note\\' (at coordinates [372, 153]) in the \\'Name\\' field. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted in a subsequent step. Actual Outcome: The last action, the second tap of a double tap on \\'my_note\\' at [372, 153], failed to select the text. The text \\'my_note\\' remains in the \\'Name\\' field, and it is not highlighted or otherwise marked as selected. The screen appearance did not change. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the text still needs to be cleared before entering the desired folder name.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Attempt to delete all text (\\'my_note\\') from the currently focused \\'Name\\' field. The \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) is focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to clear the text field, allowing the desired folder name to be entered. Actual Outcome: The `DELETE_TEXT` action, which was intended to delete all text from the focused \\'Name\\' field, failed. The text \\'my_note\\' is still present in the \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`). The screen appearance did not change as a result of the action. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the text field still needs to be cleared before the desired folder name can be entered.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a `KEYCODE_DEL` key event. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to delete the last character \\'e\\' from \\'my_note\\', resulting in \\'my_not\\'. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_DEL` action was performed. However, the text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) remains unchanged. The action did not delete any character from the text field. Therefore, this action failed to bring the agent closer to clearing the text field and completing the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 16: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_FORWARD_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a `KEYCODE_FORWARD_DEL` key event. The \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is an attempt to delete a character from the text field, potentially the first character \\'m\\' if the cursor is at the beginning, or the character after the cursor if it\\'s not at the end. The expected outcome is that at least one character is deleted from \\'my_note\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main interface is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted in a subsequent step. This is a double tap, so it will be executed as two taps in quick succession. The first tap is described here. Actual Outcome: The last action was a tap on the text \\'my_note\\' at coordinates [372, 153]. This was intended as the first of two taps to perform a double tap to select the text. The action did not visibly select the text \\'my_note\\'. The text field remains focused with \\'my_note\\' in it. The toast message \\'Contents can\\'t be autofilled\\' from a prior step is no longer visible. This action, being only the first part of an intended double tap, has not yet achieved text selection, but it is a step in the planned sequence. The double tap is not yet complete.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[372,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the second tap of the double tap on the text \\'my_note\\' (at coordinates [372, 153]) in the \\'Name\\' field. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted in a subsequent step. Actual Outcome: The last action, the second tap of a double tap on \\'my_note\\' at [372, 153], failed to select the text. The text \\'my_note\\' remains in the \\'Name\\' field, and it is not highlighted or otherwise marked as selected. The screen appearance did not change. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the text still needs to be cleared before entering the desired folder name.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Attempt to delete all text (\\'my_note\\') from the currently focused \\'Name\\' field. The \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) is focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to clear the text field, allowing the desired folder name to be entered. Actual Outcome: The `DELETE_TEXT` action, which was intended to delete all text from the focused \\'Name\\' field, failed. The text \\'my_note\\' is still present in the \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`). The screen appearance did not change as a result of the action. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the text field still needs to be cleared before the desired folder name can be entered.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a `KEYCODE_DEL` key event. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to delete the last character \\'e\\' from \\'my_note\\', resulting in \\'my_not\\'. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_DEL` action was performed. However, the text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) remains unchanged. The action did not delete any character from the text field. Therefore, this action failed to bring the agent closer to clearing the text field and completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_FORWARD_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a `KEYCODE_FORWARD_DEL` key event. The \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is an attempt to delete a character from the text field, potentially the first character \\'m\\' if the cursor is at the beginning, or the character after the cursor if it\\'s not at the end. The expected outcome is that at least one character is deleted from \\'my_note\\'. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_FORWARD_DEL` action was performed. However, the text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) remains unchanged. The action did not delete any character from the text field. Therefore, this action failed to bring the agent closer to clearing the text field and completing the active subgoal. The screen appearance did not change.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nCreate a new folder in Markor named folder_20250514_085404.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[372,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Double tap on the text \\'my_note\\' (at coordinates [372, 153]) in the \\'Name\\' field. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted in a subsequent step. This is a double tap, so it will be executed as two taps in quick succession. The first tap is described here. Actual Outcome: The last action was a tap on the text \\'my_note\\' at coordinates [372, 153]. This was intended as the first of two taps to perform a double tap to select the text. The action did not visibly select the text \\'my_note\\'. The text field remains focused with \\'my_note\\' in it. The toast message \\'Contents can\\'t be autofilled\\' from a prior step is no longer visible. This action, being only the first part of an intended double tap, has not yet achieved text selection, but it is a step in the planned sequence. The double tap is not yet complete.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[372,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the second tap of the double tap on the text \\'my_note\\' (at coordinates [372, 153]) in the \\'Name\\' field. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted in a subsequent step. Actual Outcome: The last action, the second tap of a double tap on \\'my_note\\' at [372, 153], failed to select the text. The text \\'my_note\\' remains in the \\'Name\\' field, and it is not highlighted or otherwise marked as selected. The screen appearance did not change. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the text still needs to be cleared before entering the desired folder name.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Attempt to delete all text (\\'my_note\\') from the currently focused \\'Name\\' field. The \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) is focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to clear the text field, allowing the desired folder name to be entered. Actual Outcome: The `DELETE_TEXT` action, which was intended to delete all text from the focused \\'Name\\' field, failed. The text \\'my_note\\' is still present in the \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`). The screen appearance did not change as a result of the action. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the text field still needs to be cleared before the desired folder name can be entered.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a `KEYCODE_DEL` key event. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to delete the last character \\'e\\' from \\'my_note\\', resulting in \\'my_not\\'. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_DEL` action was performed. However, the text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) remains unchanged. The action did not delete any character from the text field. Therefore, this action failed to bring the agent closer to clearing the text field and completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_FORWARD_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a `KEYCODE_FORWARD_DEL` key event. The \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is an attempt to delete a character from the text field, potentially the first character \\'m\\' if the cursor is at the beginning, or the character after the cursor if it\\'s not at the end. The expected outcome is that at least one character is deleted from \\'my_note\\'. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_FORWARD_DEL` action was performed. However, the text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) remains unchanged. The action did not delete any character from the text field. Therefore, this action failed to bring the agent closer to clearing the text field and completing the active subgoal. The screen appearance did not change.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 17: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[375,350],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the text \\'my_note\\' (estimated center at [375, 350]) in the \\'Name\\' field. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is an attempt to bring up a context menu that might include a \\'Select All\\' option, which would allow deleting the current text. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Markor app is open and its main interface is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

In the dialog that appears, input the folder name in the \\'Name\\' field, then tap the \\'FOLDER\\' button.\",\"Status\":\"A complete piece of information.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[372,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the second tap of the double tap on the text \\'my_note\\' (at coordinates [372, 153]) in the \\'Name\\' field. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted in a subsequent step. Actual Outcome: The last action, the second tap of a double tap on \\'my_note\\' at [372, 153], failed to select the text. The text \\'my_note\\' remains in the \\'Name\\' field, and it is not highlighted or otherwise marked as selected. The screen appearance did not change. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the text still needs to be cleared before entering the desired folder name.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Attempt to delete all text (\\'my_note\\') from the currently focused \\'Name\\' field. The \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) is focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to clear the text field, allowing the desired folder name to be entered. Actual Outcome: The `DELETE_TEXT` action, which was intended to delete all text from the focused \\'Name\\' field, failed. The text \\'my_note\\' is still present in the \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`). The screen appearance did not change as a result of the action. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the text field still needs to be cleared before the desired folder name can be entered.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a `KEYCODE_DEL` key event. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to delete the last character \\'e\\' from \\'my_note\\', resulting in \\'my_not\\'. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_DEL` action was performed. However, the text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) remains unchanged. The action did not delete any character from the text field. Therefore, this action failed to bring the agent closer to clearing the text field and completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_FORWARD_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a `KEYCODE_FORWARD_DEL` key event. The \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is an attempt to delete a character from the text field, potentially the first character \\'m\\' if the cursor is at the beginning, or the character after the cursor if it\\'s not at the end. The expected outcome is that at least one character is deleted from \\'my_note\\'. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_FORWARD_DEL` action was performed. However, the text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) remains unchanged. The action did not delete any character from the text field. Therefore, this action failed to bring the agent closer to clearing the text field and completing the active subgoal. The screen appearance did not change.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[375,350],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the text \\'my_note\\' (estimated center at [375, 350]) in the \\'Name\\' field. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is an attempt to bring up a context menu that might include a \\'Select All\\' option, which would allow deleting the current text. Actual Outcome: The long press action on the text \\'my_note\\' (at coordinates [375, 350]) in the \\'Name\\' field resulted in a \"Paste\" option appearing above the text field. This indicates that a context menu for text operations has been activated. It is highly probable that the text \\'my_note\\' is now selected as a result of the long press. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal of creating the folder, as the text is now potentially selected and ready for deletion.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[372,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the second tap of the double tap on the text \\'my_note\\' (at coordinates [372, 153]) in the \\'Name\\' field. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted in a subsequent step. Actual Outcome: The last action, the second tap of a double tap on \\'my_note\\' at [372, 153], failed to select the text. The text \\'my_note\\' remains in the \\'Name\\' field, and it is not highlighted or otherwise marked as selected. The screen appearance did not change. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the text still needs to be cleared before entering the desired folder name.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field.

The \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) is focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to clear the text field, allowing the desired folder name to be entered. Actual Outcome: The `DELETE_TEXT` action, which was intended to delete all text from the focused \\'Name\\' field, failed. The text \\'my_note\\' is still present in the \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`). The screen appearance did not change as a result of the action.

The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is expected to delete the last character \\'e\\' from \\'my_note\\', resulting in \\'my_not\\'. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_DEL` action was performed. However, the text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) remains unchanged. The action did not delete any character from the text field. Therefore, this action failed to bring the agent closer to clearing the text field and completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_FORWARD_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a `KEYCODE_FORWARD_DEL` key event. The \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is an attempt to delete a character from the text field, potentially the first character \\'m\\' if the cursor is at the beginning, or the character after the cursor if it\\'s not at the end. The expected outcome is that at least one character is deleted from \\'my_note\\'. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_FORWARD_DEL` action was performed. However, the text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) remains unchanged. The action did not delete any character from the text field. Therefore, this action failed to bring the agent closer to clearing the text field and completing the active subgoal. The screen appearance did not change.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[375,350],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the text \\'my_note\\' (estimated center at [375, 350]) in the \\'Name\\' field. The \\'Name\\' field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is an attempt to bring up a context menu that might include a \\'Select All\\' option, which would allow deleting the current text. Actual Outcome: The long press action on the text \\'my_note\\' (at coordinates [375, 350]) in the \\'Name\\' field resulted in a \"Paste\" option appearing above the text field. This indicates that a context menu for text operations has been activated. It is highly probable that the text \\'my_note\\' is now selected as a result of the long press. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal of creating the folder, as the text is now potentially selected and ready for deletion.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 18: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a `KEYCODE_DEL` key event.

In the dialog that appears, input the folder name in the \\'Name\\' field, then tap the \\'FOLDER\\' button.\",\"Status\":\"A complete piece of information.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",
