Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [54, 712, 65, 797], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [123, 46, 147, 306], \\'text\\': \\'Sun; Oct 15\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 336, 722, 431], \\'text\\': \\'Gmail\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 561, 722, 676], \\'text\\': \\'Photos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [704, 781, 722, 921], \\'text\\': \\'YouTube\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [775, 295, 872, 709], \\'text\\': \\'0 (9\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 72, 855, 232]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [788, 765, 856, 928]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [628, 537, 729, 694]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 535, 858, 706]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 299, 856, 466]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 765, 729, 927]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [628, 301, 730, 463]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [900, 701, 948, 795]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [892, 801, 952, 925]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 823, 39, 899]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is taken because the Markor app is not visible on the home screen and needs to be found in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, revealing a grid of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Markor app.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, revealing a grid of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Markor app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[868,614],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Markor\\' app icon, which is currently visible in the app drawer. The icon is located at approximately `[868, 614]`. This action is expected to open the Markor application. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Markor\\' app icon (located around `[868, 614]` in the previous screen) was successful. The Markor application opened, and its main screen, which is a file browser, is now visible. This directly led to the completion of the active subgoal (\\'Open Markor App\\') and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is taken because the Markor app is not visible on the home screen and needs to be found in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, revealing a grid of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Markor app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[868,614],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Markor\\' app icon, which is currently visible in the app drawer. The icon is located at approximately `[868, 614]`. This action is expected to open the Markor application. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Markor\\' app icon (located around `[868, 614]` in the previous screen) was successful. The Markor application opened, and its main screen, which is a file browser, is now visible. This directly led to the completion of the active subgoal (\\'Open Markor App\\') and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 2: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is taken because the Markor app is not visible on the home screen and needs to be found in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, revealing a grid of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Markor app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[868,614],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Markor\\' app icon, which is currently visible in the app drawer. The icon is located at approximately `[868, 614]`. This action is expected to open the Markor application. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Markor\\' app icon (located around `[868, 614]` in the previous screen) was successful. The Markor application opened, and its main screen, which is a file browser, is now visible. This directly led to the completion of the active subgoal (\\'Open Markor App\\') and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[200,416],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'2023_08_10_neat_wolf.txt\\' to open it. The file is listed on the screen. This action is expected to open the note for viewing or editing. Actual Outcome: The action was a tap on the file \\'2023_08_10_neat_wolf.txt\\' at coordinates [200, 416]. This action failed to open the file, as evidenced by the screen remaining unchanged. Therefore, the agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal. To rectify this, the next action will be to try tapping the file again. If this second attempt also fails, alternative methods such as long-pressing the file or exploring menu options will be considered.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is taken because the Markor app is not visible on the home screen and needs to be found in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, revealing a grid of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Markor app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[868,614],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Markor\\' app icon, which is currently visible in the app drawer. The icon is located at approximately `[868, 614]`. This action is expected to open the Markor application. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Markor\\' app icon (located around `[868, 614]` in the previous screen) was successful. The Markor application opened, and its main screen, which is a file browser, is now visible. This directly led to the completion of the active subgoal (\\'Open Markor App\\') and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[200,416],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'2023_08_10_neat_wolf.txt\\' to open it. The file is listed on the screen. This action is expected to open the note for viewing or editing. Actual Outcome: The action was a tap on the file \\'2023_08_10_neat_wolf.txt\\' at coordinates [200, 416]. This action failed to open the file, as evidenced by the screen remaining unchanged. Therefore, the agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal. To rectify this, the next action will be to try tapping the file again. If this second attempt also fails, alternative methods such as long-pressing the file or exploring menu options will be considered.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 3: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[200,416],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'2023_08_10_neat_wolf.txt\\' again to attempt to open it. The file is listed on the screen. This action is expected to open the note for viewing or editing.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is taken because the Markor app is not visible on the home screen and needs to be found in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, revealing a grid of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Markor app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[868,614],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Markor\\' app icon, which is currently visible in the app drawer. The icon is located at approximately `[868, 614]`. This action is expected to open the Markor application. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Markor\\' app icon (located around `[868, 614]` in the previous screen) was successful. The Markor application opened, and its main screen, which is a file browser, is now visible. This directly led to the completion of the active subgoal (\\'Open Markor App\\') and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[200,416],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'2023_08_10_neat_wolf.txt\\' to open it. The file is listed on the screen. This action is expected to open the note for viewing or editing. Actual Outcome: The action was a tap on the file \\'2023_08_10_neat_wolf.txt\\' at coordinates [200, 416]. This action failed to open the file, as evidenced by the screen remaining unchanged. Therefore, the agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal. To rectify this, the next action will be to try tapping the file again. If this second attempt also fails, alternative methods such as long-pressing the file or exploring menu options will be considered.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[200,416],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'2023_08_10_neat_wolf.txt\\' again to attempt to open it. The file is listed on the screen. This action is expected to open the note for viewing or editing. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on the file \\'2023_08_10_neat_wolf.txt\\', was successful. The note opened, and its content \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' is now visible on the screen. This completes the active subgoal and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.37\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [73, 34, 100, 423], \\'text\\': \\'2023_08_10_ne.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [135, 36, 155, 762], \\'text\\': \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [938, 150, 962, 332], \\'text\\': \\'= ,\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 833, 973, 933]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 951, 972, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [931, 603, 967, 692]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [930, 718, 969, 814]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [930, 484, 971, 576]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 822, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [928, 242, 974, 344]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 366, 974, 457]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 911, 99, 983]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 814, 101, 895]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 141, 36, 188]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [928, 128, 973, 228]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 196, 37, 239]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [985, 362, 1000, 634]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 906, 36, 942]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [932, 15, 969, 101]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 520, 101, 605]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is taken because the Markor app is not visible on the home screen and needs to be found in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, revealing a grid of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Markor app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[868,614],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Markor\\' app icon, which is currently visible in the app drawer. The icon is located at approximately `[868, 614]`. This action is expected to open the Markor application. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Markor\\' app icon (located around `[868, 614]` in the previous screen) was successful. The Markor application opened, and its main screen, which is a file browser, is now visible. This directly led to the completion of the active subgoal (\\'Open Markor App\\') and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[200,416],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'2023_08_10_neat_wolf.txt\\' to open it. The file is listed on the screen. This action is expected to open the note for viewing or editing. Actual Outcome: The action was a tap on the file \\'2023_08_10_neat_wolf.txt\\' at coordinates [200, 416]. This action failed to open the file, as evidenced by the screen remaining unchanged. Therefore, the agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal. To rectify this, the next action will be to try tapping the file again. If this second attempt also fails, alternative methods such as long-pressing the file or exploring menu options will be considered.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[200,416],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'2023_08_10_neat_wolf.txt\\' again to attempt to open it. The file is listed on the screen. This action is expected to open the note for viewing or editing. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on the file \\'2023_08_10_neat_wolf.txt\\', was successful. The note opened, and its content \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' is now visible on the screen. This completes the active subgoal and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 4: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[145,46],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap at the beginning of the existing text \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' (coordinates `[145, 46]`) to move the cursor to the start of the line. This is a prerequisite for prepending the new text.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is taken because the Markor app is not visible on the home screen and needs to be found in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, revealing a grid of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Markor app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[868,614],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Markor\\' app icon, which is currently visible in the app drawer. The icon is located at approximately `[868, 614]`. This action is expected to open the Markor application. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Markor\\' app icon (located around `[868, 614]` in the previous screen) was successful. The Markor application opened, and its main screen, which is a file browser, is now visible. This directly led to the completion of the active subgoal (\\'Open Markor App\\') and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[200,416],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'2023_08_10_neat_wolf.txt\\' to open it. The file is listed on the screen. This action is expected to open the note for viewing or editing. Actual Outcome: The action was a tap on the file \\'2023_08_10_neat_wolf.txt\\' at coordinates [200, 416]. This action failed to open the file, as evidenced by the screen remaining unchanged. Therefore, the agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal. To rectify this, the next action will be to try tapping the file again. If this second attempt also fails, alternative methods such as long-pressing the file or exploring menu options will be considered.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[200,416],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'2023_08_10_neat_wolf.txt\\' again to attempt to open it. The file is listed on the screen. This action is expected to open the note for viewing or editing. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on the file \\'2023_08_10_neat_wolf.txt\\', was successful. The note opened, and its content \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' is now visible on the screen. This completes the active subgoal and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[145,46],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap at the beginning of the existing text \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' (coordinates `[145, 46]`) to move the cursor to the start of the line. This is a prerequisite for prepending the new text. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping at `[145, 46]` successfully focused the text field, as indicated by the \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' overlay appearing. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the text field for input at the correct position.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.37\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [73, 34, 100, 423], \\'text\\': \\'2023_08_10_ne.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [133, 36, 155, 762], \\'text\\': \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [890, 143, 915, 336], \\'text\\': \\'= ,\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 653], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 822, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 910, 100, 983]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 835, 928, 930]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 905, 36, 942]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 141, 36, 188]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 813, 102, 895]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 240, 929, 343]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 596, 936, 699]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 196, 37, 239]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 951, 925, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 127, 927, 227]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 486, 937, 575]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 362, 938, 461]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [883, 14, 923, 101]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 722, 926, 812]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 521, 101, 605]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 715, 100, 797]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 620, 100, 699]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"0\", text=\"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\n\", resource-id=\"net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"net.gsantner.markor\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[0,275][1080,2102]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\n\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is taken because the Markor app is not visible on the home screen and needs to be found in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, revealing a grid of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Markor app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[868,614],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Markor\\' app icon, which is currently visible in the app drawer. The icon is located at approximately `[868, 614]`. This action is expected to open the Markor application. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Markor\\' app icon (located around `[868, 614]` in the previous screen) was successful. The Markor application opened, and its main screen, which is a file browser, is now visible. This directly led to the completion of the active subgoal (\\'Open Markor App\\') and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[200,416],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'2023_08_10_neat_wolf.txt\\' to open it. The file is listed on the screen. This action is expected to open the note for viewing or editing. Actual Outcome: The action was a tap on the file \\'2023_08_10_neat_wolf.txt\\' at coordinates [200, 416]. This action failed to open the file, as evidenced by the screen remaining unchanged. Therefore, the agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal. To rectify this, the next action will be to try tapping the file again. If this second attempt also fails, alternative methods such as long-pressing the file or exploring menu options will be considered.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[200,416],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'2023_08_10_neat_wolf.txt\\' again to attempt to open it. The file is listed on the screen. This action is expected to open the note for viewing or editing. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on the file \\'2023_08_10_neat_wolf.txt\\', was successful. The note opened, and its content \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' is now visible on the screen. This completes the active subgoal and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[145,46],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap at the beginning of the existing text \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' (coordinates `[145, 46]`) to move the cursor to the start of the line. This is a prerequisite for prepending the new text. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping at `[145, 46]` successfully focused the text field, as indicated by the \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' overlay appearing. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the text field for input at the correct position.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 5: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' into the focused text field. The text field currently contains \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' and the cursor is at the beginning. This action will insert the new text before the existing content. The predicted outcome is that the text field will now contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplRWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\'.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[868,614],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Markor\\' app icon, which is currently visible in the app drawer. The icon is located at approximately `[868, 614]`. This action is expected to open the Markor application. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Markor\\' app icon (located around `[868, 614]` in the previous screen) was successful. The Markor application opened, and its main screen, which is a file browser, is now visible. This directly led to the completion of the active subgoal (\\'Open Markor App\\') and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[200,416],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'2023_08_10_neat_wolf.txt\\' to open it. The file is listed on the screen. This action is expected to open the note for viewing or editing. Actual Outcome: The action was a tap on the file \\'2023_08_10_neat_wolf.txt\\' at coordinates [200, 416]. This action failed to open the file, as evidenced by the screen remaining unchanged. Therefore, the agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal. To rectify this, the next action will be to try tapping the file again. If this second attempt also fails, alternative methods such as long-pressing the file or exploring menu options will be considered.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[200,416],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'2023_08_10_neat_wolf.txt\\' again to attempt to open it. The file is listed on the screen. This action is expected to open the note for viewing or editing. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on the file \\'2023_08_10_neat_wolf.txt\\', was successful. The note opened, and its content \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' is now visible on the screen. This completes the active subgoal and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[145,46],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap at the beginning of the existing text \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' (coordinates `[145, 46]`) to move the cursor to the start of the line. This is a prerequisite for prepending the new text. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping at `[145, 46]` successfully focused the text field, as indicated by the \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' overlay appearing. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the text field for input at the correct position.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' into the focused text field. The text field currently contains \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' and the cursor is at the beginning. This action will insert the new text before the existing content. The predicted outcome is that the text field will now contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplRWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' resulted in the text being appended to the existing content, rather than prepended as intended. The text field now displays \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. This outcome does not align with the subgoal\\'s objective of prepending the text. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. Corrective steps are needed: delete the appended text, ensure the cursor is at the very beginning, re-input the text, and then add a newline.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\n\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[868,614],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Markor\\' app icon, which is currently visible in the app drawer. The icon is located at approximately `[868, 614]`. This action is expected to open the Markor application. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Markor\\' app icon (located around `[868, 614]` in the previous screen) was successful. The Markor application opened, and its main screen, which is a file browser, is now visible. This directly led to the completion of the active subgoal (\\'Open Markor App\\') and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[200,416],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'2023_08_10_neat_wolf.txt\\' to open it. The file is listed on the screen. This action is expected to open the note for viewing or editing. Actual Outcome: The action was a tap on the file \\'2023_08_10_neat_wolf.txt\\' at coordinates [200, 416]. This action failed to open the file, as evidenced by the screen remaining unchanged. Therefore, the agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal. To rectify this, the next action will be to try tapping the file again. If this second attempt also fails, alternative methods such as long-pressing the file or exploring menu options will be considered.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[200,416],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'2023_08_10_neat_wolf.txt\\' again to attempt to open it. The file is listed on the screen. This action is expected to open the note for viewing or editing. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on the file \\'2023_08_10_neat_wolf.txt\\', was successful. The note opened, and its content \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' is now visible on the screen. This completes the active subgoal and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The file is listed on the screen. This action is expected to open the note for viewing or editing. Actual Outcome: The action was a tap on the file \\'2023_08_10_neat_wolf.txt\\' at coordinates [200, 416]. This action failed to open the file, as evidenced by the screen remaining unchanged. Therefore, the agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal. To rectify this, the next action will be to try tapping the file again. If this second attempt also fails, alternative methods such as long-pressing the file or exploring menu options will be considered.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[200,416],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'2023_08_10_neat_wolf.txt\\' again to attempt to open it. The file is listed on the screen. This action is expected to open the note for viewing or editing. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on the file \\'2023_08_10_neat_wolf.txt\\', was successful. The note opened, and its content \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' is now visible on the screen. This completes the active subgoal and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[145,46],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap at the beginning of the existing text \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' (coordinates `[145, 46]`) to move the cursor to the start of the line. This is a prerequisite for prepending the new text. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping at `[145, 46]` successfully focused the text field, as indicated by the \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' overlay appearing. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the text field for input at the correct position.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' into the focused text field. The text field currently contains \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' and the cursor is at the beginning. This action will insert the new text before the existing content. The predicted outcome is that the text field will now contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplRWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' resulted in the text being appended to the existing content, rather than prepended as intended. The text field now displays \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. This outcome does not align with the subgoal\\'s objective of prepending the text. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. Corrective steps are needed: delete the appended text, ensure the cursor is at the very beginning, re-input the text, and then add a newline.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\' currently contains \"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\". This action is predicted to clear the text field, making it empty, which is the first step in correcting the previously mis-entered text. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' was successful. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\', which previously contained \"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\", is now empty. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by clearing the incorrect text, allowing for a fresh attempt to prepend the required text.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"\\n\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 42, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.40\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 66, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [73, 34, 100, 423], \\'text\\': \\'2023_08_10_ne.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 727, 96, 889], \\'text\\': \\'0 Q\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 34, 157, 428], \\'text\\': \\'Rnl8sP34yDzJQbvkfpIR\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [890, 143, 915, 336], \\'text\\': \\'= ,\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 653], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 908, 100, 985]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 835, 926, 931]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 619, 99, 701]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 813, 102, 895]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 521, 97, 605]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 594, 935, 700]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 716, 101, 798]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 243, 928, 344]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 951, 925, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 822, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 483, 939, 577]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 362, 939, 462]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 126, 927, 226]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 719, 926, 814]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 195, 37, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 9, 925, 103]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 905, 36, 944]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 141, 37, 189]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 425, 113, 508]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"0\", text=\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\n\", resource-id=\"net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"net.gsantner.markor\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[0,275][1080,2102]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\n\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nUpdate the Markor note 2023_08_10_neat_wolf.txt by adding the following text, along with a new blank line before the existing content: \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\", and rename it to busy_wolf_2023_07_23.txt.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[200,416],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'2023_08_10_neat_wolf.txt\\' to open it. The file is listed on the screen. This action is expected to open the note for viewing or editing. Actual Outcome: The action was a tap on the file \\'2023_08_10_neat_wolf.txt\\' at coordinates [200, 416]. This action failed to open the file, as evidenced by the screen remaining unchanged. Therefore, the agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal. To rectify this, the next action will be to try tapping the file again. If this second attempt also fails, alternative methods such as long-pressing the file or exploring menu options will be considered.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[200,416],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'2023_08_10_neat_wolf.txt\\' again to attempt to open it. The file is listed on the screen. This action is expected to open the note for viewing or editing. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on the file \\'2023_08_10_neat_wolf.txt\\', was successful. The note opened, and its content \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' is now visible on the screen. This completes the active subgoal and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[145,46],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap at the beginning of the existing text \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' (coordinates `[145, 46]`) to move the cursor to the start of the line. This is a prerequisite for prepending the new text. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping at `[145, 46]` successfully focused the text field, as indicated by the \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' overlay appearing. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the text field for input at the correct position.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' into the focused text field. The text field currently contains \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' and the cursor is at the beginning. This action will insert the new text before the existing content. The predicted outcome is that the text field will now contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplRWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' resulted in the text being appended to the existing content, rather than prepended as intended. The text field now displays \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. This outcome does not align with the subgoal\\'s objective of prepending the text. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. Corrective steps are needed: delete the appended text, ensure the cursor is at the very beginning, re-input the text, and then add a newline.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\' currently contains \"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\". This action is predicted to clear the text field, making it empty, which is the first step in correcting the previously mis-entered text. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' was successful. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\', which previously contained \"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\", is now empty. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by clearing the incorrect text, allowing for a fresh attempt to prepend the required text.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 7: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' into the currently focused and empty text field. This is the first part of prepending the new content to the note. The text field is currently empty. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen is visible. `is_markor_app_installed_and_opened` is set to \\'true\\'.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[200,416],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'2023_08_10_neat_wolf.txt\\' again to attempt to open it. The file is listed on the screen. This action is expected to open the note for viewing or editing. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on the file \\'2023_08_10_neat_wolf.txt\\', was successful. The note opened, and its content \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' is now visible on the screen. This completes the active subgoal and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[145,46],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap at the beginning of the existing text \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' (coordinates `[145, 46]`) to move the cursor to the start of the line. This is a prerequisite for prepending the new text. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping at `[145, 46]` successfully focused the text field, as indicated by the \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' overlay appearing. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the text field for input at the correct position.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' into the focused text field. The text field currently contains \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' and the cursor is at the beginning. This action will insert the new text before the existing content. The predicted outcome is that the text field will now contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplRWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' resulted in the text being appended to the existing content, rather than prepended as intended. The text field now displays \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. This outcome does not align with the subgoal\\'s objective of prepending the text. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. Corrective steps are needed: delete the appended text, ensure the cursor is at the very beginning, re-input the text, and then add a newline.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\' currently contains \"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\". This action is predicted to clear the text field, making it empty, which is the first step in correcting the previously mis-entered text. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' was successful. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\', which previously contained \"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\", is now empty. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by clearing the incorrect text, allowing for a fresh attempt to prepend the required text.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' into the currently focused and empty text field. This is the first part of prepending the new content to the note. The text field is currently empty. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' into the empty text field was successful. The text field now contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\n\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[200,416],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'2023_08_10_neat_wolf.txt\\' again to attempt to open it. The file is listed on the screen. This action is expected to open the note for viewing or editing. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on the file \\'2023_08_10_neat_wolf.txt\\', was successful. The note opened, and its content \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' is now visible on the screen. This completes the active subgoal and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[145,46],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap at the beginning of the existing text \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' (coordinates `[145, 46]`) to move the cursor to the start of the line. This is a prerequisite for prepending the new text. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping at `[145, 46]` successfully focused the text field, as indicated by the \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' overlay appearing. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the text field for input at the correct position.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' into the focused text field. The text field currently contains \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' and the cursor is at the beginning. This action will insert the new text before the existing content. The predicted outcome is that the text field will now contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplRWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' resulted in the text being appended to the existing content, rather than prepended as intended. The text field now displays \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. This outcome does not align with the subgoal\\'s objective of prepending the text. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. Corrective steps are needed: delete the appended text, ensure the cursor is at the very beginning, re-input the text, and then add a newline.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\' currently contains \"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\". This action is predicted to clear the text field, making it empty, which is the first step in correcting the previously mis-entered text. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' was successful. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\', which previously contained \"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\", is now empty. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by clearing the incorrect text, allowing for a fresh attempt to prepend the required text.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' into the currently focused and empty text field. This is the first part of prepending the new content to the note. The text field is currently empty. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' into the empty text field was successful. The text field now contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 8: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send an Enter key event (keycode 66) to add a new line after the currently entered text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. The text field is currently focused and contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. This action is predicted to change the text field content to \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\', with the cursor on the new line.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[145,46],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap at the beginning of the existing text \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' (coordinates `[145, 46]`) to move the cursor to the start of the line. This is a prerequisite for prepending the new text. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping at `[145, 46]` successfully focused the text field, as indicated by the \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' overlay appearing. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the text field for input at the correct position.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' into the focused text field. The text field currently contains \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' and the cursor is at the beginning. This action will insert the new text before the existing content. The predicted outcome is that the text field will now contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplRWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' resulted in the text being appended to the existing content, rather than prepended as intended. The text field now displays \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. This outcome does not align with the subgoal\\'s objective of prepending the text. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. Corrective steps are needed: delete the appended text, ensure the cursor is at the very beginning, re-input the text, and then add a newline.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\' currently contains \"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\". This action is predicted to clear the text field, making it empty, which is the first step in correcting the previously mis-entered text. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' was successful. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\', which previously contained \"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\", is now empty. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by clearing the incorrect text, allowing for a fresh attempt to prepend the required text.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' into the currently focused and empty text field. This is the first part of prepending the new content to the note. The text field is currently empty. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' into the empty text field was successful. The text field now contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send an Enter key event (keycode 66) to add a new line after the currently entered text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. The text field is currently focused and contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. This action is predicted to change the text field content to \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\', with the cursor on the new line. Actual Outcome: The action of sending an Enter key event (keycode 66) was successful. It added an additional newline character to the text field. The text field, which previously contained \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\' (according to XML data), now contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. This prepares the note for the original content to be appended after the new text and a blank line, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 41, 36, 133], \\'text\\': \\'15.41\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 66, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [73, 34, 100, 423], \\'text\\': \\'2023_08_10_ne.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 728, 95, 900], \\'text\\': \\'0 Q\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [135, 36, 155, 424], \\'text\\': \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfpIR\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [890, 143, 915, 336], \\'text\\': \\'= ,\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 653], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 907, 100, 985]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 593, 930, 703]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 833, 927, 933]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 242, 929, 345]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 822, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 521, 98, 606]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 360, 939, 464]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 949, 925, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 813, 102, 895]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 715, 100, 799]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 480, 939, 578]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 619, 99, 701]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 140, 36, 189]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 127, 927, 228]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 37, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 905, 36, 943]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 718, 927, 814]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 14, 923, 103]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 425, 114, 508]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"0\", text=\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\n\\n\", resource-id=\"net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"net.gsantner.markor\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[0,275][1080,2102]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\n\\n\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[145,46],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap at the beginning of the existing text \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' (coordinates `[145, 46]`) to move the cursor to the start of the line. This is a prerequisite for prepending the new text. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping at `[145, 46]` successfully focused the text field, as indicated by the \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' overlay appearing. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the text field for input at the correct position.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' into the focused text field. The text field currently contains \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' and the cursor is at the beginning. This action will insert the new text before the existing content. The predicted outcome is that the text field will now contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplRWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' resulted in the text being appended to the existing content, rather than prepended as intended. The text field now displays \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. This outcome does not align with the subgoal\\'s objective of prepending the text. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. Corrective steps are needed: delete the appended text, ensure the cursor is at the very beginning, re-input the text, and then add a newline.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\' currently contains \"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\". This action is predicted to clear the text field, making it empty, which is the first step in correcting the previously mis-entered text. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' was successful. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\', which previously contained \"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\", is now empty. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by clearing the incorrect text, allowing for a fresh attempt to prepend the required text.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' into the currently focused and empty text field. This is the first part of prepending the new content to the note. The text field is currently empty. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' into the empty text field was successful. The text field now contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send an Enter key event (keycode 66) to add a new line after the currently entered text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. The text field is currently focused and contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. This action is predicted to change the text field content to \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\', with the cursor on the new line. Actual Outcome: The action of sending an Enter key event (keycode 66) was successful. It added an additional newline character to the text field. The text field, which previously contained \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\' (according to XML data), now contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. This prepares the note for the original content to be appended after the new text and a blank line, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 9: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Append the original note content \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' to the currently focused text field. The text field currently contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\'.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text field currently contains \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' and the cursor is at the beginning. This action will insert the new text before the existing content. The predicted outcome is that the text field will now contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplRWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' resulted in the text being appended to the existing content, rather than prepended as intended. The text field now displays \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. This outcome does not align with the subgoal\\'s objective of prepending the text. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. Corrective steps are needed: delete the appended text, ensure the cursor is at the very beginning, re-input the text, and then add a newline.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\' currently contains \"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\". This action is predicted to clear the text field, making it empty, which is the first step in correcting the previously mis-entered text. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' was successful. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\', which previously contained \"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\", is now empty. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by clearing the incorrect text, allowing for a fresh attempt to prepend the required text.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' into the currently focused and empty text field. This is the first part of prepending the new content to the note. The text field is currently empty. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' into the empty text field was successful. The text field now contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send an Enter key event (keycode 66) to add a new line after the currently entered text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. The text field is currently focused and contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. This action is predicted to change the text field content to \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\', with the cursor on the new line. Actual Outcome: The action of sending an Enter key event (keycode 66) was successful. It added an additional newline character to the text field. The text field, which previously contained \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\' (according to XML data), now contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. This prepares the note for the original content to be appended after the new text and a blank line, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Append the original note content \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' to the currently focused text field. The text field currently contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of appending \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' was executed. The text field, which was supposed to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\', now contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\\'. This means the original content was added, but the crucial blank line (an extra newline) between the prepended text and the original content is missing. The action partially moved towards the subgoal by adding the original text, but failed to achieve the correct formatting.

The text you can edit is: \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\n\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.42\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [73, 35, 98, 423], \\'text\\': \\'2023_08_10_ne.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 727, 96, 889], \\'text\\': \\'0 Q\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [890, 143, 915, 336], \\'text\\': \\'= ,\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 653], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 907, 100, 985]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 833, 927, 933]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 594, 935, 700]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 242, 928, 345]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [879, 949, 925, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 822, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 716, 100, 799]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 813, 102, 895]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 481, 938, 578]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 620, 99, 701]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 521, 97, 603]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 362, 937, 463]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 126, 927, 229]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 196, 37, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 717, 927, 815]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 141, 36, 188]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 905, 36, 943]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 7, 926, 105]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 425, 112, 508]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"0\", text=\"\\n\", resource-id=\"net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"net.gsantner.markor\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[0,275][1080,2102]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"\\n\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nUpdate the Markor note 2023_08_10_neat_wolf.txt by adding the following text, along with a new blank line before the existing content: \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\", and rename it to busy_wolf_2023_07_23.txt.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' into the focused text field. The text field currently contains \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' and the cursor is at the beginning. This action will insert the new text before the existing content. The predicted outcome is that the text field will now contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplRWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' resulted in the text being appended to the existing content, rather than prepended as intended. The text field now displays \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. This outcome does not align with the subgoal\\'s objective of prepending the text. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. Corrective steps are needed: delete the appended text, ensure the cursor is at the very beginning, re-input the text, and then add a newline.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\' currently contains \"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\". This action is predicted to clear the text field, making it empty, which is the first step in correcting the previously mis-entered text. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' was successful. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\', which previously contained \"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\", is now empty. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by clearing the incorrect text, allowing for a fresh attempt to prepend the required text.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' into the currently focused and empty text field. This is the first part of prepending the new content to the note. The text field is currently empty. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' into the empty text field was successful. The text field now contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send an Enter key event (keycode 66) to add a new line after the currently entered text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. The text field is currently focused and contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. This action is predicted to change the text field content to \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\', with the cursor on the new line. Actual Outcome: The action of sending an Enter key event (keycode 66) was successful. It added an additional newline character to the text field. The text field, which previously contained \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\' (according to XML data), now contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. This prepares the note for the original content to be appended after the new text and a blank line, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Append the original note content \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' to the currently focused text field. The text field currently contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of appending \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' was executed. The text field, which was supposed to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\', now contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\\'. This means the original content was added, but the crucial blank line (an extra newline) between the prepended text and the original content is missing. The action partially moved towards the subgoal by adding the original text, but failed to achieve the correct formatting. Corrective steps are needed to ensure the blank line is present.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 10: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\' currently contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\". This action is predicted to clear the text field, making it empty, which is the first step in correcting the previously mis-entered text. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen is visible. `is_markor_app_installed_and_opened` is set to \\'true\\'.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\' currently contains \"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\". This action is predicted to clear the text field, making it empty, which is the first step in correcting the previously mis-entered text. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' was successful. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\', which previously contained \"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\", is now empty. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by clearing the incorrect text, allowing for a fresh attempt to prepend the required text.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' into the currently focused and empty text field. This is the first part of prepending the new content to the note. The text field is currently empty. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' into the empty text field was successful. The text field now contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send an Enter key event (keycode 66) to add a new line after the currently entered text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. The text field is currently focused and contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. This action is predicted to change the text field content to \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\', with the cursor on the new line. Actual Outcome: The action of sending an Enter key event (keycode 66) was successful. It added an additional newline character to the text field. The text field, which previously contained \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\' (according to XML data), now contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. This prepares the note for the original content to be appended after the new text and a blank line, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Append the original note content \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' to the currently focused text field.

After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of appending \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' was executed. The text field, which was supposed to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\', now contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\\'. This means the original content was added, but the crucial blank line (an extra newline) between the prepended text and the original content is missing. The action partially moved towards the subgoal by adding the original text, but failed to achieve the correct formatting. Corrective steps are needed to ensure the blank line is present.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field.

This action is predicted to clear the text field, making it empty, which is the first step in correcting the previously mis-entered text. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' was successful. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\', which previously contained \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfpIR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\", is now empty.

As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.42\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [73, 35, 98, 423], \\'text\\': \\'2023_08_10_ne.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 727, 96, 889], \\'text\\': \\'0 Q\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [890, 143, 915, 336], \\'text\\': \\'= ,\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 653], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 907, 100, 985]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 833, 927, 933]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 594, 935, 700]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 242, 928, 345]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [879, 949, 925, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 822, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 716, 100, 799]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 813, 102, 895]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 481, 938, 578]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 620, 99, 701]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 521, 97, 603]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 362, 937, 463]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 126, 927, 229]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 196, 37, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 717, 927, 815]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 141, 36, 188]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 905, 36, 943]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 7, 926, 105]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 425, 112, 508]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"0\", text=\"\\n\", resource-id=\"net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"net.gsantner.markor\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[0,275][1080,2102]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"\\n\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\' currently contains \"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\". This action is predicted to clear the text field, making it empty, which is the first step in correcting the previously mis-entered text. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' was successful. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\', which previously contained \"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\", is now empty. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by clearing the incorrect text, allowing for a fresh attempt to prepend the required text.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' into the currently focused and empty text field. This is the first part of prepending the new content to the note. The text field is currently empty. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' into the empty text field was successful. The text field now contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send an Enter key event (keycode 66) to add a new line after the currently entered text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. The text field is currently focused and contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. This action is predicted to change the text field content to \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\', with the cursor on the new line. Actual Outcome: The action of sending an Enter key event (keycode 66) was successful. It added an additional newline character to the text field. The text field, which previously contained \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\' (according to XML data), now contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. This prepares the note for the original content to be appended after the new text and a blank line, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Append the original note content \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' to the currently focused text field. The text field currently contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of appending \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' was executed. The text field, which was supposed to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\', now contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\\'. This means the original content was added, but the crucial blank line (an extra newline) between the prepended text and the original content is missing. The action partially moved towards the subgoal by adding the original text, but failed to achieve the correct formatting. Corrective steps are needed to ensure the blank line is present.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\' currently contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\". This action is predicted to clear the text field, making it empty, which is the first step in correcting the previously mis-entered text. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' was successful. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\', which previously contained \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfpIR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\", is now empty.

This is the first part of prepending the new content to the note. The text field is currently empty. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is the first part of prepending the new content to the note. The text field is currently empty. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' into the empty text field was successful. The text field now contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send an Enter key event (keycode 66) to add a new line after the currently entered text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. The text field is currently focused and contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. This action is predicted to change the text field content to \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\', with the cursor on the new line. Actual Outcome: The action of sending an Enter key event (keycode 66) was successful. It added an additional newline character to the text field. The text field, which previously contained \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\' (according to XML data), now contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. This prepares the note for the original content to be appended after the new text and a blank line, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Append the original note content \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' to the currently focused text field. The text field currently contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of appending \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' was executed. The text field, which was supposed to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\', now contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\\'. This means the original content was added, but the crucial blank line (an extra newline) between the prepended text and the original content is missing. The action partially moved towards the subgoal by adding the original text, but failed to achieve the correct formatting. Corrective steps are needed to ensure the blank line is present.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\' currently contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\". This action is predicted to clear the text field, making it empty, which is the first step in correcting the previously mis-entered text. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' was successful. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\', which previously contained \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfpIR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\", is now empty. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by clearing the incorrect text, allowing for a fresh attempt to prepend the required text with the correct formatting.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' into the currently focused and empty text field. This is the first part of prepending the new content to the note. The text field is currently empty. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' into the empty text field was successful. The text field, which was previously empty, now contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. The XML data indicates the content is \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\', meaning a newline was automatically appended after the input text. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.

The text you can edit is: \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\n\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\n\\n\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nUpdate the Markor note 2023_08_10_neat_wolf.txt by adding the following text, along with a new blank line before the existing content: \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\", and rename it to busy_wolf_2023_07_23.txt.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' into the currently focused and empty text field. This is the first part of prepending the new content to the note. The text field is currently empty. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' into the empty text field was successful. The text field now contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send an Enter key event (keycode 66) to add a new line after the currently entered text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. The text field is currently focused and contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. This action is predicted to change the text field content to \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\', with the cursor on the new line. Actual Outcome: The action of sending an Enter key event (keycode 66) was successful. It added an additional newline character to the text field. The text field, which previously contained \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\' (according to XML data), now contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. This prepares the note for the original content to be appended after the new text and a blank line, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Append the original note content \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' to the currently focused text field. The text field currently contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of appending \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' was executed. The text field, which was supposed to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\', now contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\\'. This means the original content was added, but the crucial blank line (an extra newline) between the prepended text and the original content is missing. The action partially moved towards the subgoal by adding the original text, but failed to achieve the correct formatting. Corrective steps are needed to ensure the blank line is present.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\' currently contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\". This action is predicted to clear the text field, making it empty, which is the first step in correcting the previously mis-entered text. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' was successful. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\', which previously contained \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfpIR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\", is now empty. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by clearing the incorrect text, allowing for a fresh attempt to prepend the required text with the correct formatting.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' into the currently focused and empty text field. This is the first part of prepending the new content to the note. The text field is currently empty. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' into the empty text field was successful. The text field, which was previously empty, now contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. The XML data indicates the content is \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\', meaning a newline was automatically appended after the input text. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The next step is to add one more newline to create the required blank line before appending the original content.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 12: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send an Enter key event (keycode 66) to add a second newline character. The text field currently contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\'. This action is predicted to change the text field content to \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\', creating the required blank line before appending the original content.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text field is currently focused and contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. This action is predicted to change the text field content to \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\', with the cursor on the new line. Actual Outcome: The action of sending an Enter key event (keycode 66) was successful. It added an additional newline character to the text field. The text field, which previously contained \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\' (according to XML data), now contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. This prepares the note for the original content to be appended after the new text and a blank line, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Append the original note content \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' to the currently focused text field. The text field currently contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of appending \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' was executed. The text field, which was supposed to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\', now contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\\'. This means the original content was added, but the crucial blank line (an extra newline) between the prepended text and the original content is missing. The action partially moved towards the subgoal by adding the original text, but failed to achieve the correct formatting. Corrective steps are needed to ensure the blank line is present.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\' currently contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\". This action is predicted to clear the text field, making it empty, which is the first step in correcting the previously mis-entered text. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' was successful. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\', which previously contained \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfpIR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\", is now empty. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by clearing the incorrect text, allowing for a fresh attempt to prepend the required text with the correct formatting.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' into the currently focused and empty text field. This is the first part of prepending the new content to the note. The text field is currently empty. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' into the empty text field was successful. The text field, which was previously empty, now contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. The XML data indicates the content is \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\', meaning a newline was automatically appended after the input text. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The next step is to add one more newline to create the required blank line before appending the original content.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send an Enter key event (keycode 66) to add a second newline character. The text field currently contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\'. This action is predicted to change the text field content to \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\', creating the required blank line before appending the original content. Actual Outcome: The action of sending an Enter key event (keycode 66) was successful. It added a second newline character to the text field. The text field, which previously contained \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\' (according to XML data), now contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. This creates the required blank line before the original content is appended. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 42, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.44\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 66, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [73, 34, 100, 423], \\'text\\': \\'2023_08_10_ne.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 728, 95, 900], \\'text\\': \\'0 Q\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [135, 36, 155, 424], \\'text\\': \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfpIR\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [890, 143, 915, 336], \\'text\\': \\'= ,\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 653], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 907, 100, 985]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 593, 930, 703]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 833, 927, 933]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 242, 929, 345]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 521, 98, 606]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 822, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 949, 925, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 360, 939, 464]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 813, 102, 895]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 715, 100, 799]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 481, 939, 578]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 619, 99, 701]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 127, 927, 228]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 905, 36, 943]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 718, 927, 814]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 195, 37, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 14, 923, 103]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 425, 114, 508]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 140, 36, 189]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"0\", text=\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\n\\n\", resource-id=\"net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"net.gsantner.markor\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[0,275][1080,2102]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\n\\n\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text field is currently focused and contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. This action is predicted to change the text field content to \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\', with the cursor on the new line. Actual Outcome: The action of sending an Enter key event (keycode 66) was successful. It added an additional newline character to the text field. The text field, which previously contained \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\' (according to XML data), now contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. This prepares the note for the original content to be appended after the new text and a blank line, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Append the original note content \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' to the currently focused text field. The text field currently contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of appending \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' was executed. The text field, which was supposed to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\', now contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\\'. This means the original content was added, but the crucial blank line (an extra newline) between the prepended text and the original content is missing. The action partially moved towards the subgoal by adding the original text, but failed to achieve the correct formatting. Corrective steps are needed to ensure the blank line is present.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\' currently contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\". This action is predicted to clear the text field, making it empty, which is the first step in correcting the previously mis-entered text. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' was successful. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\', which previously contained \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfpIR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\", is now empty. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by clearing the incorrect text, allowing for a fresh attempt to prepend the required text with the correct formatting.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' into the currently focused and empty text field. This is the first part of prepending the new content to the note. The text field is currently empty. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' into the empty text field was successful. The text field, which was previously empty, now contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. The XML data indicates the content is \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\', meaning a newline was automatically appended after the input text. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The next step is to add one more newline to create the required blank line before appending the original content.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send an Enter key event (keycode 66) to add a second newline character. The text field currently contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\'. This action is predicted to change the text field content to \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\', creating the required blank line before appending the original content. Actual Outcome: The action of sending an Enter key event (keycode 66) was successful. It added a second newline character to the text field. The text field, which previously contained \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\' (according to XML data), now contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. This creates the required blank line before the original content is appended. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 13: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Append the original note content \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' to the currently focused text field.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text field currently contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of appending \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' was executed. The text field, which was supposed to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\', now contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\\'. This means the original content was added, but the crucial blank line (an extra newline) between the prepended text and the original content is missing. The action partially moved towards the subgoal by adding the original text, but failed to achieve the correct formatting. Corrective steps are needed to ensure the blank line is present.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\' currently contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\". This action is predicted to clear the text field, making it empty, which is the first step in correcting the previously mis-entered text. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' was successful. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\', which previously contained \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfpIR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\", is now empty. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by clearing the incorrect text, allowing for a fresh attempt to prepend the required text with the correct formatting.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' into the currently focused and empty text field. This is the first part of prepending the new content to the note. The text field is currently empty. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' into the empty text field was successful. The text field, which was previously empty, now contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. The XML data indicates the content is \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\', meaning a newline was automatically appended after the input text. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The next step is to add one more newline to create the required blank line before appending the original content.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send an Enter key event (keycode 66) to add a second newline character. The text field currently contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\'. This action is predicted to change the text field content to \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\', creating the required blank line before appending the original content. Actual Outcome: The action of sending an Enter key event (keycode 66) was successful. It added a second newline character to the text field. The text field, which previously contained \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\' (according to XML data), now contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. This creates the required blank line before the original content is appended. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Append the original note content \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' to the currently focused text field. The text field currently contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\'. Actual Outcome: The action was to append \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' to the text field, which was expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. The action resulted in the text field containing \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\\', as confirmed by the XML data. This outcome is incorrect because the required blank line (formed by two newline characters) between the prepended text and the original content is missing; only one newline is present. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal due to incorrect formatting.

The text you can edit is: \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\n\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 41, 36, 138], \\'text\\': \\'15.45\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [73, 35, 98, 423], \\'text\\': \\'2023_08_10_ne.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 727, 96, 889], \\'text\\': \\'0 Q\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [890, 143, 915, 336], \\'text\\': \\'= ,\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 653], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 907, 100, 985]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 833, 927, 933]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 594, 935, 700]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 242, 928, 345]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [879, 949, 925, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 822, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 813, 102, 895]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 716, 100, 799]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 481, 938, 578]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 619, 99, 701]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 521, 97, 603]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 362, 937, 463]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 126, 927, 229]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 717, 927, 815]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 905, 37, 943]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 7, 926, 105]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 195, 37, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 425, 113, 508]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"0\", text=\"\\n\", resource-id=\"net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"net.gsantner.markor\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[0,275][1080,2102]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"\\n\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nUpdate the Markor note 2023_08_10_neat_wolf.txt by adding the following text, along with a new blank line before the existing content: \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\", and rename it to busy_wolf_2023_07_23.txt.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Append the original note content \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' to the currently focused text field. The text field currently contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of appending \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' was executed. The text field, which was supposed to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\', now contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\\'. This means the original content was added, but the crucial blank line (an extra newline) between the prepended text and the original content is missing. The action partially moved towards the subgoal by adding the original text, but failed to achieve the correct formatting. Corrective steps are needed to ensure the blank line is present.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\' currently contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\". This action is predicted to clear the text field, making it empty, which is the first step in correcting the previously mis-entered text. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' was successful. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\', which previously contained \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfpIR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\", is now empty. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by clearing the incorrect text, allowing for a fresh attempt to prepend the required text with the correct formatting.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' into the currently focused and empty text field. This is the first part of prepending the new content to the note. The text field is currently empty. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' into the empty text field was successful. The text field, which was previously empty, now contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. The XML data indicates the content is \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\', meaning a newline was automatically appended after the input text. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The next step is to add one more newline to create the required blank line before appending the original content.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send an Enter key event (keycode 66) to add a second newline character. The text field currently contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\'. This action is predicted to change the text field content to \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\', creating the required blank line before appending the original content. Actual Outcome: The action of sending an Enter key event (keycode 66) was successful. It added a second newline character to the text field. The text field, which previously contained \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\' (according to XML data), now contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. This creates the required blank line before the original content is appended. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Append the original note content \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' to the currently focused text field. The text field currently contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\'. Actual Outcome: The action was to append \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' to the text field, which was expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. The action resulted in the text field containing \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\\', as confirmed by the XML data. This outcome is incorrect because the required blank line (formed by two newline characters) between the prepended text and the original content is missing; only one newline is present. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal due to incorrect formatting. The text field must be cleared, and the prepending process must be re-attempted to ensure the correct number of newlines.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 14: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\' currently contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\". This action will clear the text field, making it empty, which is the first step in correcting the previously mis-entered text.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\' currently contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\". This action is predicted to clear the text field, making it empty, which is the first step in correcting the previously mis-entered text. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' was successful. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\', which previously contained \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfpIR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\", is now empty. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by clearing the incorrect text, allowing for a fresh attempt to prepend the required text with the correct formatting.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' into the currently focused and empty text field. This is the first part of prepending the new content to the note. The text field is currently empty. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' into the empty text field was successful. The text field, which was previously empty, now contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. The XML data indicates the content is \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\', meaning a newline was automatically appended after the input text. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The next step is to add one more newline to create the required blank line before appending the original content.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send an Enter key event (keycode 66) to add a second newline character. The text field currently contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\'. This action is predicted to change the text field content to \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\', creating the required blank line before appending the original content. Actual Outcome: The action of sending an Enter key event (keycode 66) was successful. It added a second newline character to the text field. The text field, which previously contained \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\' (according to XML data), now contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. This creates the required blank line before the original content is appended. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Append the original note content \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' to the currently focused text field. The text field currently contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\'. Actual Outcome: The action was to append \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' to the text field, which was expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. The action resulted in the text field containing \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\\', as confirmed by the XML data. This outcome is incorrect because the required blank line (formed by two newline characters) between the prepended text and the original content is missing; only one newline is present. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal due to incorrect formatting. The text field must be cleared, and the prepending process must be re-attempted to ensure the correct number of newlines.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\' currently contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\". This action will clear the text field, making it empty, which is the first step in correcting the previously mis-entered text. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' (Step 14) was successful. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\', which previously contained \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\\', is now empty (XML shows text=\\'\\\\n\\'). This clears the way for a new attempt to correctly prepend the text as per the user\\'s instructions and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 41, 36, 138], \\'text\\': \\'15.45\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [73, 35, 98, 423], \\'text\\': \\'2023_08_10_ne.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 727, 96, 889], \\'text\\': \\'0 Q\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [890, 143, 915, 336], \\'text\\': \\'= ,\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 653], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 907, 100, 985]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 833, 927, 933]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 594, 935, 700]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 242, 928, 345]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [879, 949, 925, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 822, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 813, 102, 895]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 716, 100, 799]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 481, 938, 578]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 619, 99, 701]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 521, 97, 603]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 362, 937, 463]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 126, 927, 229]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 717, 927, 815]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 905, 37, 943]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 7, 926, 105]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 195, 37, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 425, 113, 508]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"0\", text=\"\\n\", resource-id=\"net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"net.gsantner.markor\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[0,275][1080,2102]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"\\n\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\' currently contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\". This action is predicted to clear the text field, making it empty, which is the first step in correcting the previously mis-entered text. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' was successful. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\', which previously contained \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfpIR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\", is now empty. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by clearing the incorrect text, allowing for a fresh attempt to prepend the required text with the correct formatting.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' into the currently focused and empty text field. This is the first part of prepending the new content to the note. The text field is currently empty. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' into the empty text field was successful. The text field, which was previously empty, now contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. The XML data indicates the content is \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\', meaning a newline was automatically appended after the input text. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The next step is to add one more newline to create the required blank line before appending the original content.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send an Enter key event (keycode 66) to add a second newline character. The text field currently contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\'. This action is predicted to change the text field content to \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\', creating the required blank line before appending the original content. Actual Outcome: The action of sending an Enter key event (keycode 66) was successful. It added a second newline character to the text field. The text field, which previously contained \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\' (according to XML data), now contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. This creates the required blank line before the original content is appended. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Append the original note content \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' to the currently focused text field. The text field currently contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\'. Actual Outcome: The action was to append \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' to the text field, which was expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. The action resulted in the text field containing \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\\', as confirmed by the XML data. This outcome is incorrect because the required blank line (formed by two newline characters) between the prepended text and the original content is missing; only one newline is present. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal due to incorrect formatting. The text field must be cleared, and the prepending process must be re-attempted to ensure the correct number of newlines.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\' currently contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\". This action will clear the text field, making it empty, which is the first step in correcting the previously mis-entered text. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' (Step 14) was successful. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\', which previously contained \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\\', is now empty (XML shows text=\\'\\\\n\\'). This clears the way for a new attempt to correctly prepend the text as per the user\\'s instructions and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 15: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\' into the currently focused text field. The text field is currently empty (or contains a single newline). This action is predicted to result in the text field containing \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\', which includes the new text and the required blank line.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is the first part of prepending the new content to the note. The text field is currently empty. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' into the empty text field was successful. The text field, which was previously empty, now contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. The XML data indicates the content is \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\', meaning a newline was automatically appended after the input text. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The next step is to add one more newline to create the required blank line before appending the original content.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send an Enter key event (keycode 66) to add a second newline character. The text field currently contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\'. This action is predicted to change the text field content to \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\', creating the required blank line before appending the original content. Actual Outcome: The action of sending an Enter key event (keycode 66) was successful. It added a second newline character to the text field. The text field, which previously contained \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\' (according to XML data), now contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. This creates the required blank line before the original content is appended. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Append the original note content \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' to the currently focused text field. The text field currently contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\'. Actual Outcome: The action was to append \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' to the text field, which was expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. The action resulted in the text field containing \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\\', as confirmed by the XML data. This outcome is incorrect because the required blank line (formed by two newline characters) between the prepended text and the original content is missing; only one newline is present. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal due to incorrect formatting. The text field must be cleared, and the prepending process must be re-attempted to ensure the correct number of newlines.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\' currently contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\". This action will clear the text field, making it empty, which is the first step in correcting the previously mis-entered text. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' (Step 14) was successful. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\', which previously contained \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\\', is now empty (XML shows text=\\'\\\\n\\'). This clears the way for a new attempt to correctly prepend the text as per the user\\'s instructions and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\' into the currently focused text field. The text field is currently empty (or contains a single newline). This action is predicted to result in the text field containing \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\', which includes the new text and the required blank line. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\" into the text field was successful. The text field, which was previously empty (or contained a single newline), now contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\" according to the XML data. This outcome correctly prepends the new text and creates the required blank line (two newlines) before the original content is to be appended.

The text you can edit is: \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\n\\n\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\n\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nUpdate the Markor note 2023_08_10_neat_wolf.txt by adding the following text, along with a new blank line before the existing content: \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\", and rename it to busy_wolf_2023_07_23.txt.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' into the currently focused and empty text field. This is the first part of prepending the new content to the note. The text field is currently empty. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\' into the empty text field was successful. The text field, which was previously empty, now contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\'. The XML data indicates the content is \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\', meaning a newline was automatically appended after the input text. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The next step is to add one more newline to create the required blank line before appending the original content.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send an Enter key event (keycode 66) to add a second newline character. The text field currently contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\'. This action is predicted to change the text field content to \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\', creating the required blank line before appending the original content. Actual Outcome: The action of sending an Enter key event (keycode 66) was successful. It added a second newline character to the text field. The text field, which previously contained \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\' (according to XML data), now contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. This creates the required blank line before the original content is appended. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Append the original note content \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' to the currently focused text field. The text field currently contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\'. Actual Outcome: The action was to append \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' to the text field, which was expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. The action resulted in the text field containing \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\\', as confirmed by the XML data. This outcome is incorrect because the required blank line (formed by two newline characters) between the prepended text and the original content is missing; only one newline is present. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal due to incorrect formatting. The text field must be cleared, and the prepending process must be re-attempted to ensure the correct number of newlines.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\' currently contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\". This action will clear the text field, making it empty, which is the first step in correcting the previously mis-entered text. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' (Step 14) was successful. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\', which previously contained \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\\', is now empty (XML shows text=\\'\\\\n\\'). This clears the way for a new attempt to correctly prepend the text as per the user\\'s instructions and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\' into the currently focused text field. The text field is currently empty (or contains a single newline). This action is predicted to result in the text field containing \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\', which includes the new text and the required blank line. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\" into the text field was successful. The text field, which was previously empty (or contained a single newline), now contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\" according to the XML data. This outcome correctly prepends the new text and creates the required blank line (two newlines) before the original content is to be appended. This action has brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 16: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Append the original note content \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' to the currently focused text field. The text field currently contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\'.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text field currently contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\'. This action is predicted to change the text field content to \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\', creating the required blank line before appending the original content. Actual Outcome: The action of sending an Enter key event (keycode 66) was successful. It added a second newline character to the text field. The text field, which previously contained \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\' (according to XML data), now contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. This creates the required blank line before the original content is appended. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Append the original note content \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' to the currently focused text field. The text field currently contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\'. Actual Outcome: The action was to append \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' to the text field, which was expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. The action resulted in the text field containing \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\\', as confirmed by the XML data. This outcome is incorrect because the required blank line (formed by two newline characters) between the prepended text and the original content is missing; only one newline is present. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal due to incorrect formatting. The text field must be cleared, and the prepending process must be re-attempted to ensure the correct number of newlines.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\' currently contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\". This action will clear the text field, making it empty, which is the first step in correcting the previously mis-entered text. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' (Step 14) was successful. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\', which previously contained \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\\', is now empty (XML shows text=\\'\\\\n\\'). This clears the way for a new attempt to correctly prepend the text as per the user\\'s instructions and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\' into the currently focused text field. The text field is currently empty (or contains a single newline). This action is predicted to result in the text field containing \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\', which includes the new text and the required blank line. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\" into the text field was successful. The text field, which was previously empty (or contained a single newline), now contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\" according to the XML data. This outcome correctly prepends the new text and creates the required blank line (two newlines) before the original content is to be appended. This action has brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Append the original note content \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' to the currently focused text field. The text field currently contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\'. Actual Outcome: The action was to append \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' to the text field. Before this action, the text field contained \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\' (new text + blank line). After the action, the text field contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\\', as confirmed by the XML data. This outcome is incorrect because the required blank line between the prepended text and the original content is missing; only one newline character separates them. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The text field needs to be cleared, and the entire content (prepended text + blank line + original content) should be input in one go.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\n\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text field currently contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\'. This action is predicted to change the text field content to \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\', creating the required blank line before appending the original content. Actual Outcome: The action of sending an Enter key event (keycode 66) was successful. It added a second newline character to the text field. The text field, which previously contained \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\' (according to XML data), now contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. This creates the required blank line before the original content is appended. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Append the original note content \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' to the currently focused text field. The text field currently contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\'. Actual Outcome: The action was to append \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' to the text field, which was expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. The action resulted in the text field containing \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\\', as confirmed by the XML data. This outcome is incorrect because the required blank line (formed by two newline characters) between the prepended text and the original content is missing; only one newline is present. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal due to incorrect formatting. The text field must be cleared, and the prepending process must be re-attempted to ensure the correct number of newlines.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\' currently contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\". This action will clear the text field, making it empty, which is the first step in correcting the previously mis-entered text. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' (Step 14) was successful. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\', which previously contained \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\\', is now empty (XML shows text=\\'\\\\n\\'). This clears the way for a new attempt to correctly prepend the text as per the user\\'s instructions and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\' into the currently focused text field. The text field is currently empty (or contains a single newline). This action is predicted to result in the text field containing \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\', which includes the new text and the required blank line. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\" into the text field was successful. The text field, which was previously empty (or contained a single newline), now contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\" according to the XML data. This outcome correctly prepends the new text and creates the required blank line (two newlines) before the original content is to be appended. This action has brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Append the original note content \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' to the currently focused text field. The text field currently contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\'. Actual Outcome: The action was to append \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' to the text field. Before this action, the text field contained \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\' (new text + blank line). After the action, the text field contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\\', as confirmed by the XML data. This outcome is incorrect because the required blank line between the prepended text and the original content is missing; only one newline character separates them. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The text field needs to be cleared, and the entire content (prepended text + blank line + original content) should be input in one go.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 17: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\'. The text field currently contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\". This action will clear the text field, preparing it for the correct input.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text field currently contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\'. Actual Outcome: The action was to append \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' to the text field, which was expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. The action resulted in the text field containing \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\\', as confirmed by the XML data. This outcome is incorrect because the required blank line (formed by two newline characters) between the prepended text and the original content is missing; only one newline is present. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal due to incorrect formatting. The text field must be cleared, and the prepending process must be re-attempted to ensure the correct number of newlines.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\' currently contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\". This action will clear the text field, making it empty, which is the first step in correcting the previously mis-entered text. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' (Step 14) was successful. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\', which previously contained \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\\', is now empty (XML shows text=\\'\\\\n\\'). This clears the way for a new attempt to correctly prepend the text as per the user\\'s instructions and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\' into the currently focused text field. The text field is currently empty (or contains a single newline). This action is predicted to result in the text field containing \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\', which includes the new text and the required blank line. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\" into the text field was successful. The text field, which was previously empty (or contained a single newline), now contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\" according to the XML data. This outcome correctly prepends the new text and creates the required blank line (two newlines) before the original content is to be appended. This action has brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Append the original note content \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' to the currently focused text field.

After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\'. Actual Outcome: The action was to append \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' to the text field. Before this action, the text field contained \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\' (new text + blank line). After the action, the text field contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\\', as confirmed by the XML data. This outcome is incorrect because the required blank line between the prepended text and the original content is missing; only one newline character separates them. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The text field needs to be cleared, and the entire content (prepended text + blank line + original content) should be input in one go.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\'. The text field currently contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\". This action will clear the text field, preparing it for the correct input. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' was successful. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\', which previously contained \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\\', is now empty (XML shows text=\\'\\\\n\\').

The text you can edit is: \"\\n\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\n\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\n\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nUpdate the Markor note 2023_08_10_neat_wolf.txt by adding the following text, along with a new blank line before the existing content: \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\", and rename it to busy_wolf_2023_07_23.txt.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Append the original note content \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' to the currently focused text field. The text field currently contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\'. Actual Outcome: The action was to append \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' to the text field, which was expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. The action resulted in the text field containing \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\\', as confirmed by the XML data. This outcome is incorrect because the required blank line (formed by two newline characters) between the prepended text and the original content is missing; only one newline is present. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal due to incorrect formatting. The text field must be cleared, and the prepending process must be re-attempted to ensure the correct number of newlines.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\' currently contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\". This action will clear the text field, making it empty, which is the first step in correcting the previously mis-entered text. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' (Step 14) was successful. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\', which previously contained \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\\', is now empty (XML shows text=\\'\\\\n\\'). This clears the way for a new attempt to correctly prepend the text as per the user\\'s instructions and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\' into the currently focused text field. The text field is currently empty (or contains a single newline). This action is predicted to result in the text field containing \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\', which includes the new text and the required blank line. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\" into the text field was successful. The text field, which was previously empty (or contained a single newline), now contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\" according to the XML data. This outcome correctly prepends the new text and creates the required blank line (two newlines) before the original content is to be appended. This action has brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Append the original note content \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' to the currently focused text field. The text field currently contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\'. Actual Outcome: The action was to append \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' to the text field. Before this action, the text field contained \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\' (new text + blank line). After the action, the text field contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\\', as confirmed by the XML data. This outcome is incorrect because the required blank line between the prepended text and the original content is missing; only one newline character separates them. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The text field needs to be cleared, and the entire content (prepended text + blank line + original content) should be input in one go.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\'. The text field currently contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\". This action will clear the text field, preparing it for the correct input. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' was successful. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\', which previously contained \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\\', is now empty (XML shows text=\\'\\\\n\\'). This prepares the text field for the correct input of the entire desired content, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 18: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the complete text \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\" into the currently focused and empty text field. This should result in the text field containing the new text, a blank line, and the original content, correctly formatted.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\' currently contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\". This action will clear the text field, making it empty, which is the first step in correcting the previously mis-entered text. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' (Step 14) was successful. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\', which previously contained \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\\', is now empty (XML shows text=\\'\\\\n\\'). This clears the way for a new attempt to correctly prepend the text as per the user\\'s instructions and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\' into the currently focused text field. The text field is currently empty (or contains a single newline). This action is predicted to result in the text field containing \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\', which includes the new text and the required blank line. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\" into the text field was successful. The text field, which was previously empty (or contained a single newline), now contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\" according to the XML data. This outcome correctly prepends the new text and creates the required blank line (two newlines) before the original content is to be appended. This action has brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Append the original note content \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' to the currently focused text field. The text field currently contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\'. Actual Outcome: The action was to append \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' to the text field. Before this action, the text field contained \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\' (new text + blank line). After the action, the text field contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\\', as confirmed by the XML data. This outcome is incorrect because the required blank line between the prepended text and the original content is missing; only one newline character separates them. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The text field needs to be cleared, and the entire content (prepended text + blank line + original content) should be input in one go.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\'. The text field currently contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\". This action will clear the text field, preparing it for the correct input. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' was successful. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\', which previously contained \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\\', is now empty (XML shows text=\\'\\\\n\\'). This prepares the text field for the correct input of the entire desired content, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the complete text \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\" into the currently focused and empty text field. This should result in the text field containing the new text, a blank line, and the original content, correctly formatted. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\" into the text field was successful. The text field now contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\", as confirmed by the XML data. This means the new text, a blank line, and the original content are all present and correctly formatted. This action has successfully completed the requirements for Subgoal 3, bringing the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\n\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\n\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\' currently contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\". This action will clear the text field, making it empty, which is the first step in correcting the previously mis-entered text. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' (Step 14) was successful. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\', which previously contained \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\\', is now empty (XML shows text=\\'\\\\n\\'). This clears the way for a new attempt to correctly prepend the text as per the user\\'s instructions and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\' into the currently focused text field. The text field is currently empty (or contains a single newline). This action is predicted to result in the text field containing \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\', which includes the new text and the required blank line. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\" into the text field was successful. The text field, which was previously empty (or contained a single newline), now contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\" according to the XML data. This outcome correctly prepends the new text and creates the required blank line (two newlines) before the original content is to be appended. This action has brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Append the original note content \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' to the currently focused text field. The text field currently contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\'. Actual Outcome: The action was to append \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' to the text field. Before this action, the text field contained \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\' (new text + blank line). After the action, the text field contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\\', as confirmed by the XML data. This outcome is incorrect because the required blank line between the prepended text and the original content is missing; only one newline character separates them. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The text field needs to be cleared, and the entire content (prepended text + blank line + original content) should be input in one go.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\'. The text field currently contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\". This action will clear the text field, preparing it for the correct input. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' was successful. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\', which previously contained \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\\', is now empty (XML shows text=\\'\\\\n\\'). This prepares the text field for the correct input of the entire desired content, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the complete text \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\" into the currently focused and empty text field. This should result in the text field containing the new text, a blank line, and the original content, correctly formatted. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\" into the text field was successful. The text field now contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\", as confirmed by the XML data. This means the new text, a blank line, and the original content are all present and correctly formatted. This action has successfully completed the requirements for Subgoal 3, bringing the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 19: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text field is currently empty (or contains a single newline). This action is predicted to result in the text field containing \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\', which includes the new text and the required blank line. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\" into the text field was successful. The text field, which was previously empty (or contained a single newline), now contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\" according to the XML data. This outcome correctly prepends the new text and creates the required blank line (two newlines) before the original content is to be appended. This action has brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Append the original note content \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' to the currently focused text field. The text field currently contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\'. Actual Outcome: The action was to append \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' to the text field. Before this action, the text field contained \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\' (new text + blank line). After the action, the text field contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\\', as confirmed by the XML data. This outcome is incorrect because the required blank line between the prepended text and the original content is missing; only one newline character separates them. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The text field needs to be cleared, and the entire content (prepended text + blank line + original content) should be input in one go.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\'. The text field currently contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\". This action will clear the text field, preparing it for the correct input. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' was successful. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\', which previously contained \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\\', is now empty (XML shows text=\\'\\\\n\\'). This prepares the text field for the correct input of the entire desired content, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the complete text \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\" into the currently focused and empty text field. This should result in the text field containing the new text, a blank line, and the original content, correctly formatted. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\" into the text field was successful. The text field now contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\", as confirmed by the XML data. This means the new text, a blank line, and the original content are all present and correctly formatted. This action has successfully completed the requirements for Subgoal 3, bringing the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approximate coordinates [83, 946]). This action is predicted to open a context menu with options including \\'Rename\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [83, 946] was successful. A menu appeared on the right side of the screen. The menu is titled \\'File settings\\' and lists the following options: \\'File settings\\', \\'Share\\', \\'Tools\\', \\'Info\\', and \\'Reload\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4 (renaming the note) by opening a menu that potentially contains the \\'Rename\\' option or leads to it.

Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nUpdate the Markor note 2023_08_10_neat_wolf.txt by adding the following text, along with a new blank line before the existing content: \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\", and rename it to busy_wolf_2023_07_23.txt.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\' into the currently focused text field. The text field is currently empty (or contains a single newline). This action is predicted to result in the text field containing \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\', which includes the new text and the required blank line. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\" into the text field was successful. The text field, which was previously empty (or contained a single newline), now contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\" according to the XML data. This outcome correctly prepends the new text and creates the required blank line (two newlines) before the original content is to be appended. This action has brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Append the original note content \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' to the currently focused text field. The text field currently contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\'. Actual Outcome: The action was to append \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' to the text field. Before this action, the text field contained \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\' (new text + blank line). After the action, the text field contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\\', as confirmed by the XML data. This outcome is incorrect because the required blank line between the prepended text and the original content is missing; only one newline character separates them. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The text field needs to be cleared, and the entire content (prepended text + blank line + original content) should be input in one go.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\'. The text field currently contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\". This action will clear the text field, preparing it for the correct input. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' was successful. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\', which previously contained \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\\', is now empty (XML shows text=\\'\\\\n\\'). This prepares the text field for the correct input of the entire desired content, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the complete text \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\" into the currently focused and empty text field. This should result in the text field containing the new text, a blank line, and the original content, correctly formatted. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\" into the text field was successful. The text field now contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\", as confirmed by the XML data. This means the new text, a blank line, and the original content are all present and correctly formatted. This action has successfully completed the requirements for Subgoal 3, bringing the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approximate coordinates [83, 946]). This action is predicted to open a context menu with options including \\'Rename\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [83, 946] was successful. A menu appeared on the right side of the screen. The menu is titled \\'File settings\\' and lists the following options: \\'File settings\\', \\'Share\\', \\'Tools\\', \\'Info\\', and \\'Reload\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4 (renaming the note) by opening a menu that potentially contains the \\'Rename\\' option or leads to it. The \\'Rename\\' option is not directly visible in this initial menu.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 20: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,715],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'File settings\\' option in the currently open menu. This option is located at approximately [85, 715]. This action is predicted to open a new menu or screen related to file settings, where the \\'Rename\\' option might be found. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen is visible. `is_markor_app_installed_and_opened` is set to \\'true\\'.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text field currently contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\'. Actual Outcome: The action was to append \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' to the text field. Before this action, the text field contained \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\' (new text + blank line). After the action, the text field contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\\', as confirmed by the XML data. This outcome is incorrect because the required blank line between the prepended text and the original content is missing; only one newline character separates them. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The text field needs to be cleared, and the entire content (prepended text + blank line + original content) should be input in one go.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\'. The text field currently contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\". This action will clear the text field, preparing it for the correct input. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' was successful. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\', which previously contained \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\\', is now empty (XML shows text=\\'\\\\n\\'). This prepares the text field for the correct input of the entire desired content, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the complete text \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\" into the currently focused and empty text field. This should result in the text field containing the new text, a blank line, and the original content, correctly formatted. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\" into the text field was successful. The text field now contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\", as confirmed by the XML data. This means the new text, a blank line, and the original content are all present and correctly formatted. This action has successfully completed the requirements for Subgoal 3, bringing the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approximate coordinates [83, 946]). This action is predicted to open a context menu with options including \\'Rename\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [83, 946] was successful. A menu appeared on the right side of the screen. The menu is titled \\'File settings\\' and lists the following options: \\'File settings\\', \\'Share\\', \\'Tools\\', \\'Info\\', and \\'Reload\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4 (renaming the note) by opening a menu that potentially contains the \\'Rename\\' option or leads to it. The \\'Rename\\' option is not directly visible in this initial menu.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,715],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'File settings\\' option in the currently open menu. This option is located at approximately [85, 715]. This action is predicted to open a new menu or screen related to file settings, where the \\'Rename\\' option might be found. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'File settings\\' was successful. It opened a new menu with options: \\'Wrap words\\', \\'Syntax highlighting\\', \\'Auto-format\\', \\'Font Size\\', and \\'Format\\'. This new menu is a sub-menu of \\'File settings\\'. The \\'Rename\\' option was not found in this sub-menu. The agent is closer to finding the rename option by exploring the menu system, but the current path did not lead to it directly. The next step is to go back and try a different path.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 42, 36, 132], \\'text\\': \\'15.51\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 65, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [73, 34, 100, 423], \\'text\\': \\'2023_08_10_ne.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [73, 488, 97, 690], \\'text\\': \\'File settings\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [135, 36, 155, 424], \\'text\\': \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfpIR\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [127, 552, 149, 766], \\'text\\': \\'Wrap words\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [174, 36, 195, 466], \\'text\\': \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [179, 550, 203, 889], \\'text\\': \\'Syntax highlighting\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [232, 552, 251, 772], \\'text\\': \\'Auto-format\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [283, 482, 305, 721], \\'text\\': \\'TT Font Size\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [331, 471, 360, 686], \\'text\\': \\'fi Format\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [890, 143, 915, 336], \\'text\\': \\'= ,\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 653], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [216, 454, 269, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [164, 453, 216, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [268, 451, 321, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [110, 451, 164, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 833, 923, 934]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [883, 592, 924, 702]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 358, 945, 469]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 949, 922, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [883, 717, 922, 814]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 125, 924, 230]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [883, 483, 925, 579]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 239, 930, 347]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 822, 35, 899]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 8, 923, 106]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 906, 35, 941]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 456, 111, 997]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 196, 37, 241]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text field currently contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\'. After this action, the text field is expected to contain \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\'. Actual Outcome: The action was to append \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\' to the text field. Before this action, the text field contained \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\n\\' (new text + blank line). After the action, the text field contains \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\\', as confirmed by the XML data. This outcome is incorrect because the required blank line between the prepended text and the original content is missing; only one newline character separates them. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The text field needs to be cleared, and the entire content (prepended text + blank line + original content) should be input in one go.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\'. The text field currently contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\". This action will clear the text field, preparing it for the correct input. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' was successful. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\', which previously contained \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\\', is now empty (XML shows text=\\'\\\\n\\'). This prepares the text field for the correct input of the entire desired content, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the complete text \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\" into the currently focused and empty text field. This should result in the text field containing the new text, a blank line, and the original content, correctly formatted. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\" into the text field was successful. The text field now contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\", as confirmed by the XML data. This means the new text, a blank line, and the original content are all present and correctly formatted. This action has successfully completed the requirements for Subgoal 3, bringing the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approximate coordinates [83, 946]). This action is predicted to open a context menu with options including \\'Rename\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [83, 946] was successful. A menu appeared on the right side of the screen. The menu is titled \\'File settings\\' and lists the following options: \\'File settings\\', \\'Share\\', \\'Tools\\', \\'Info\\', and \\'Reload\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4 (renaming the note) by opening a menu that potentially contains the \\'Rename\\' option or leads to it. The \\'Rename\\' option is not directly visible in this initial menu.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,715],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'File settings\\' option in the currently open menu. This option is located at approximately [85, 715]. This action is predicted to open a new menu or screen related to file settings, where the \\'Rename\\' option might be found. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'File settings\\' was successful. It opened a new menu with options: \\'Wrap words\\', \\'Syntax highlighting\\', \\'Auto-format\\', \\'Font Size\\', and \\'Format\\'. This new menu is a sub-menu of \\'File settings\\'. The \\'Rename\\' option was not found in this sub-menu. The agent is closer to finding the rename option by exploring the menu system, but the current path did not lead to it directly. The next step is to go back and try a different path.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 21: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,468],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located at approximately [85, 468], which is to the left of the \\'File settings\\' title in the current menu. This action is predicted to close the current \\'File settings\\' sub-menu and return to the previous menu where options like \\'Share\\', \\'Tools\\', \\'Info\\', and \\'Reload\\' were visible. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen is visible. `is_markor_app_installed_and_opened` is set to \\'true\\'.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text field currently contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\". This action will clear the text field, preparing it for the correct input. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' was successful. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\', which previously contained \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\\', is now empty (XML shows text=\\'\\\\n\\'). This prepares the text field for the correct input of the entire desired content, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the complete text \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\" into the currently focused and empty text field. This should result in the text field containing the new text, a blank line, and the original content, correctly formatted. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\" into the text field was successful. The text field now contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\", as confirmed by the XML data. This means the new text, a blank line, and the original content are all present and correctly formatted. This action has successfully completed the requirements for Subgoal 3, bringing the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approximate coordinates [83, 946]). This action is predicted to open a context menu with options including \\'Rename\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [83, 946] was successful. A menu appeared on the right side of the screen. The menu is titled \\'File settings\\' and lists the following options: \\'File settings\\', \\'Share\\', \\'Tools\\', \\'Info\\', and \\'Reload\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4 (renaming the note) by opening a menu that potentially contains the \\'Rename\\' option or leads to it. The \\'Rename\\' option is not directly visible in this initial menu.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,715],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'File settings\\' option in the currently open menu. This option is located at approximately [85, 715]. This action is predicted to open a new menu or screen related to file settings, where the \\'Rename\\' option might be found. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'File settings\\' was successful. It opened a new menu with options: \\'Wrap words\\', \\'Syntax highlighting\\', \\'Auto-format\\', \\'Font Size\\', and \\'Format\\'. This new menu is a sub-menu of \\'File settings\\'. The \\'Rename\\' option was not found in this sub-menu. The agent is closer to finding the rename option by exploring the menu system, but the current path did not lead to it directly. The next step is to go back and try a different path.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,468],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located at approximately [85, 468], which is to the left of the \\'File settings\\' title in the current menu. This action is predicted to close the current \\'File settings\\' sub-menu and return to the previous menu where options like \\'Share\\', \\'Tools\\', \\'Info\\', and \\'Reload\\' were visible. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon at [85, 468] failed. The \\'File settings\\' sub-menu remained on the screen, and the agent did not navigate back to the previous menu. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of renaming the note.

Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\n\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\n\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nUpdate the Markor note 2023_08_10_neat_wolf.txt by adding the following text, along with a new blank line before the existing content: \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\", and rename it to busy_wolf_2023_07_23.txt.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\'. The text field currently contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\". This action will clear the text field, preparing it for the correct input. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' was successful. The text field \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\\', which previously contained \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\\', is now empty (XML shows text=\\'\\\\n\\'). This prepares the text field for the correct input of the entire desired content, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the complete text \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\" into the currently focused and empty text field. This should result in the text field containing the new text, a blank line, and the original content, correctly formatted. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\" into the text field was successful. The text field now contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\", as confirmed by the XML data. This means the new text, a blank line, and the original content are all present and correctly formatted. This action has successfully completed the requirements for Subgoal 3, bringing the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approximate coordinates [83, 946]). This action is predicted to open a context menu with options including \\'Rename\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [83, 946] was successful. A menu appeared on the right side of the screen. The menu is titled \\'File settings\\' and lists the following options: \\'File settings\\', \\'Share\\', \\'Tools\\', \\'Info\\', and \\'Reload\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4 (renaming the note) by opening a menu that potentially contains the \\'Rename\\' option or leads to it. The \\'Rename\\' option is not directly visible in this initial menu.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,715],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'File settings\\' option in the currently open menu. This option is located at approximately [85, 715]. This action is predicted to open a new menu or screen related to file settings, where the \\'Rename\\' option might be found. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'File settings\\' was successful. It opened a new menu with options: \\'Wrap words\\', \\'Syntax highlighting\\', \\'Auto-format\\', \\'Font Size\\', and \\'Format\\'. This new menu is a sub-menu of \\'File settings\\'. The \\'Rename\\' option was not found in this sub-menu. The agent is closer to finding the rename option by exploring the menu system, but the current path did not lead to it directly. The next step is to go back and try a different path.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,468],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located at approximately [85, 468], which is to the left of the \\'File settings\\' title in the current menu. This action is predicted to close the current \\'File settings\\' sub-menu and return to the previous menu where options like \\'Share\\', \\'Tools\\', \\'Info\\', and \\'Reload\\' were visible. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon at [85, 468] failed. The \\'File settings\\' sub-menu remained on the screen, and the agent did not navigate back to the previous menu. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of renaming the note. A different approach is needed to go back to the previous menu.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 22: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button (KEYCODE_BACK). This is predicted to close the current \\'File settings\\' sub-menu and return to the previous menu where options like \\'Share\\', \\'Tools\\', \\'Info\\', and \\'Reload\\' were visible. The current menu is \\'File settings\\' with options \\'Wrap words\\', \\'Syntax highlighting\\', etc. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen is visible. `is_markor_app_installed_and_opened` is set to \\'true\\'.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This should result in the text field containing the new text, a blank line, and the original content, correctly formatted. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\" into the text field was successful. The text field now contains \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\\\n\\\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\\\n\", as confirmed by the XML data. This means the new text, a blank line, and the original content are all present and correctly formatted. This action has successfully completed the requirements for Subgoal 3, bringing the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approximate coordinates [83, 946]). This action is predicted to open a context menu with options including \\'Rename\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [83, 946] was successful. A menu appeared on the right side of the screen. The menu is titled \\'File settings\\' and lists the following options: \\'File settings\\', \\'Share\\', \\'Tools\\', \\'Info\\', and \\'Reload\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4 (renaming the note) by opening a menu that potentially contains the \\'Rename\\' option or leads to it. The \\'Rename\\' option is not directly visible in this initial menu.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,715],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'File settings\\' option in the currently open menu. This option is located at approximately [85, 715]. This action is predicted to open a new menu or screen related to file settings, where the \\'Rename\\' option might be found. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'File settings\\' was successful. It opened a new menu with options: \\'Wrap words\\', \\'Syntax highlighting\\', \\'Auto-format\\', \\'Font Size\\', and \\'Format\\'. This new menu is a sub-menu of \\'File settings\\'. The \\'Rename\\' option was not found in this sub-menu. The agent is closer to finding the rename option by exploring the menu system, but the current path did not lead to it directly. The next step is to go back and try a different path.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,468],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located at approximately [85, 468], which is to the left of the \\'File settings\\' title in the current menu. This action is predicted to close the current \\'File settings\\' sub-menu and return to the previous menu where options like \\'Share\\', \\'Tools\\', \\'Info\\', and \\'Reload\\' were visible. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon at [85, 468] failed. The \\'File settings\\' sub-menu remained on the screen, and the agent did not navigate back to the previous menu. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of renaming the note. A different approach is needed to go back to the previous menu.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button (KEYCODE_BACK). This is predicted to close the current \\'File settings\\' sub-menu and return to the previous menu where options like \\'Share\\', \\'Tools\\', \\'Info\\', and \\'Reload\\' were visible. The current menu is \\'File settings\\' with options \\'Wrap words\\', \\'Syntax highlighting\\', etc. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the \\'File settings\\' sub-menu. However, it also closed the parent menu, returning the view to the main note editor. This means we are no longer in any menu. To find the \\'Rename\\' option, we need to open the main menu again.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.52\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [73, 34, 100, 423], \\'text\\': \\'2023_08_10_ne.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 728, 95, 900], \\'text\\': \\'0 Q\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [135, 36, 155, 424], \\'text\\': \\'RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfpIR\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [173, 36, 195, 768], \\'text\\': \\'Weekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain |\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [890, 143, 915, 336], \\'text\\': \\'= ,\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 653], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 822, 35, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 909, 100, 984]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 836, 927, 930]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 814, 102, 894]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 718, 100, 797]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 596, 935, 699]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 905, 36, 942]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 620, 99, 700]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 240, 928, 343]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 952, 925, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 487, 937, 574]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 521, 98, 603]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 37, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 128, 927, 227]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 363, 938, 459]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 722, 925, 812]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 141, 37, 188]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [883, 15, 923, 100]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [52, 853, 67, 1000]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"0\", text=\"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\n\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\n\", resource-id=\"net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"net.gsantner.markor\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[0,275][1080,2102]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"RnI8sP34yDzJQbvkfplR\\n\\nWeekend plans: Hiking trip to Blue Mountain.\\n\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",
