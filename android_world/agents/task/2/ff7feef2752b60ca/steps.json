Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The existence and path of this file are unknown and need to be determined (`originalFileExistsAndPath`).

Confirmation of this step\\'s success is needed (`fileContentUpdateConfirmation`).\\n4.  **Rename File (Subgoal 4):** After updating and saving the content, the file needs to be renamed to `lively_fox_2023_03_22.md`.

Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [123, 46, 147, 306], \\'text\\': \\'Sun; Oct 15\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 336, 722, 431], \\'text\\': \\'Gmail\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 561, 722, 676], \\'text\\': \\'Photos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [704, 781, 722, 921], \\'text\\': \\'YouTube\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [775, 295, 872, 709], \\'text\\': \\'0 (9\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 72, 855, 232]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [788, 765, 856, 929]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 535, 858, 706]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [628, 536, 729, 694]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 299, 856, 466]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 764, 728, 927]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 299, 730, 463]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [900, 701, 948, 795]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [892, 801, 952, 925]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 823, 39, 899]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[867,614],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon, which is located at approximately [867, 614]. This action is predicted to open the Markor app, bringing the agent to the app\\'s main screen. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Markor app icon was successful. The Markor app launched and is now displaying its file browser screen. This completes the first subgoal and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is predicted to reveal the list of installed applications, where I can then find and tap the Markor app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Markor app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[867,614],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon, which is located at approximately [867, 614]. This action is predicted to open the Markor app, bringing the agent to the app\\'s main screen. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Markor app icon was successful. The Markor app launched and is now displaying its file browser screen. This completes the first subgoal and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction. The file `strong_jacket_h1hZ.txt` is visible in the list.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 2: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is predicted to reveal the list of installed applications, where I can then find and tap the Markor app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Markor app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[867,614],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon, which is located at approximately [867, 614]. This action is predicted to open the Markor app, bringing the agent to the app\\'s main screen. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Markor app icon was successful. The Markor app launched and is now displaying its file browser screen. This completes the first subgoal and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction. The file `strong_jacket_h1hZ.txt` is visible in the list.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[438,384],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file `strong_jacket_h1hZ.txt` located at approximately `[438, 384]` to open it. This action is predicted to open the file in Markor\\'s editor, allowing its content to be viewed and edited. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the file `strong_jacket_h1hZ.txt` was successful. The Markor app opened the file in its editor, and the content \"pZwh1hZwvmPj5inNqu8U\" is now visible. This action completed Subgoal 2 and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.36\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \\'{\\\\\\'box_2d\\\\\\': [71, 31, 103, 383], \\\\\\'text\\\\\\': \\\\\\'strong_jacket _\"\\\\\\'}\\', \"{\\'box_2d\\': [135, 34, 155, 459], \\'text\\': \\'pZwhIhZwvmPjSinNqu8U\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [938, 150, 962, 332], \\'text\\': \\'= ,\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 833, 972, 932]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 951, 971, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [930, 718, 969, 813]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [931, 602, 967, 693]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [930, 484, 970, 576]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 822, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 909, 100, 985]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [928, 243, 973, 343]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 366, 973, 456]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [928, 129, 972, 227]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [985, 362, 1000, 634]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [931, 15, 969, 101]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 811, 103, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 617, 100, 702]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 517, 98, 609]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 905, 37, 943]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 38, 239]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 712, 100, 799]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 107, 37, 189]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"pZwh1hZwvmPj5inNqu8U\\n\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nUpdate the content of strong_jacket_h1hZ.txt to \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" in Markor and change its name to lively_fox_2023_03_22.md.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 3 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (start_point: [900, 500]) to the top-middle of the screen (end_point: [100, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is predicted to reveal the list of installed applications, where I can then find and tap the Markor app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Markor app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

This action is predicted to open the Markor app, bringing the agent to the app\\'s main screen. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Markor app icon was successful. The Markor app launched and is now displaying its file browser screen. This completes the first subgoal and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.

This action is predicted to open the file in Markor\\'s editor, allowing its content to be viewed and edited. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the file `strong_jacket_h1hZ.txt` was successful. The Markor app opened the file in its editor, and the content \"pZwh1hZwvmPj5inNqu8U\" is now visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"pZwh1hZwvmPj5inNqu8U\\n\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"\\n\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nUpdate the content of strong_jacket_h1hZ.txt to \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" in Markor and change its name to lively_fox_2023_03_22.md.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 4 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (start_point: [900, 500]) to the top-middle of the screen (end_point: [100, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is predicted to reveal the list of installed applications, where I can then find and tap the Markor app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Markor app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[867,614],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon, which is located at approximately [867, 614]. This action is predicted to open the Markor app, bringing the agent to the app\\'s main screen. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Markor app icon was successful. The Markor app launched and is now displaying its file browser screen. This completes the first subgoal and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction. The file `strong_jacket_h1hZ.txt` is visible in the list.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[438,384],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file `strong_jacket_h1hZ.txt` located at approximately `[438, 384]` to open it. This action is predicted to open the file in Markor\\'s editor, allowing its content to be viewed and edited. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the file `strong_jacket_h1hZ.txt` was successful. The Markor app opened the file in its editor, and the content \"pZwh1hZwvmPj5inNqu8U\" is now visible. This action completed Subgoal 2 and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[145,247],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the text \"pZwh1hZwvmPj5inNqu8U\" at approximately `[145, 247]` to select it. This is predicted to highlight the text and show options like \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Paste\\', or \\'Select All\\'. Actual Outcome: The long press action successfully selected the text \"pZwh1hZwvmPj5inNqu8U\" and displayed a context menu with options like \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Paste\\'. This brings the agent closer to updating the file content by allowing manipulation of the existing text.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 4: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[98,384],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Cut\" option in the context menu, located at approximately [98, 384]. This will remove the currently selected text \"pZwh1hZwvmPj5inNqu8U\" from the editor. The text field should then be empty, ready for new input.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \"Cut\" option was successful. The selected text \"pZwh1hZwvmPj5inNqu8U\" was removed from the editor. The text field is now empty and ready for the new content to be inputted. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of updating the file content.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"\\n\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\\n\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nUpdate the content of strong_jacket_h1hZ.txt to \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" in Markor and change its name to lively_fox_2023_03_22.md.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (start_point: [900, 500]) to the top-middle of the screen (end_point: [100, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is predicted to reveal the list of installed applications, where I can then find and tap the Markor app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Markor app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[867,614],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon, which is located at approximately [867, 614]. This action is predicted to open the Markor app, bringing the agent to the app\\'s main screen. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Markor app icon was successful. The Markor app launched and is now displaying its file browser screen. This completes the first subgoal and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction. The file `strong_jacket_h1hZ.txt` is visible in the list.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[438,384],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file `strong_jacket_h1hZ.txt` located at approximately `[438, 384]` to open it. This action is predicted to open the file in Markor\\'s editor, allowing its content to be viewed and edited. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the file `strong_jacket_h1hZ.txt` was successful. The Markor app opened the file in its editor, and the content \"pZwh1hZwvmPj5inNqu8U\" is now visible. This action completed Subgoal 2 and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[145,247],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the text \"pZwh1hZwvmPj5inNqu8U\" at approximately `[145, 247]` to select it. This is predicted to highlight the text and show options like \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Paste\\', or \\'Select All\\'. Actual Outcome: The long press action successfully selected the text \"pZwh1hZwvmPj5inNqu8U\" and displayed a context menu with options like \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Paste\\'. This brings the agent closer to updating the file content by allowing manipulation of the existing text.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[98,384],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Cut\" option in the context menu, located at approximately [98, 384]. This will remove the currently selected text \"pZwh1hZwvmPj5inNqu8U\" from the editor. The text field should then be empty, ready for new input. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \"Cut\" option was successful. The selected text \"pZwh1hZwvmPj5inNqu8U\" was removed from the editor. The text field is now empty and ready for the new content to be inputted. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of updating the file content.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 5: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" into the currently focused text editor. The editor is currently empty. After this action, the editor should contain the new text. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen (e.g., file browser or welcome screen) is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Actual Outcome: The long press action successfully selected the text \"pZwh1hZwvmPj5inNqu8U\" and displayed a context menu with options like \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Paste\\'. This brings the agent closer to updating the file content by allowing manipulation of the existing text.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[98,384],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Cut\" option in the context menu, located at approximately [98, 384]. This will remove the currently selected text \"pZwh1hZwvmPj5inNqu8U\" from the editor. The text field should then be empty, ready for new input. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \"Cut\" option was successful. The selected text \"pZwh1hZwvmPj5inNqu8U\" was removed from the editor. The text field is now empty and ready for the new content to be inputted. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of updating the file content.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" into the currently focused text editor. The editor is currently empty. After this action, the editor should contain the new text. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting text \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" was successful. The text editor now displays this text, as confirmed by the second screenshot and the XML data. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of updating the file content. The next step is to save these changes.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\\n\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"- [ ] inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\\n\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nUpdate the content of strong_jacket_h1hZ.txt to \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" in Markor and change its name to lively_fox_2023_03_22.md.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[867,614],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon, which is located at approximately [867, 614]. This action is predicted to open the Markor app, bringing the agent to the app\\'s main screen. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Markor app icon was successful. The Markor app launched and is now displaying its file browser screen. This completes the first subgoal and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction. The file `strong_jacket_h1hZ.txt` is visible in the list.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[438,384],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file `strong_jacket_h1hZ.txt` located at approximately `[438, 384]` to open it. This action is predicted to open the file in Markor\\'s editor, allowing its content to be viewed and edited. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the file `strong_jacket_h1hZ.txt` was successful. The Markor app opened the file in its editor, and the content \"pZwh1hZwvmPj5inNqu8U\" is now visible. This action completed Subgoal 2 and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[145,247],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the text \"pZwh1hZwvmPj5inNqu8U\" at approximately `[145, 247]` to select it. This is predicted to highlight the text and show options like \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Paste\\', or \\'Select All\\'. Actual Outcome: The long press action successfully selected the text \"pZwh1hZwvmPj5inNqu8U\" and displayed a context menu with options like \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Paste\\'. This brings the agent closer to updating the file content by allowing manipulation of the existing text.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[98,384],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Cut\" option in the context menu, located at approximately [98, 384]. This will remove the currently selected text \"pZwh1hZwvmPj5inNqu8U\" from the editor. The text field should then be empty, ready for new input. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \"Cut\" option was successful. The selected text \"pZwh1hZwvmPj5inNqu8U\" was removed from the editor. The text field is now empty and ready for the new content to be inputted. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of updating the file content.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" into the currently focused text editor. The editor is currently empty. After this action, the editor should contain the new text. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting text \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" was successful. The text editor now displays this text, as confirmed by the second screenshot and the XML data. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of updating the file content. The next step is to save these changes.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 6: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[903,56],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkmark icon at the bottom left of the screen, located at approximately `[903, 56]`. This action is predicted to save the changes made to the file content. The editor view might close, or there might be a confirmation message. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen (e.g., file browser or welcome screen) is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[438,384],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file `strong_jacket_h1hZ.txt` located at approximately `[438, 384]` to open it. This action is predicted to open the file in Markor\\'s editor, allowing its content to be viewed and edited. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the file `strong_jacket_h1hZ.txt` was successful. The Markor app opened the file in its editor, and the content \"pZwh1hZwvmPj5inNqu8U\" is now visible. This action completed Subgoal 2 and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[145,247],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the text \"pZwh1hZwvmPj5inNqu8U\" at approximately `[145, 247]` to select it. This is predicted to highlight the text and show options like \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Paste\\', or \\'Select All\\'. Actual Outcome: The long press action successfully selected the text \"pZwh1hZwvmPj5inNqu8U\" and displayed a context menu with options like \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Paste\\'. This brings the agent closer to updating the file content by allowing manipulation of the existing text.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[98,384],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Cut\" option in the context menu, located at approximately [98, 384]. This will remove the currently selected text \"pZwh1hZwvmPj5inNqu8U\" from the editor. The text field should then be empty, ready for new input. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \"Cut\" option was successful. The selected text \"pZwh1hZwvmPj5inNqu8U\" was removed from the editor. The text field is now empty and ready for the new content to be inputted. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of updating the file content.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" into the currently focused text editor. The editor is currently empty. After this action, the editor should contain the new text. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting text \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" was successful. The text editor now displays this text, as confirmed by the second screenshot and the XML data. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of updating the file content. The next step is to save these changes.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[903,56],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkmark icon at the bottom left of the screen, located at approximately `[903, 56]`. This action is predicted to save the changes made to the file content. The editor view might close, or there might be a confirmation message. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the checkmark icon at `[903, 56]` (bottom left) was unsuccessful in saving the file. Instead of saving, the action prepended the markdown syntax for a checkbox, \"- [ ] \", to the existing text. The text changed from \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" to \"- [ ] inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\". This outcome moves the agent further from completing the subgoal of updating the file content as intended. The immediate next steps must involve correcting the text and then identifying and using the correct save mechanism.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 42, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.38\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \\'{\\\\\\'box_2d\\\\\\': [71, 31, 103, 383], \\\\\\'text\\\\\\': \\\\\\'strong_jacket _\"\\\\\\'}\\', \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 728, 95, 900], \\'text\\': \\'0 Q\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [133, 51, 157, 523], \\'text\\': \\'[] inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7l\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [891, 147, 914, 335], \\'text\\': \\'= :=\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 653], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 909, 100, 984]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 822, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 835, 927, 931]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 619, 99, 700]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 594, 935, 700]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 813, 102, 895]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 717, 100, 798]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 243, 928, 344]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 951, 925, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 519, 97, 604]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 483, 939, 576]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 362, 939, 462]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 127, 927, 226]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 905, 36, 943]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 37, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 9, 925, 102]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 720, 926, 813]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 141, 37, 188]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 425, 112, 509]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"0\", text=\"- [ ] inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\\n\", resource-id=\"net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"net.gsantner.markor\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[0,275][1080,2102]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"- [ ] inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\\n\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[438,384],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file `strong_jacket_h1hZ.txt` located at approximately `[438, 384]` to open it. This action is predicted to open the file in Markor\\'s editor, allowing its content to be viewed and edited. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the file `strong_jacket_h1hZ.txt` was successful. The Markor app opened the file in its editor, and the content \"pZwh1hZwvmPj5inNqu8U\" is now visible. This action completed Subgoal 2 and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[145,247],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the text \"pZwh1hZwvmPj5inNqu8U\" at approximately `[145, 247]` to select it. This is predicted to highlight the text and show options like \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Paste\\', or \\'Select All\\'. Actual Outcome: The long press action successfully selected the text \"pZwh1hZwvmPj5inNqu8U\" and displayed a context menu with options like \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Paste\\'. This brings the agent closer to updating the file content by allowing manipulation of the existing text.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[98,384],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Cut\" option in the context menu, located at approximately [98, 384]. This will remove the currently selected text \"pZwh1hZwvmPj5inNqu8U\" from the editor. The text field should then be empty, ready for new input. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \"Cut\" option was successful. The selected text \"pZwh1hZwvmPj5inNqu8U\" was removed from the editor. The text field is now empty and ready for the new content to be inputted. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of updating the file content.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" into the currently focused text editor. The editor is currently empty. After this action, the editor should contain the new text. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting text \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" was successful. The text editor now displays this text, as confirmed by the second screenshot and the XML data. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of updating the file content. The next step is to save these changes.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[903,56],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkmark icon at the bottom left of the screen, located at approximately `[903, 56]`. This action is predicted to save the changes made to the file content. The editor view might close, or there might be a confirmation message. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the checkmark icon at `[903, 56]` (bottom left) was unsuccessful in saving the file. Instead of saving, the action prepended the markdown syntax for a checkbox, \"- [ ] \", to the existing text. The text changed from \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" to \"- [ ] inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\". This outcome moves the agent further from completing the subgoal of updating the file content as intended. The immediate next steps must involve correcting the text and then identifying and using the correct save mechanism.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 7: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field. The text field currently contains \"- [ ] inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\\\\n\". After this action, the text field is expected to be empty. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen (e.g., file browser or welcome screen) is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[145,247],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the text \"pZwh1hZwvmPj5inNqu8U\" at approximately `[145, 247]` to select it. This is predicted to highlight the text and show options like \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Paste\\', or \\'Select All\\'. Actual Outcome: The long press action successfully selected the text \"pZwh1hZwvmPj5inNqu8U\" and displayed a context menu with options like \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Paste\\'. This brings the agent closer to updating the file content by allowing manipulation of the existing text.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[98,384],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Cut\" option in the context menu, located at approximately [98, 384]. This will remove the currently selected text \"pZwh1hZwvmPj5inNqu8U\" from the editor. The text field should then be empty, ready for new input. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \"Cut\" option was successful. The selected text \"pZwh1hZwvmPj5inNqu8U\" was removed from the editor. The text field is now empty and ready for the new content to be inputted. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of updating the file content.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" into the currently focused text editor. The editor is currently empty. After this action, the editor should contain the new text. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting text \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" was successful. The text editor now displays this text, as confirmed by the second screenshot and the XML data. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of updating the file content. The next step is to save these changes.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[903,56],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkmark icon at the bottom left of the screen, located at approximately `[903, 56]`. This action is predicted to save the changes made to the file content. The editor view might close, or there might be a confirmation message. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the checkmark icon at `[903, 56]` (bottom left) was unsuccessful in saving the file. Instead of saving, the action prepended the markdown syntax for a checkbox, \"- [ ] \", to the existing text. The text changed from \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" to \"- [ ] inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\". This outcome moves the agent further from completing the subgoal of updating the file content as intended. The immediate next steps must involve correcting the text and then identifying and using the correct save mechanism.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field. The text field currently contains \"- [ ] inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\\\\n\". After this action, the text field is expected to be empty. Actual Outcome: The action to delete all text from the currently focused text field was successful. The text \"- [ ] inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\\\\n\" was removed from the editor. The text field is now empty, as shown in the second screenshot and confirmed by the XML data where the \\'text\\' attribute is \"\\\\n\". This action corrected the error from the previous step and allows the agent to proceed with inputting the correct content.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 42, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.39\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \\'{\\\\\\'box_2d\\\\\\': [71, 31, 103, 383], \\\\\\'text\\\\\\': \\\\\\'strong_jacket _\"\\\\\\'}\\', \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 727, 96, 889], \\'text\\': \\'0 Q\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [891, 147, 914, 335], \\'text\\': \\'= :=\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 653], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 908, 100, 985]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 834, 927, 931]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 594, 934, 700]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 243, 928, 344]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [879, 950, 925, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 823, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 717, 100, 798]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 481, 937, 578]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 362, 936, 462]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 813, 101, 895]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 522, 97, 602]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 620, 99, 700]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 126, 927, 228]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 718, 927, 815]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 905, 37, 943]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 196, 37, 239]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 8, 926, 104]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 139, 37, 188]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 432, 97, 496]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"0\", text=\"\\n\", resource-id=\"net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"net.gsantner.markor\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[0,275][1080,2102]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"\\n\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[145,247],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the text \"pZwh1hZwvmPj5inNqu8U\" at approximately `[145, 247]` to select it. This is predicted to highlight the text and show options like \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Paste\\', or \\'Select All\\'. Actual Outcome: The long press action successfully selected the text \"pZwh1hZwvmPj5inNqu8U\" and displayed a context menu with options like \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Paste\\'. This brings the agent closer to updating the file content by allowing manipulation of the existing text.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[98,384],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Cut\" option in the context menu, located at approximately [98, 384]. This will remove the currently selected text \"pZwh1hZwvmPj5inNqu8U\" from the editor. The text field should then be empty, ready for new input. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \"Cut\" option was successful. The selected text \"pZwh1hZwvmPj5inNqu8U\" was removed from the editor. The text field is now empty and ready for the new content to be inputted. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of updating the file content.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" into the currently focused text editor. The editor is currently empty. After this action, the editor should contain the new text. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting text \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" was successful. The text editor now displays this text, as confirmed by the second screenshot and the XML data. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of updating the file content. The next step is to save these changes.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[903,56],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkmark icon at the bottom left of the screen, located at approximately `[903, 56]`. This action is predicted to save the changes made to the file content. The editor view might close, or there might be a confirmation message. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the checkmark icon at `[903, 56]` (bottom left) was unsuccessful in saving the file. Instead of saving, the action prepended the markdown syntax for a checkbox, \"- [ ] \", to the existing text. The text changed from \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" to \"- [ ] inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\". This outcome moves the agent further from completing the subgoal of updating the file content as intended. The immediate next steps must involve correcting the text and then identifying and using the correct save mechanism.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field. The text field currently contains \"- [ ] inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\\\\n\". After this action, the text field is expected to be empty. Actual Outcome: The action to delete all text from the currently focused text field was successful. The text \"- [ ] inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\\\\n\" was removed from the editor. The text field is now empty, as shown in the second screenshot and confirmed by the XML data where the \\'text\\' attribute is \"\\\\n\". This action corrected the error from the previous step and allows the agent to proceed with inputting the correct content.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 8: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" into the currently focused text editor. The editor is currently empty. After this action, the editor should contain the new text. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen (e.g., file browser or welcome screen) is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[98,384],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Cut\" option in the context menu, located at approximately [98, 384]. This will remove the currently selected text \"pZwh1hZwvmPj5inNqu8U\" from the editor. The text field should then be empty, ready for new input. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \"Cut\" option was successful. The selected text \"pZwh1hZwvmPj5inNqu8U\" was removed from the editor. The text field is now empty and ready for the new content to be inputted. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of updating the file content.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" into the currently focused text editor. The editor is currently empty. After this action, the editor should contain the new text. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting text \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" was successful. The text editor now displays this text, as confirmed by the second screenshot and the XML data. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of updating the file content. The next step is to save these changes.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[903,56],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkmark icon at the bottom left of the screen, located at approximately `[903, 56]`. This action is predicted to save the changes made to the file content. The editor view might close, or there might be a confirmation message. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the checkmark icon at `[903, 56]` (bottom left) was unsuccessful in saving the file. Instead of saving, the action prepended the markdown syntax for a checkbox, \"- [ ] \", to the existing text. The text changed from \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" to \"- [ ] inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\". This outcome moves the agent further from completing the subgoal of updating the file content as intended. The immediate next steps must involve correcting the text and then identifying and using the correct save mechanism.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field. The text field currently contains \"- [ ] inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\\\\n\". After this action, the text field is expected to be empty. Actual Outcome: The action to delete all text from the currently focused text field was successful. The text \"- [ ] inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\\\\n\" was removed from the editor. The text field is now empty, as shown in the second screenshot and confirmed by the XML data where the \\'text\\' attribute is \"\\\\n\". This action corrected the error from the previous step and allows the agent to proceed with inputting the correct content.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" into the currently focused text editor. The editor is currently empty. After this action, the editor should contain the new text. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" into the focused text field was successful. The editor now contains the desired text. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of updating the file content. The next step is to save these changes.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 42, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.40\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \\'{\\\\\\'box_2d\\\\\\': [71, 31, 103, 383], \\\\\\'text\\\\\\': \\\\\\'strong_jacket _\"\\\\\\'}\\', \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 727, 96, 889], \\'text\\': \\'0 Q\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [133, 34, 155, 464], \\'text\\': \\'inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7l\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [891, 147, 914, 335], \\'text\\': \\'= :=\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 653], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 909, 100, 984]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 835, 926, 930]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 620, 99, 700]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 822, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 594, 935, 700]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 813, 102, 894]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 717, 100, 797]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 244, 928, 343]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 952, 924, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 483, 939, 576]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 519, 97, 604]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 362, 939, 462]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 127, 926, 225]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 10, 924, 102]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 37, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 721, 925, 813]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 141, 37, 188]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 905, 37, 943]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 424, 112, 509]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"0\", text=\"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\\n\", resource-id=\"net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"net.gsantner.markor\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[0,275][1080,2102]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\\n\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[98,384],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Cut\" option in the context menu, located at approximately [98, 384]. This will remove the currently selected text \"pZwh1hZwvmPj5inNqu8U\" from the editor. The text field should then be empty, ready for new input. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \"Cut\" option was successful. The selected text \"pZwh1hZwvmPj5inNqu8U\" was removed from the editor. The text field is now empty and ready for the new content to be inputted. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of updating the file content.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" into the currently focused text editor. The editor is currently empty. After this action, the editor should contain the new text. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting text \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" was successful. The text editor now displays this text, as confirmed by the second screenshot and the XML data. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of updating the file content. The next step is to save these changes.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[903,56],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkmark icon at the bottom left of the screen, located at approximately `[903, 56]`. This action is predicted to save the changes made to the file content. The editor view might close, or there might be a confirmation message. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the checkmark icon at `[903, 56]` (bottom left) was unsuccessful in saving the file. Instead of saving, the action prepended the markdown syntax for a checkbox, \"- [ ] \", to the existing text. The text changed from \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" to \"- [ ] inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\". This outcome moves the agent further from completing the subgoal of updating the file content as intended. The immediate next steps must involve correcting the text and then identifying and using the correct save mechanism.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field. The text field currently contains \"- [ ] inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\\\\n\". After this action, the text field is expected to be empty. Actual Outcome: The action to delete all text from the currently focused text field was successful. The text \"- [ ] inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\\\\n\" was removed from the editor. The text field is now empty, as shown in the second screenshot and confirmed by the XML data where the \\'text\\' attribute is \"\\\\n\". This action corrected the error from the previous step and allows the agent to proceed with inputting the correct content.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" into the currently focused text editor. The editor is currently empty. After this action, the editor should contain the new text. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" into the focused text field was successful. The editor now contains the desired text. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of updating the file content. The next step is to save these changes.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 9: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the save icon (floppy disk) located at the top right of the screen, at approximately [83, 757]. This action is intended to save the current content of the file. The editor view might remain open, or it might close, or a confirmation message might appear. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen (e.g., file browser or welcome screen) is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The editor is currently empty. After this action, the editor should contain the new text. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting text \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" was successful. The text editor now displays this text, as confirmed by the second screenshot and the XML data. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of updating the file content. The next step is to save these changes.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[903,56],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkmark icon at the bottom left of the screen, located at approximately `[903, 56]`. This action is predicted to save the changes made to the file content. The editor view might close, or there might be a confirmation message. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the checkmark icon at `[903, 56]` (bottom left) was unsuccessful in saving the file. Instead of saving, the action prepended the markdown syntax for a checkbox, \"- [ ] \", to the existing text. The text changed from \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" to \"- [ ] inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\". This outcome moves the agent further from completing the subgoal of updating the file content as intended. The immediate next steps must involve correcting the text and then identifying and using the correct save mechanism.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field. The text field currently contains \"- [ ] inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\\\\n\". After this action, the text field is expected to be empty. Actual Outcome: The action to delete all text from the currently focused text field was successful. The text \"- [ ] inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\\\\n\" was removed from the editor. The text field is now empty, as shown in the second screenshot and confirmed by the XML data where the \\'text\\' attribute is \"\\\\n\". This action corrected the error from the previous step and allows the agent to proceed with inputting the correct content.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" into the currently focused text editor. The editor is currently empty. After this action, the editor should contain the new text. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" into the focused text field was successful. The editor now contains the desired text. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of updating the file content. The next step is to save these changes.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the save icon (floppy disk) located at the top right of the screen, at approximately [83, 757]. This action is intended to save the current content of the file. The editor view might remain open, or it might close, or a confirmation message might appear. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the save icon (floppy disk) at approximately [83, 757] was performed. There was no immediate visual feedback on the screen, such as a confirmation message or the editor closing. The text content \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" remains visible in the editor. Assuming the save operation was successful in the background, this action has brought the agent to the completion of the content update part of the user instruction. The file content is now considered saved.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 42, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.40\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \\'{\\\\\\'box_2d\\\\\\': [71, 31, 103, 383], \\\\\\'text\\\\\\': \\\\\\'strong_jacket _\"\\\\\\'}\\', \"{\\'box_2d\\': [134, 33, 156, 459], \\'text\\': \\'inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [890, 143, 915, 336], \\'text\\': \\'= ,\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 653], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 908, 100, 984]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 835, 926, 930]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 619, 99, 701]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 823, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 594, 936, 700]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 521, 97, 606]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 244, 928, 343]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 952, 924, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 812, 102, 896]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 483, 940, 576]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 717, 99, 797]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 362, 940, 462]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 127, 926, 225]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 10, 925, 102]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 720, 925, 813]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 195, 37, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 905, 36, 943]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 141, 37, 189]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 424, 112, 510]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"0\", text=\"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\\n\", resource-id=\"net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"net.gsantner.markor\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[0,275][1080,2102]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\\n\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The editor is currently empty. After this action, the editor should contain the new text. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting text \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" was successful. The text editor now displays this text, as confirmed by the second screenshot and the XML data. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of updating the file content. The next step is to save these changes.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[903,56],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkmark icon at the bottom left of the screen, located at approximately `[903, 56]`. This action is predicted to save the changes made to the file content. The editor view might close, or there might be a confirmation message. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the checkmark icon at `[903, 56]` (bottom left) was unsuccessful in saving the file. Instead of saving, the action prepended the markdown syntax for a checkbox, \"- [ ] \", to the existing text. The text changed from \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" to \"- [ ] inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\". This outcome moves the agent further from completing the subgoal of updating the file content as intended. The immediate next steps must involve correcting the text and then identifying and using the correct save mechanism.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field. The text field currently contains \"- [ ] inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\\\\n\". After this action, the text field is expected to be empty. Actual Outcome: The action to delete all text from the currently focused text field was successful. The text \"- [ ] inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\\\\n\" was removed from the editor. The text field is now empty, as shown in the second screenshot and confirmed by the XML data where the \\'text\\' attribute is \"\\\\n\". This action corrected the error from the previous step and allows the agent to proceed with inputting the correct content.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" into the currently focused text editor. The editor is currently empty. After this action, the editor should contain the new text. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" into the focused text field was successful. The editor now contains the desired text. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of updating the file content. The next step is to save these changes.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the save icon (floppy disk) located at the top right of the screen, at approximately [83, 757]. This action is intended to save the current content of the file. The editor view might remain open, or it might close, or a confirmation message might appear. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the save icon (floppy disk) at approximately [83, 757] was performed. There was no immediate visual feedback on the screen, such as a confirmation message or the editor closing. The text content \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" remains visible in the editor. Assuming the save operation was successful in the background, this action has brought the agent to the completion of the content update part of the user instruction. The file content is now considered saved.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 10: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen, at approximately `[83, 946]`. This action is expected to open a menu containing options for the current file, hopefully including a \\'Rename\\' option. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen (e.g., file browser or welcome screen) is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[903,56],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkmark icon at the bottom left of the screen, located at approximately `[903, 56]`. This action is predicted to save the changes made to the file content. The editor view might close, or there might be a confirmation message. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the checkmark icon at `[903, 56]` (bottom left) was unsuccessful in saving the file. Instead of saving, the action prepended the markdown syntax for a checkbox, \"- [ ] \", to the existing text. The text changed from \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" to \"- [ ] inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\". This outcome moves the agent further from completing the subgoal of updating the file content as intended. The immediate next steps must involve correcting the text and then identifying and using the correct save mechanism.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field. The text field currently contains \"- [ ] inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\\\\n\". After this action, the text field is expected to be empty. Actual Outcome: The action to delete all text from the currently focused text field was successful. The text \"- [ ] inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\\\\n\" was removed from the editor. The text field is now empty, as shown in the second screenshot and confirmed by the XML data where the \\'text\\' attribute is \"\\\\n\". This action corrected the error from the previous step and allows the agent to proceed with inputting the correct content.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" into the currently focused text editor. The editor is currently empty. After this action, the editor should contain the new text. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" into the focused text field was successful. The editor now contains the desired text. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of updating the file content. The next step is to save these changes.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the save icon (floppy disk) located at the top right of the screen, at approximately [83, 757]. This action is intended to save the current content of the file. The editor view might remain open, or it might close, or a confirmation message might appear. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the save icon (floppy disk) at approximately [83, 757] was performed. There was no immediate visual feedback on the screen, such as a confirmation message or the editor closing. The text content \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" remains visible in the editor. Assuming the save operation was successful in the background, this action has brought the agent to the completion of the content update part of the user instruction. The file content is now considered saved.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen, at approximately `[83, 946]`. This action is expected to open a menu containing options for the current file, hopefully including a \\'Rename\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dots menu icon at `[83, 946]` was successful. A menu popped up on the right side of the screen, displaying options: \"File settings\", \"Share\", \"Tools\", \"Info\", and \"Reload\". This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of renaming the file, as the rename option is likely within this menu or a subsequent screen accessed through it.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 41, 36, 133], \\'text\\': \\'15.41\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 31, 103, 370], \\'text\\': \\'strong_jacket _.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [75, 606, 96, 825], \\'text\\': \\'File settings\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [133, 34, 155, 464], \\'text\\': \\'inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7l\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [127, 606, 146, 716], \\'text\\': \\'Share\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [176, 529, 202, 712], \\'text\\': \\'ff Tools\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [232, 606, 251, 683], \\'text\\': \\'Info\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [284, 607, 303, 734], \\'text\\': \\'Reload\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [890, 143, 915, 336], \\'text\\': \\'= ,\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 653], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [268, 510, 321, 997]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [110, 510, 164, 996]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [164, 508, 218, 997]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [215, 512, 269, 998]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [65, 512, 111, 998]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 833, 923, 934]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 592, 924, 703]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 358, 945, 468]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [883, 715, 922, 814]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 949, 922, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 240, 928, 345]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 125, 924, 229]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 823, 35, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [883, 483, 921, 579]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 8, 924, 106]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 905, 35, 942]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 36, 241]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 138, 36, 191]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[903,56],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkmark icon at the bottom left of the screen, located at approximately `[903, 56]`. This action is predicted to save the changes made to the file content. The editor view might close, or there might be a confirmation message. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the checkmark icon at `[903, 56]` (bottom left) was unsuccessful in saving the file. Instead of saving, the action prepended the markdown syntax for a checkbox, \"- [ ] \", to the existing text. The text changed from \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" to \"- [ ] inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\". This outcome moves the agent further from completing the subgoal of updating the file content as intended. The immediate next steps must involve correcting the text and then identifying and using the correct save mechanism.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field. The text field currently contains \"- [ ] inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\\\\n\". After this action, the text field is expected to be empty. Actual Outcome: The action to delete all text from the currently focused text field was successful. The text \"- [ ] inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\\\\n\" was removed from the editor. The text field is now empty, as shown in the second screenshot and confirmed by the XML data where the \\'text\\' attribute is \"\\\\n\". This action corrected the error from the previous step and allows the agent to proceed with inputting the correct content.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" into the currently focused text editor. The editor is currently empty. After this action, the editor should contain the new text. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" into the focused text field was successful. The editor now contains the desired text. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of updating the file content. The next step is to save these changes.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the save icon (floppy disk) located at the top right of the screen, at approximately [83, 757]. This action is intended to save the current content of the file. The editor view might remain open, or it might close, or a confirmation message might appear. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the save icon (floppy disk) at approximately [83, 757] was performed. There was no immediate visual feedback on the screen, such as a confirmation message or the editor closing. The text content \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" remains visible in the editor. Assuming the save operation was successful in the background, this action has brought the agent to the completion of the content update part of the user instruction. The file content is now considered saved.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen, at approximately `[83, 946]`. This action is expected to open a menu containing options for the current file, hopefully including a \\'Rename\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dots menu icon at `[83, 946]` was successful. A menu popped up on the right side of the screen, displaying options: \"File settings\", \"Share\", \"Tools\", \"Info\", and \"Reload\". This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of renaming the file, as the rename option is likely within this menu or a subsequent screen accessed through it.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 11: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,715],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \"File settings\" in the menu. The menu is currently open on the right side of the screen. \"File settings\" is the first option in the menu. This action is expected to open a new screen or dialog related to file settings, where a rename option might be found. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen (e.g., file browser or welcome screen) is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field. The text field currently contains \"- [ ] inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\\\\n\". After this action, the text field is expected to be empty. Actual Outcome: The action to delete all text from the currently focused text field was successful. The text \"- [ ] inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\\\\n\" was removed from the editor. The text field is now empty, as shown in the second screenshot and confirmed by the XML data where the \\'text\\' attribute is \"\\\\n\". This action corrected the error from the previous step and allows the agent to proceed with inputting the correct content.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" into the currently focused text editor. The editor is currently empty. After this action, the editor should contain the new text. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" into the focused text field was successful. The editor now contains the desired text. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of updating the file content. The next step is to save these changes.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the save icon (floppy disk) located at the top right of the screen, at approximately [83, 757]. This action is intended to save the current content of the file. The editor view might remain open, or it might close, or a confirmation message might appear. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the save icon (floppy disk) at approximately [83, 757] was performed. There was no immediate visual feedback on the screen, such as a confirmation message or the editor closing. The text content \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" remains visible in the editor. Assuming the save operation was successful in the background, this action has brought the agent to the completion of the content update part of the user instruction. The file content is now considered saved.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen, at approximately `[83, 946]`. This action is expected to open a menu containing options for the current file, hopefully including a \\'Rename\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dots menu icon at `[83, 946]` was successful. A menu popped up on the right side of the screen, displaying options: \"File settings\", \"Share\", \"Tools\", \"Info\", and \"Reload\". This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of renaming the file, as the rename option is likely within this menu or a subsequent screen accessed through it.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,715],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \"File settings\" in the menu. The menu is currently open on the right side of the screen. \"File settings\" is the first option in the menu. This action is expected to open a new screen or dialog related to file settings, where a rename option might be found. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \"File settings\" at `[85, 715]` was successful. A new menu appeared on the right side of the screen, titled \"File settings\". This menu displays the options: \"Wrap words\", \"Syntax highlighting\", \"Auto-format\", \"Font Size\", and \"Format\". This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of renaming the file by navigating deeper into the settings menu where the rename option might be located.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 42, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.42\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 65, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 31, 103, 368], \\'text\\': \\'strong_jacket_\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [73, 488, 97, 690], \\'text\\': \\'File settings\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [135, 34, 155, 459], \\'text\\': \\'inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [127, 552, 149, 766], \\'text\\': \\'Wrap words\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [179, 550, 203, 889], \\'text\\': \\'Syntax highlighting\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [232, 552, 251, 772], \\'text\\': \\'Auto-format\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [283, 482, 305, 721], \\'text\\': \\'TT Font Size\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [331, 471, 360, 686], \\'text\\': \\'fi Format\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [890, 143, 915, 336], \\'text\\': \\'= ,\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 653], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [164, 446, 216, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [216, 451, 269, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [268, 451, 321, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [110, 453, 164, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 833, 923, 934]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 592, 925, 703]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 359, 944, 468]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 949, 923, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [883, 718, 923, 814]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 240, 930, 346]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 126, 923, 229]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 484, 928, 579]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 822, 36, 900]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 8, 924, 106]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 906, 35, 941]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 457, 111, 996]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 196, 36, 240]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused text field. The text field currently contains \"- [ ] inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\\\\n\". After this action, the text field is expected to be empty. Actual Outcome: The action to delete all text from the currently focused text field was successful. The text \"- [ ] inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\\\\n\" was removed from the editor. The text field is now empty, as shown in the second screenshot and confirmed by the XML data where the \\'text\\' attribute is \"\\\\n\". This action corrected the error from the previous step and allows the agent to proceed with inputting the correct content.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" into the currently focused text editor. The editor is currently empty. After this action, the editor should contain the new text. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" into the focused text field was successful. The editor now contains the desired text. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of updating the file content. The next step is to save these changes.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the save icon (floppy disk) located at the top right of the screen, at approximately [83, 757]. This action is intended to save the current content of the file. The editor view might remain open, or it might close, or a confirmation message might appear. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the save icon (floppy disk) at approximately [83, 757] was performed. There was no immediate visual feedback on the screen, such as a confirmation message or the editor closing. The text content \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" remains visible in the editor. Assuming the save operation was successful in the background, this action has brought the agent to the completion of the content update part of the user instruction. The file content is now considered saved.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen, at approximately `[83, 946]`. This action is expected to open a menu containing options for the current file, hopefully including a \\'Rename\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dots menu icon at `[83, 946]` was successful. A menu popped up on the right side of the screen, displaying options: \"File settings\", \"Share\", \"Tools\", \"Info\", and \"Reload\". This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of renaming the file, as the rename option is likely within this menu or a subsequent screen accessed through it.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,715],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \"File settings\" in the menu. The menu is currently open on the right side of the screen. \"File settings\" is the first option in the menu. This action is expected to open a new screen or dialog related to file settings, where a rename option might be found. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \"File settings\" at `[85, 715]` was successful. A new menu appeared on the right side of the screen, titled \"File settings\". This menu displays the options: \"Wrap words\", \"Syntax highlighting\", \"Auto-format\", \"Font Size\", and \"Format\". This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of renaming the file by navigating deeper into the settings menu where the rename option might be located.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 12: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,578],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Format\" option in the \"File settings\" menu. \"Format\" is the last option in the currently visible menu and has an arrow icon, indicating it will open a submenu. This action is taken to find the \"Rename\" option for the file. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen (e.g., file browser or welcome screen) is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The editor is currently empty. After this action, the editor should contain the new text. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" into the focused text field was successful. The editor now contains the desired text. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of updating the file content. The next step is to save these changes.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the save icon (floppy disk) located at the top right of the screen, at approximately [83, 757]. This action is intended to save the current content of the file. The editor view might remain open, or it might close, or a confirmation message might appear. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the save icon (floppy disk) at approximately [83, 757] was performed. There was no immediate visual feedback on the screen, such as a confirmation message or the editor closing. The text content \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" remains visible in the editor. Assuming the save operation was successful in the background, this action has brought the agent to the completion of the content update part of the user instruction. The file content is now considered saved.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen, at approximately `[83, 946]`. This action is expected to open a menu containing options for the current file, hopefully including a \\'Rename\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dots menu icon at `[83, 946]` was successful. A menu popped up on the right side of the screen, displaying options: \"File settings\", \"Share\", \"Tools\", \"Info\", and \"Reload\". This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of renaming the file, as the rename option is likely within this menu or a subsequent screen accessed through it.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,715],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \"File settings\" in the menu. The menu is currently open on the right side of the screen. \"File settings\" is the first option in the menu. This action is expected to open a new screen or dialog related to file settings, where a rename option might be found. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \"File settings\" at `[85, 715]` was successful. A new menu appeared on the right side of the screen, titled \"File settings\". This menu displays the options: \"Wrap words\", \"Syntax highlighting\", \"Auto-format\", \"Font Size\", and \"Format\". This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of renaming the file by navigating deeper into the settings menu where the rename option might be located.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,578],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Format\" option in the \"File settings\" menu. \"Format\" is the last option in the currently visible menu and has an arrow icon, indicating it will open a submenu. This action is taken to find the \"Rename\" option for the file. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \"Format\" at `[345, 578]` was successful in opening a new submenu titled \"Format\". This submenu displays options for different file formats (e.g., \"Key - Value\", \"Plain Text\"). However, this submenu does not contain a \"Rename\" option, which is needed to complete the current subgoal. Therefore, while the action itself was executed correctly, it did not lead directly to the desired outcome of finding the rename functionality. The agent needs to backtrack.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 42, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.42\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 31, 103, 370], \\'text\\': \\'strong_jacket _.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [77, 561, 92, 676], \\'text\\': \\'Format\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [133, 34, 155, 464], \\'text\\': \\'inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7l\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [127, 613, 149, 814], \\'text\\': \\'Key Value\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [179, 617, 199, 797], \\'text\\': \\'Plain Text\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [233, 619, 250, 777], \\'text\\': \\'AsciiDoc\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [285, 544, 304, 809], \\'text\\': \\'MI Markdown\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [336, 613, 356, 761], \\'text\\': \\'todo.txt\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [390, 617, 409, 764], \\'text\\': \\'Wikitext\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [443, 616, 460, 697], \\'text\\': \\'CSV\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [494, 617, 517, 862], \\'text\\': \\'Embed binary\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [890, 143, 915, 336], \\'text\\': \\'= ,\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 653], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [479, 518, 531, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [269, 518, 321, 980]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [164, 517, 216, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [215, 517, 270, 985]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [425, 512, 480, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [110, 520, 164, 990]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 519, 110, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 831, 923, 935]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 591, 926, 704]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 358, 944, 469]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [883, 716, 922, 814]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 949, 922, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 125, 924, 230]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 239, 928, 346]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 483, 930, 579]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 7, 923, 108]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 820, 36, 902]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 196, 37, 241]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 904, 36, 946]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 140, 36, 190]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The editor is currently empty. After this action, the editor should contain the new text. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" into the focused text field was successful. The editor now contains the desired text. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of updating the file content. The next step is to save these changes.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the save icon (floppy disk) located at the top right of the screen, at approximately [83, 757]. This action is intended to save the current content of the file. The editor view might remain open, or it might close, or a confirmation message might appear. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the save icon (floppy disk) at approximately [83, 757] was performed. There was no immediate visual feedback on the screen, such as a confirmation message or the editor closing. The text content \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" remains visible in the editor. Assuming the save operation was successful in the background, this action has brought the agent to the completion of the content update part of the user instruction. The file content is now considered saved.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen, at approximately `[83, 946]`. This action is expected to open a menu containing options for the current file, hopefully including a \\'Rename\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dots menu icon at `[83, 946]` was successful. A menu popped up on the right side of the screen, displaying options: \"File settings\", \"Share\", \"Tools\", \"Info\", and \"Reload\". This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of renaming the file, as the rename option is likely within this menu or a subsequent screen accessed through it.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,715],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \"File settings\" in the menu. The menu is currently open on the right side of the screen. \"File settings\" is the first option in the menu. This action is expected to open a new screen or dialog related to file settings, where a rename option might be found. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \"File settings\" at `[85, 715]` was successful. A new menu appeared on the right side of the screen, titled \"File settings\". This menu displays the options: \"Wrap words\", \"Syntax highlighting\", \"Auto-format\", \"Font Size\", and \"Format\". This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of renaming the file by navigating deeper into the settings menu where the rename option might be located.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,578],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Format\" option in the \"File settings\" menu. \"Format\" is the last option in the currently visible menu and has an arrow icon, indicating it will open a submenu. This action is taken to find the \"Rename\" option for the file. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \"Format\" at `[345, 578]` was successful in opening a new submenu titled \"Format\". This submenu displays options for different file formats (e.g., \"Key - Value\", \"Plain Text\"). However, this submenu does not contain a \"Rename\" option, which is needed to complete the current subgoal. Therefore, while the action itself was executed correctly, it did not lead directly to the desired outcome of finding the rename functionality. The agent needs to backtrack.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 13: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the \\'Back\\' button (keyevent 4) to close the current \\'Format\\' submenu. This should return the agent to the \\'File settings\\' menu. The \\'Format\\' submenu is currently open on the right side of the screen. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen (e.g., file browser or welcome screen) is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the save icon (floppy disk) located at the top right of the screen, at approximately [83, 757]. This action is intended to save the current content of the file. The editor view might remain open, or it might close, or a confirmation message might appear. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the save icon (floppy disk) at approximately [83, 757] was performed. There was no immediate visual feedback on the screen, such as a confirmation message or the editor closing. The text content \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" remains visible in the editor. Assuming the save operation was successful in the background, this action has brought the agent to the completion of the content update part of the user instruction. The file content is now considered saved.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen, at approximately `[83, 946]`. This action is expected to open a menu containing options for the current file, hopefully including a \\'Rename\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dots menu icon at `[83, 946]` was successful. A menu popped up on the right side of the screen, displaying options: \"File settings\", \"Share\", \"Tools\", \"Info\", and \"Reload\". This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of renaming the file, as the rename option is likely within this menu or a subsequent screen accessed through it.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,715],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \"File settings\" in the menu. The menu is currently open on the right side of the screen. \"File settings\" is the first option in the menu. This action is expected to open a new screen or dialog related to file settings, where a rename option might be found. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \"File settings\" at `[85, 715]` was successful. A new menu appeared on the right side of the screen, titled \"File settings\". This menu displays the options: \"Wrap words\", \"Syntax highlighting\", \"Auto-format\", \"Font Size\", and \"Format\". This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of renaming the file by navigating deeper into the settings menu where the rename option might be located.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,578],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Format\" option in the \"File settings\" menu. \"Format\" is the last option in the currently visible menu and has an arrow icon, indicating it will open a submenu. This action is taken to find the \"Rename\" option for the file. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \"Format\" at `[345, 578]` was successful in opening a new submenu titled \"Format\". This submenu displays options for different file formats (e.g., \"Key - Value\", \"Plain Text\"). However, this submenu does not contain a \"Rename\" option, which is needed to complete the current subgoal. Therefore, while the action itself was executed correctly, it did not lead directly to the desired outcome of finding the rename functionality. The agent needs to backtrack.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the \\'Back\\' button (keyevent 4) to close the current \\'Format\\' submenu. This should return the agent to the \\'File settings\\' menu. The \\'Format\\' submenu is currently open on the right side of the screen. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the \"Format\" submenu. However, it also unexpectedly closed the parent \"File settings\" menu, returning the agent to the main editor view instead of the \"File settings\" menu. This outcome means the agent needs to re-open the main menu (three-dots icon) to continue searching for the rename option. The action was executed, but the state change requires an adjustment to the planned next steps.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 42, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.43\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \\'{\\\\\\'box_2d\\\\\\': [71, 31, 103, 383], \\\\\\'text\\\\\\': \\\\\\'strong_jacket _\"\\\\\\'}\\', \"{\\'box_2d\\': [134, 33, 156, 459], \\'text\\': \\'inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [890, 143, 915, 336], \\'text\\': \\'= ,\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 653], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 908, 100, 984]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 619, 99, 701]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 835, 926, 930]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 520, 97, 606]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 823, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 594, 935, 700]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 244, 928, 343]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 952, 924, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 812, 102, 896]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 483, 939, 576]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 716, 100, 798]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 362, 939, 461]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 128, 926, 225]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 141, 36, 189]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 10, 924, 102]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 37, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 721, 925, 813]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 905, 36, 943]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 424, 111, 510]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"0\", text=\"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\\n\", resource-id=\"net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"net.gsantner.markor\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[0,275][1080,2102]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\\n\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the save icon (floppy disk) located at the top right of the screen, at approximately [83, 757]. This action is intended to save the current content of the file. The editor view might remain open, or it might close, or a confirmation message might appear. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the save icon (floppy disk) at approximately [83, 757] was performed. There was no immediate visual feedback on the screen, such as a confirmation message or the editor closing. The text content \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" remains visible in the editor. Assuming the save operation was successful in the background, this action has brought the agent to the completion of the content update part of the user instruction. The file content is now considered saved.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen, at approximately `[83, 946]`. This action is expected to open a menu containing options for the current file, hopefully including a \\'Rename\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dots menu icon at `[83, 946]` was successful. A menu popped up on the right side of the screen, displaying options: \"File settings\", \"Share\", \"Tools\", \"Info\", and \"Reload\". This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of renaming the file, as the rename option is likely within this menu or a subsequent screen accessed through it.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,715],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \"File settings\" in the menu. The menu is currently open on the right side of the screen. \"File settings\" is the first option in the menu. This action is expected to open a new screen or dialog related to file settings, where a rename option might be found. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \"File settings\" at `[85, 715]` was successful. A new menu appeared on the right side of the screen, titled \"File settings\". This menu displays the options: \"Wrap words\", \"Syntax highlighting\", \"Auto-format\", \"Font Size\", and \"Format\". This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of renaming the file by navigating deeper into the settings menu where the rename option might be located.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,578],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Format\" option in the \"File settings\" menu. \"Format\" is the last option in the currently visible menu and has an arrow icon, indicating it will open a submenu. This action is taken to find the \"Rename\" option for the file. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \"Format\" at `[345, 578]` was successful in opening a new submenu titled \"Format\". This submenu displays options for different file formats (e.g., \"Key - Value\", \"Plain Text\"). However, this submenu does not contain a \"Rename\" option, which is needed to complete the current subgoal. Therefore, while the action itself was executed correctly, it did not lead directly to the desired outcome of finding the rename functionality. The agent needs to backtrack.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the \\'Back\\' button (keyevent 4) to close the current \\'Format\\' submenu. This should return the agent to the \\'File settings\\' menu. The \\'Format\\' submenu is currently open on the right side of the screen. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the \"Format\" submenu. However, it also unexpectedly closed the parent \"File settings\" menu, returning the agent to the main editor view instead of the \"File settings\" menu. This outcome means the agent needs to re-open the main menu (three-dots icon) to continue searching for the rename option. The action was executed, but the state change requires an adjustment to the planned next steps.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 14: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen, at approximately `[83, 946]`. This action is expected to open a menu containing options for the current file, where the \\'Rename\\' option might be found directly or under a submenu like \\'Tools\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen (e.g., file browser or welcome screen) is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen, at approximately `[83, 946]`. This action is expected to open a menu containing options for the current file, hopefully including a \\'Rename\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dots menu icon at `[83, 946]` was successful. A menu popped up on the right side of the screen, displaying options: \"File settings\", \"Share\", \"Tools\", \"Info\", and \"Reload\". This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of renaming the file, as the rename option is likely within this menu or a subsequent screen accessed through it.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,715],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \"File settings\" in the menu. The menu is currently open on the right side of the screen. \"File settings\" is the first option in the menu. This action is expected to open a new screen or dialog related to file settings, where a rename option might be found. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \"File settings\" at `[85, 715]` was successful. A new menu appeared on the right side of the screen, titled \"File settings\". This menu displays the options: \"Wrap words\", \"Syntax highlighting\", \"Auto-format\", \"Font Size\", and \"Format\". This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of renaming the file by navigating deeper into the settings menu where the rename option might be located.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,578],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Format\" option in the \"File settings\" menu. \"Format\" is the last option in the currently visible menu and has an arrow icon, indicating it will open a submenu. This action is taken to find the \"Rename\" option for the file. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \"Format\" at `[345, 578]` was successful in opening a new submenu titled \"Format\". This submenu displays options for different file formats (e.g., \"Key - Value\", \"Plain Text\"). However, this submenu does not contain a \"Rename\" option, which is needed to complete the current subgoal. Therefore, while the action itself was executed correctly, it did not lead directly to the desired outcome of finding the rename functionality. The agent needs to backtrack.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the \\'Back\\' button (keyevent 4) to close the current \\'Format\\' submenu. This should return the agent to the \\'File settings\\' menu. The \\'Format\\' submenu is currently open on the right side of the screen. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the \"Format\" submenu. However, it also unexpectedly closed the parent \"File settings\" menu, returning the agent to the main editor view instead of the \"File settings\" menu. This outcome means the agent needs to re-open the main menu (three-dots icon) to continue searching for the rename option. The action was executed, but the state change requires an adjustment to the planned next steps.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen, at approximately `[83, 946]`. This action is expected to open a menu containing options for the current file, where the \\'Rename\\' option might be found directly or under a submenu like \\'Tools\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dots menu icon at `[83, 946]` was successful. A menu popped up on the right side of the screen, displaying the options: \"File settings\", \"Share\", \"Tools\", \"Info\", and \"Reload\". This action has brought the agent back to a state where it can continue searching for the rename option, which is necessary to complete the active subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 42, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.44\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 31, 103, 368], \\'text\\': \\'strong_jacket_\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [75, 606, 96, 825], \\'text\\': \\'File settings\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [127, 606, 146, 716], \\'text\\': \\'Share\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [134, 33, 156, 457], \\'text\\': \\'inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [176, 529, 202, 712], \\'text\\': \\'ff Tools\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [232, 606, 251, 683], \\'text\\': \\'Info\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [284, 607, 303, 734], \\'text\\': \\'Reload\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [890, 143, 915, 336], \\'text\\': \\'= ,\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 653], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [268, 510, 321, 997]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [110, 510, 164, 996]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [164, 508, 218, 997]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [215, 512, 269, 998]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [65, 512, 111, 997]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 833, 923, 934]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 592, 923, 703]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 358, 945, 468]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [883, 715, 922, 814]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 949, 922, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 240, 928, 345]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 125, 924, 229]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 824, 35, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [883, 483, 921, 579]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 9, 924, 108]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 905, 35, 941]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 37, 242]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen, at approximately `[83, 946]`. This action is expected to open a menu containing options for the current file, hopefully including a \\'Rename\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dots menu icon at `[83, 946]` was successful. A menu popped up on the right side of the screen, displaying options: \"File settings\", \"Share\", \"Tools\", \"Info\", and \"Reload\". This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of renaming the file, as the rename option is likely within this menu or a subsequent screen accessed through it.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,715],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \"File settings\" in the menu. The menu is currently open on the right side of the screen. \"File settings\" is the first option in the menu. This action is expected to open a new screen or dialog related to file settings, where a rename option might be found. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \"File settings\" at `[85, 715]` was successful. A new menu appeared on the right side of the screen, titled \"File settings\". This menu displays the options: \"Wrap words\", \"Syntax highlighting\", \"Auto-format\", \"Font Size\", and \"Format\". This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of renaming the file by navigating deeper into the settings menu where the rename option might be located.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,578],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Format\" option in the \"File settings\" menu. \"Format\" is the last option in the currently visible menu and has an arrow icon, indicating it will open a submenu. This action is taken to find the \"Rename\" option for the file. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \"Format\" at `[345, 578]` was successful in opening a new submenu titled \"Format\". This submenu displays options for different file formats (e.g., \"Key - Value\", \"Plain Text\"). However, this submenu does not contain a \"Rename\" option, which is needed to complete the current subgoal. Therefore, while the action itself was executed correctly, it did not lead directly to the desired outcome of finding the rename functionality. The agent needs to backtrack.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the \\'Back\\' button (keyevent 4) to close the current \\'Format\\' submenu. This should return the agent to the \\'File settings\\' menu. The \\'Format\\' submenu is currently open on the right side of the screen. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the \"Format\" submenu. However, it also unexpectedly closed the parent \"File settings\" menu, returning the agent to the main editor view instead of the \"File settings\" menu. This outcome means the agent needs to re-open the main menu (three-dots icon) to continue searching for the rename option. The action was executed, but the state change requires an adjustment to the planned next steps.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen, at approximately `[83, 946]`. This action is expected to open a menu containing options for the current file, where the \\'Rename\\' option might be found directly or under a submenu like \\'Tools\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dots menu icon at `[83, 946]` was successful. A menu popped up on the right side of the screen, displaying the options: \"File settings\", \"Share\", \"Tools\", \"Info\", and \"Reload\". This action has brought the agent back to a state where it can continue searching for the rename option, which is necessary to complete the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 15: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[189,620],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Tools\\' option in the currently open menu. The \\'Tools\\' option is located at approximately `[189, 620]`. This action is expected to open a submenu or a new screen containing tools for file management, hopefully including a \\'Rename\\' option. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen (e.g., file browser or welcome screen) is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,715],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \"File settings\" in the menu. The menu is currently open on the right side of the screen. \"File settings\" is the first option in the menu. This action is expected to open a new screen or dialog related to file settings, where a rename option might be found. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \"File settings\" at `[85, 715]` was successful. A new menu appeared on the right side of the screen, titled \"File settings\". This menu displays the options: \"Wrap words\", \"Syntax highlighting\", \"Auto-format\", \"Font Size\", and \"Format\". This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of renaming the file by navigating deeper into the settings menu where the rename option might be located.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,578],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Format\" option in the \"File settings\" menu. \"Format\" is the last option in the currently visible menu and has an arrow icon, indicating it will open a submenu. This action is taken to find the \"Rename\" option for the file. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \"Format\" at `[345, 578]` was successful in opening a new submenu titled \"Format\". This submenu displays options for different file formats (e.g., \"Key - Value\", \"Plain Text\"). However, this submenu does not contain a \"Rename\" option, which is needed to complete the current subgoal. Therefore, while the action itself was executed correctly, it did not lead directly to the desired outcome of finding the rename functionality. The agent needs to backtrack.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the \\'Back\\' button (keyevent 4) to close the current \\'Format\\' submenu. This should return the agent to the \\'File settings\\' menu. The \\'Format\\' submenu is currently open on the right side of the screen. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the \"Format\" submenu. However, it also unexpectedly closed the parent \"File settings\" menu, returning the agent to the main editor view instead of the \"File settings\" menu. This outcome means the agent needs to re-open the main menu (three-dots icon) to continue searching for the rename option. The action was executed, but the state change requires an adjustment to the planned next steps.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen, at approximately `[83, 946]`. This action is expected to open a menu containing options for the current file, where the \\'Rename\\' option might be found directly or under a submenu like \\'Tools\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dots menu icon at `[83, 946]` was successful. A menu popped up on the right side of the screen, displaying the options: \"File settings\", \"Share\", \"Tools\", \"Info\", and \"Reload\". This action has brought the agent back to a state where it can continue searching for the rename option, which is necessary to complete the active subgoal.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[189,620],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Tools\\' option in the currently open menu. The \\'Tools\\' option is located at approximately `[189, 620]`. This action is expected to open a submenu or a new screen containing tools for file management, hopefully including a \\'Rename\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Tools\\' at `[189, 620]` was successful in opening a submenu. A new submenu titled \"Tools\" appeared, displaying the option \"Speed Read\". However, this submenu does not contain the \"Rename\" option needed to complete the active subgoal. While the action itself was executed correctly (it opened the \\'Tools\\' submenu), it did not bring the agent closer to finding the rename functionality.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 42, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.44\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 31, 103, 370], \\'text\\': \\'strong_jacket _.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [77, 559, 92, 650], \\'text\\': \\'Tools\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [134, 33, 156, 459], \\'text\\': \\'inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [126, 613, 150, 830], \\'text\\': \\'Speed Read\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [890, 143, 915, 336], \\'text\\': \\'= ,\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 653], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [111, 517, 163, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 834, 925, 931]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 594, 929, 702]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 950, 923, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 243, 928, 343]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 823, 35, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 362, 943, 462]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 720, 924, 813]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 126, 925, 226]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 487, 931, 575]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 906, 35, 940]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 9, 925, 104]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 522, 110, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 37, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 142, 36, 189]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,715],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \"File settings\" in the menu. The menu is currently open on the right side of the screen. \"File settings\" is the first option in the menu. This action is expected to open a new screen or dialog related to file settings, where a rename option might be found. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \"File settings\" at `[85, 715]` was successful. A new menu appeared on the right side of the screen, titled \"File settings\". This menu displays the options: \"Wrap words\", \"Syntax highlighting\", \"Auto-format\", \"Font Size\", and \"Format\". This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of renaming the file by navigating deeper into the settings menu where the rename option might be located.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,578],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Format\" option in the \"File settings\" menu. \"Format\" is the last option in the currently visible menu and has an arrow icon, indicating it will open a submenu. This action is taken to find the \"Rename\" option for the file. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \"Format\" at `[345, 578]` was successful in opening a new submenu titled \"Format\". This submenu displays options for different file formats (e.g., \"Key - Value\", \"Plain Text\"). However, this submenu does not contain a \"Rename\" option, which is needed to complete the current subgoal. Therefore, while the action itself was executed correctly, it did not lead directly to the desired outcome of finding the rename functionality. The agent needs to backtrack.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the \\'Back\\' button (keyevent 4) to close the current \\'Format\\' submenu. This should return the agent to the \\'File settings\\' menu. The \\'Format\\' submenu is currently open on the right side of the screen. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the \"Format\" submenu. However, it also unexpectedly closed the parent \"File settings\" menu, returning the agent to the main editor view instead of the \"File settings\" menu. This outcome means the agent needs to re-open the main menu (three-dots icon) to continue searching for the rename option. The action was executed, but the state change requires an adjustment to the planned next steps.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen, at approximately `[83, 946]`. This action is expected to open a menu containing options for the current file, where the \\'Rename\\' option might be found directly or under a submenu like \\'Tools\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dots menu icon at `[83, 946]` was successful. A menu popped up on the right side of the screen, displaying the options: \"File settings\", \"Share\", \"Tools\", \"Info\", and \"Reload\". This action has brought the agent back to a state where it can continue searching for the rename option, which is necessary to complete the active subgoal.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[189,620],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Tools\\' option in the currently open menu. The \\'Tools\\' option is located at approximately `[189, 620]`. This action is expected to open a submenu or a new screen containing tools for file management, hopefully including a \\'Rename\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Tools\\' at `[189, 620]` was successful in opening a submenu. A new submenu titled \"Tools\" appeared, displaying the option \"Speed Read\". However, this submenu does not contain the \"Rename\" option needed to complete the active subgoal. While the action itself was executed correctly (it opened the \\'Tools\\' submenu), it did not bring the agent closer to finding the rename functionality.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 16: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the \\'Back\\' button (keyevent 4) to close the current \"Tools\" submenu. This should return the agent to the main menu (with options like \\'File settings\\', \\'Share\\', \\'Tools\\', \\'Info\\', \\'Reload\\'). The \"Tools\" submenu is currently open on the right side of the screen. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen (e.g., file browser or welcome screen) is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,578],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Format\" option in the \"File settings\" menu. \"Format\" is the last option in the currently visible menu and has an arrow icon, indicating it will open a submenu. This action is taken to find the \"Rename\" option for the file. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \"Format\" at `[345, 578]` was successful in opening a new submenu titled \"Format\". This submenu displays options for different file formats (e.g., \"Key - Value\", \"Plain Text\"). However, this submenu does not contain a \"Rename\" option, which is needed to complete the current subgoal. Therefore, while the action itself was executed correctly, it did not lead directly to the desired outcome of finding the rename functionality. The agent needs to backtrack.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the \\'Back\\' button (keyevent 4) to close the current \\'Format\\' submenu. This should return the agent to the \\'File settings\\' menu. The \\'Format\\' submenu is currently open on the right side of the screen. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the \"Format\" submenu. However, it also unexpectedly closed the parent \"File settings\" menu, returning the agent to the main editor view instead of the \"File settings\" menu. This outcome means the agent needs to re-open the main menu (three-dots icon) to continue searching for the rename option. The action was executed, but the state change requires an adjustment to the planned next steps.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen, at approximately `[83, 946]`. This action is expected to open a menu containing options for the current file, where the \\'Rename\\' option might be found directly or under a submenu like \\'Tools\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dots menu icon at `[83, 946]` was successful. A menu popped up on the right side of the screen, displaying the options: \"File settings\", \"Share\", \"Tools\", \"Info\", and \"Reload\". This action has brought the agent back to a state where it can continue searching for the rename option, which is necessary to complete the active subgoal.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[189,620],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Tools\\' option in the currently open menu. The \\'Tools\\' option is located at approximately `[189, 620]`. This action is expected to open a submenu or a new screen containing tools for file management, hopefully including a \\'Rename\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Tools\\' at `[189, 620]` was successful in opening a submenu. A new submenu titled \"Tools\" appeared, displaying the option \"Speed Read\". However, this submenu does not contain the \"Rename\" option needed to complete the active subgoal. While the action itself was executed correctly (it opened the \\'Tools\\' submenu), it did not bring the agent closer to finding the rename functionality.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the \\'Back\\' button (keyevent 4) to close the current \"Tools\" submenu. This should return the agent to the main menu (with options like \\'File settings\\', \\'Share\\', \\'Tools\\', \\'Info\\', \\'Reload\\'). The \"Tools\" submenu is currently open on the right side of the screen. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the \"Tools\" submenu. However, it also unexpectedly closed the parent main menu, returning the agent to the main editor view instead of the main menu. This outcome means the agent needs to re-open the main menu (three-dots icon) to continue searching for the rename option. The action did not directly bring the agent closer to renaming the file, as it reset the menu navigation.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 41, 36, 138], \\'text\\': \\'15.45\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \\'{\\\\\\'box_2d\\\\\\': [71, 31, 103, 383], \\\\\\'text\\\\\\': \\\\\\'strong_jacket _\"\\\\\\'}\\', \"{\\'box_2d\\': [134, 33, 156, 459], \\'text\\': \\'inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [890, 143, 915, 336], \\'text\\': \\'= ,\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 653], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 619, 100, 700]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 909, 100, 984]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 835, 926, 930]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 521, 98, 606]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 812, 102, 895]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 823, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 595, 935, 699]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 951, 924, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 244, 928, 343]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 716, 100, 797]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 485, 939, 575]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 363, 939, 460]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 128, 926, 225]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 905, 36, 943]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 721, 925, 812]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 9, 925, 102]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 37, 239]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 425, 113, 509]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 116, 37, 188]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"0\", text=\"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\\n\", resource-id=\"net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__highlighting_editor\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"net.gsantner.markor\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[0,275][1080,2102]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\\n\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,578],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Format\" option in the \"File settings\" menu. \"Format\" is the last option in the currently visible menu and has an arrow icon, indicating it will open a submenu. This action is taken to find the \"Rename\" option for the file. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \"Format\" at `[345, 578]` was successful in opening a new submenu titled \"Format\". This submenu displays options for different file formats (e.g., \"Key - Value\", \"Plain Text\"). However, this submenu does not contain a \"Rename\" option, which is needed to complete the current subgoal. Therefore, while the action itself was executed correctly, it did not lead directly to the desired outcome of finding the rename functionality. The agent needs to backtrack.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the \\'Back\\' button (keyevent 4) to close the current \\'Format\\' submenu. This should return the agent to the \\'File settings\\' menu. The \\'Format\\' submenu is currently open on the right side of the screen. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the \"Format\" submenu. However, it also unexpectedly closed the parent \"File settings\" menu, returning the agent to the main editor view instead of the \"File settings\" menu. This outcome means the agent needs to re-open the main menu (three-dots icon) to continue searching for the rename option. The action was executed, but the state change requires an adjustment to the planned next steps.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen, at approximately `[83, 946]`. This action is expected to open a menu containing options for the current file, where the \\'Rename\\' option might be found directly or under a submenu like \\'Tools\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dots menu icon at `[83, 946]` was successful. A menu popped up on the right side of the screen, displaying the options: \"File settings\", \"Share\", \"Tools\", \"Info\", and \"Reload\". This action has brought the agent back to a state where it can continue searching for the rename option, which is necessary to complete the active subgoal.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[189,620],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Tools\\' option in the currently open menu. The \\'Tools\\' option is located at approximately `[189, 620]`. This action is expected to open a submenu or a new screen containing tools for file management, hopefully including a \\'Rename\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Tools\\' at `[189, 620]` was successful in opening a submenu. A new submenu titled \"Tools\" appeared, displaying the option \"Speed Read\". However, this submenu does not contain the \"Rename\" option needed to complete the active subgoal. While the action itself was executed correctly (it opened the \\'Tools\\' submenu), it did not bring the agent closer to finding the rename functionality.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the \\'Back\\' button (keyevent 4) to close the current \"Tools\" submenu. This should return the agent to the main menu (with options like \\'File settings\\', \\'Share\\', \\'Tools\\', \\'Info\\', \\'Reload\\'). The \"Tools\" submenu is currently open on the right side of the screen. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the \"Tools\" submenu. However, it also unexpectedly closed the parent main menu, returning the agent to the main editor view instead of the main menu. This outcome means the agent needs to re-open the main menu (three-dots icon) to continue searching for the rename option. The action did not directly bring the agent closer to renaming the file, as it reset the menu navigation.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 17: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approx. `[83, 946]`). This action is expected to open the main menu, which should contain an \\'Info\\' option, where the rename functionality might be found. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen (e.g., file browser or welcome screen) is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This should return the agent to the \\'File settings\\' menu. The \\'Format\\' submenu is currently open on the right side of the screen. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the \"Format\" submenu. However, it also unexpectedly closed the parent \"File settings\" menu, returning the agent to the main editor view instead of the \"File settings\" menu. This outcome means the agent needs to re-open the main menu (three-dots icon) to continue searching for the rename option. The action was executed, but the state change requires an adjustment to the planned next steps.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen, at approximately `[83, 946]`. This action is expected to open a menu containing options for the current file, where the \\'Rename\\' option might be found directly or under a submenu like \\'Tools\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dots menu icon at `[83, 946]` was successful. A menu popped up on the right side of the screen, displaying the options: \"File settings\", \"Share\", \"Tools\", \"Info\", and \"Reload\". This action has brought the agent back to a state where it can continue searching for the rename option, which is necessary to complete the active subgoal.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[189,620],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Tools\\' option in the currently open menu. The \\'Tools\\' option is located at approximately `[189, 620]`. This action is expected to open a submenu or a new screen containing tools for file management, hopefully including a \\'Rename\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Tools\\' at `[189, 620]` was successful in opening a submenu. A new submenu titled \"Tools\" appeared, displaying the option \"Speed Read\". However, this submenu does not contain the \"Rename\" option needed to complete the active subgoal. While the action itself was executed correctly (it opened the \\'Tools\\' submenu), it did not bring the agent closer to finding the rename functionality.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the \\'Back\\' button (keyevent 4) to close the current \"Tools\" submenu. This should return the agent to the main menu (with options like \\'File settings\\', \\'Share\\', \\'Tools\\', \\'Info\\', \\'Reload\\'). The \"Tools\" submenu is currently open on the right side of the screen. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the \"Tools\" submenu. However, it also unexpectedly closed the parent main menu, returning the agent to the main editor view instead of the main menu. This outcome means the agent needs to re-open the main menu (three-dots icon) to continue searching for the rename option. The action did not directly bring the agent closer to renaming the file, as it reset the menu navigation.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approx. `[83, 946]`). This action is expected to open the main menu, which should contain an \\'Info\\' option, where the rename functionality might be found. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dots menu icon at `[83, 946]` was successful. A menu popped up on the right side of the screen, displaying the options: \"File settings\", \"Share\", \"Tools\", \"Info\", and \"Reload\". This action has brought the agent back to a state where it can continue searching for the rename option, which is necessary to complete the active subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 42, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.46\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 31, 103, 368], \\'text\\': \\'strong_jacket_\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [75, 606, 96, 825], \\'text\\': \\'File settings\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [127, 606, 146, 716], \\'text\\': \\'Share\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [134, 33, 156, 457], \\'text\\': \\'inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [176, 529, 202, 712], \\'text\\': \\'ff Tools\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [232, 606, 251, 683], \\'text\\': \\'Info\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [284, 607, 303, 734], \\'text\\': \\'Reload\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [890, 143, 915, 336], \\'text\\': \\'= ,\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 653], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [268, 510, 321, 997]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [110, 510, 164, 996]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [164, 508, 218, 997]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [215, 512, 269, 998]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 512, 110, 997]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 833, 923, 934]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 592, 923, 703]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 359, 945, 468]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [883, 715, 922, 814]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 949, 922, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 240, 928, 345]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 126, 924, 229]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [884, 483, 921, 579]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [881, 8, 924, 106]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 823, 36, 900]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 905, 36, 942]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 36, 241]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This should return the agent to the \\'File settings\\' menu. The \\'Format\\' submenu is currently open on the right side of the screen. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the \"Format\" submenu. However, it also unexpectedly closed the parent \"File settings\" menu, returning the agent to the main editor view instead of the \"File settings\" menu. This outcome means the agent needs to re-open the main menu (three-dots icon) to continue searching for the rename option. The action was executed, but the state change requires an adjustment to the planned next steps.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen, at approximately `[83, 946]`. This action is expected to open a menu containing options for the current file, where the \\'Rename\\' option might be found directly or under a submenu like \\'Tools\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dots menu icon at `[83, 946]` was successful. A menu popped up on the right side of the screen, displaying the options: \"File settings\", \"Share\", \"Tools\", \"Info\", and \"Reload\". This action has brought the agent back to a state where it can continue searching for the rename option, which is necessary to complete the active subgoal.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[189,620],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Tools\\' option in the currently open menu. The \\'Tools\\' option is located at approximately `[189, 620]`. This action is expected to open a submenu or a new screen containing tools for file management, hopefully including a \\'Rename\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Tools\\' at `[189, 620]` was successful in opening a submenu. A new submenu titled \"Tools\" appeared, displaying the option \"Speed Read\". However, this submenu does not contain the \"Rename\" option needed to complete the active subgoal. While the action itself was executed correctly (it opened the \\'Tools\\' submenu), it did not bring the agent closer to finding the rename functionality.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the \\'Back\\' button (keyevent 4) to close the current \"Tools\" submenu. This should return the agent to the main menu (with options like \\'File settings\\', \\'Share\\', \\'Tools\\', \\'Info\\', \\'Reload\\'). The \"Tools\" submenu is currently open on the right side of the screen. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the \"Tools\" submenu. However, it also unexpectedly closed the parent main menu, returning the agent to the main editor view instead of the main menu. This outcome means the agent needs to re-open the main menu (three-dots icon) to continue searching for the rename option. The action did not directly bring the agent closer to renaming the file, as it reset the menu navigation.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approx. `[83, 946]`). This action is expected to open the main menu, which should contain an \\'Info\\' option, where the rename functionality might be found. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dots menu icon at `[83, 946]` was successful. A menu popped up on the right side of the screen, displaying the options: \"File settings\", \"Share\", \"Tools\", \"Info\", and \"Reload\". This action has brought the agent back to a state where it can continue searching for the rename option, which is necessary to complete the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 18: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[241,750],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Info\\' option in the currently open menu. The \\'Info\\' option is detected with bounding box `[232, 606, 251, 683]`. Tapping its center (approx. `[241, 750]`) is expected to open a submenu or a new screen related to file information, which might contain the \\'Rename\\' option.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen, at approximately `[83, 946]`. This action is expected to open a menu containing options for the current file, where the \\'Rename\\' option might be found directly or under a submenu like \\'Tools\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dots menu icon at `[83, 946]` was successful. A menu popped up on the right side of the screen, displaying the options: \"File settings\", \"Share\", \"Tools\", \"Info\", and \"Reload\". This action has brought the agent back to a state where it can continue searching for the rename option, which is necessary to complete the active subgoal.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[189,620],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Tools\\' option in the currently open menu. The \\'Tools\\' option is located at approximately `[189, 620]`. This action is expected to open a submenu or a new screen containing tools for file management, hopefully including a \\'Rename\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Tools\\' at `[189, 620]` was successful in opening a submenu. A new submenu titled \"Tools\" appeared, displaying the option \"Speed Read\". However, this submenu does not contain the \"Rename\" option needed to complete the active subgoal. While the action itself was executed correctly (it opened the \\'Tools\\' submenu), it did not bring the agent closer to finding the rename functionality.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the \\'Back\\' button (keyevent 4) to close the current \"Tools\" submenu. This should return the agent to the main menu (with options like \\'File settings\\', \\'Share\\', \\'Tools\\', \\'Info\\', \\'Reload\\'). The \"Tools\" submenu is currently open on the right side of the screen. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the \"Tools\" submenu. However, it also unexpectedly closed the parent main menu, returning the agent to the main editor view instead of the main menu. This outcome means the agent needs to re-open the main menu (three-dots icon) to continue searching for the rename option. The action did not directly bring the agent closer to renaming the file, as it reset the menu navigation.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approx. `[83, 946]`). This action is expected to open the main menu, which should contain an \\'Info\\' option, where the rename functionality might be found. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dots menu icon at `[83, 946]` was successful. A menu popped up on the right side of the screen, displaying the options: \"File settings\", \"Share\", \"Tools\", \"Info\", and \"Reload\". This action has brought the agent back to a state where it can continue searching for the rename option, which is necessary to complete the active subgoal.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[241,750],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Info\\' option in the currently open menu. The \\'Info\\' option is detected with bounding box `[232, 606, 251, 683]`. Tapping its center (approx. `[241, 750]`) is expected to open a submenu or a new screen related to file information, which might contain the \\'Rename\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Info\\' successfully opened the \\'Info\\' dialog box. This dialog provides information about the file such as its name, location, size, and modification date. However, it does not contain a \\'Rename\\' option, which is needed for the current subgoal. The action brought the agent one step further in exploring menu options, but the rename functionality remains undiscovered. To proceed, the \\'Info\\' dialog needs to be closed, likely by tapping the \\'OK\\' button.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen, at approximately `[83, 946]`. This action is expected to open a menu containing options for the current file, where the \\'Rename\\' option might be found directly or under a submenu like \\'Tools\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dots menu icon at `[83, 946]` was successful. A menu popped up on the right side of the screen, displaying the options: \"File settings\", \"Share\", \"Tools\", \"Info\", and \"Reload\". This action has brought the agent back to a state where it can continue searching for the rename option, which is necessary to complete the active subgoal.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[189,620],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Tools\\' option in the currently open menu. The \\'Tools\\' option is located at approximately `[189, 620]`. This action is expected to open a submenu or a new screen containing tools for file management, hopefully including a \\'Rename\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Tools\\' at `[189, 620]` was successful in opening a submenu. A new submenu titled \"Tools\" appeared, displaying the option \"Speed Read\". However, this submenu does not contain the \"Rename\" option needed to complete the active subgoal. While the action itself was executed correctly (it opened the \\'Tools\\' submenu), it did not bring the agent closer to finding the rename functionality.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the \\'Back\\' button (keyevent 4) to close the current \"Tools\" submenu. This should return the agent to the main menu (with options like \\'File settings\\', \\'Share\\', \\'Tools\\', \\'Info\\', \\'Reload\\'). The \"Tools\" submenu is currently open on the right side of the screen. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the \"Tools\" submenu. However, it also unexpectedly closed the parent main menu, returning the agent to the main editor view instead of the main menu. This outcome means the agent needs to re-open the main menu (three-dots icon) to continue searching for the rename option. The action did not directly bring the agent closer to renaming the file, as it reset the menu navigation.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approx. `[83, 946]`). This action is expected to open the main menu, which should contain an \\'Info\\' option, where the rename functionality might be found. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dots menu icon at `[83, 946]` was successful. A menu popped up on the right side of the screen, displaying the options: \"File settings\", \"Share\", \"Tools\", \"Info\", and \"Reload\". This action has brought the agent back to a state where it can continue searching for the rename option, which is necessary to complete the active subgoal.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[241,750],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Info\\' option in the currently open menu. The \\'Info\\' option is detected with bounding box `[232, 606, 251, 683]`. Tapping its center (approx. `[241, 750]`) is expected to open a submenu or a new screen related to file information, which might contain the \\'Rename\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Info\\' successfully opened the \\'Info\\' dialog box. This dialog provides information about the file such as its name, location, size, and modification date. However, it does not contain a \\'Rename\\' option, which is needed for the current subgoal. The action brought the agent one step further in exploring menu options, but the rename functionality remains undiscovered. To proceed, the \\'Info\\' dialog needs to be closed, likely by tapping the \\'OK\\' button.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 19: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[770,856],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button, located at approximately `[770, 856]` (center of bounding box `[763, 831, 777, 882]`), to close the \\'Info\\' dialog. This is expected to return the view to the Markor editor screen, allowing further attempts to find the rename functionality.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The \\'Tools\\' option is located at approximately `[189, 620]`. This action is expected to open a submenu or a new screen containing tools for file management, hopefully including a \\'Rename\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Tools\\' at `[189, 620]` was successful in opening a submenu. A new submenu titled \"Tools\" appeared, displaying the option \"Speed Read\". However, this submenu does not contain the \"Rename\" option needed to complete the active subgoal. While the action itself was executed correctly (it opened the \\'Tools\\' submenu), it did not bring the agent closer to finding the rename functionality.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the \\'Back\\' button (keyevent 4) to close the current \"Tools\" submenu. This should return the agent to the main menu (with options like \\'File settings\\', \\'Share\\', \\'Tools\\', \\'Info\\', \\'Reload\\'). The \"Tools\" submenu is currently open on the right side of the screen. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the \"Tools\" submenu. However, it also unexpectedly closed the parent main menu, returning the agent to the main editor view instead of the main menu. This outcome means the agent needs to re-open the main menu (three-dots icon) to continue searching for the rename option. The action did not directly bring the agent closer to renaming the file, as it reset the menu navigation.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approx. `[83, 946]`). This action is expected to open the main menu, which should contain an \\'Info\\' option, where the rename functionality might be found. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dots menu icon at `[83, 946]` was successful. A menu popped up on the right side of the screen, displaying the options: \"File settings\", \"Share\", \"Tools\", \"Info\", and \"Reload\". This action has brought the agent back to a state where it can continue searching for the rename option, which is necessary to complete the active subgoal.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[241,750],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Info\\' option in the currently open menu. The \\'Info\\' option is detected with bounding box `[232, 606, 251, 683]`. Tapping its center (approx. `[241, 750]`) is expected to open a submenu or a new screen related to file information, which might contain the \\'Rename\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Info\\' successfully opened the \\'Info\\' dialog box. This dialog provides information about the file such as its name, location, size, and modification date. However, it does not contain a \\'Rename\\' option, which is needed for the current subgoal. The action brought the agent one step further in exploring menu options, but the rename functionality remains undiscovered. To proceed, the \\'Info\\' dialog needs to be closed, likely by tapping the \\'OK\\' button.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[770,856],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button, located at approximately `[770, 856]` (center of bounding box `[763, 831, 777, 882]`), to close the \\'Info\\' dialog. This is expected to return the view to the Markor editor screen, allowing further attempts to find the rename functionality. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'OK\\' button (located at approximately `[770, 856]`) was successful. The \\'Info\\' dialog box, which provided details about the file, has been closed. The application has returned to the main editor view, displaying the content of the file \\'strong_jacket_h1hZ.txt\\'.

The text you can edit is: \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\\n\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\\n\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nUpdate the content of strong_jacket_h1hZ.txt to \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" in Markor and change its name to lively_fox_2023_03_22.md.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[189,620],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Tools\\' option in the currently open menu. The \\'Tools\\' option is located at approximately `[189, 620]`. This action is expected to open a submenu or a new screen containing tools for file management, hopefully including a \\'Rename\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Tools\\' at `[189, 620]` was successful in opening a submenu. A new submenu titled \"Tools\" appeared, displaying the option \"Speed Read\". However, this submenu does not contain the \"Rename\" option needed to complete the active subgoal. While the action itself was executed correctly (it opened the \\'Tools\\' submenu), it did not bring the agent closer to finding the rename functionality.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the \\'Back\\' button (keyevent 4) to close the current \"Tools\" submenu. This should return the agent to the main menu (with options like \\'File settings\\', \\'Share\\', \\'Tools\\', \\'Info\\', \\'Reload\\'). The \"Tools\" submenu is currently open on the right side of the screen. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the \"Tools\" submenu. However, it also unexpectedly closed the parent main menu, returning the agent to the main editor view instead of the main menu. This outcome means the agent needs to re-open the main menu (three-dots icon) to continue searching for the rename option. The action did not directly bring the agent closer to renaming the file, as it reset the menu navigation.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approx. `[83, 946]`). This action is expected to open the main menu, which should contain an \\'Info\\' option, where the rename functionality might be found. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dots menu icon at `[83, 946]` was successful. A menu popped up on the right side of the screen, displaying the options: \"File settings\", \"Share\", \"Tools\", \"Info\", and \"Reload\". This action has brought the agent back to a state where it can continue searching for the rename option, which is necessary to complete the active subgoal.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[241,750],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Info\\' option in the currently open menu. The \\'Info\\' option is detected with bounding box `[232, 606, 251, 683]`. Tapping its center (approx. `[241, 750]`) is expected to open a submenu or a new screen related to file information, which might contain the \\'Rename\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Info\\' successfully opened the \\'Info\\' dialog box. This dialog provides information about the file such as its name, location, size, and modification date. However, it does not contain a \\'Rename\\' option, which is needed for the current subgoal. The action brought the agent one step further in exploring menu options, but the rename functionality remains undiscovered. To proceed, the \\'Info\\' dialog needs to be closed, likely by tapping the \\'OK\\' button.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[770,856],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button, located at approximately `[770, 856]` (center of bounding box `[763, 831, 777, 882]`), to close the \\'Info\\' dialog. This is expected to return the view to the Markor editor screen, allowing further attempts to find the rename functionality. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'OK\\' button (located at approximately `[770, 856]`) was successful. The \\'Info\\' dialog box, which provided details about the file, has been closed. The application has returned to the main editor view, displaying the content of the file \\'strong_jacket_h1hZ.txt\\'. This action allows the agent to proceed with finding the rename functionality, as the \\'Info\\' dialog did not offer this option.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 20: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[87,207],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file name \\'strong_jacket_...\\' displayed at the top of the editor, at approximately `[87, 207]`. This action is an attempt to find a rename option, as per the current plan, after failing to find it in the main menu options. It is predicted that tapping the file name might open a dialog for renaming the file or reveal a rename option. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen (e.g., file browser or welcome screen) is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This should return the agent to the main menu (with options like \\'File settings\\', \\'Share\\', \\'Tools\\', \\'Info\\', \\'Reload\\'). The \"Tools\" submenu is currently open on the right side of the screen. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the \"Tools\" submenu. However, it also unexpectedly closed the parent main menu, returning the agent to the main editor view instead of the main menu. This outcome means the agent needs to re-open the main menu (three-dots icon) to continue searching for the rename option. The action did not directly bring the agent closer to renaming the file, as it reset the menu navigation.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approx. `[83, 946]`). This action is expected to open the main menu, which should contain an \\'Info\\' option, where the rename functionality might be found. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dots menu icon at `[83, 946]` was successful. A menu popped up on the right side of the screen, displaying the options: \"File settings\", \"Share\", \"Tools\", \"Info\", and \"Reload\". This action has brought the agent back to a state where it can continue searching for the rename option, which is necessary to complete the active subgoal.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[241,750],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Info\\' option in the currently open menu. The \\'Info\\' option is detected with bounding box `[232, 606, 251, 683]`. Tapping its center (approx. `[241, 750]`) is expected to open a submenu or a new screen related to file information, which might contain the \\'Rename\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Info\\' successfully opened the \\'Info\\' dialog box. This dialog provides information about the file such as its name, location, size, and modification date. However, it does not contain a \\'Rename\\' option, which is needed for the current subgoal. The action brought the agent one step further in exploring menu options, but the rename functionality remains undiscovered. To proceed, the \\'Info\\' dialog needs to be closed, likely by tapping the \\'OK\\' button.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[770,856],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button, located at approximately `[770, 856]` (center of bounding box `[763, 831, 777, 882]`), to close the \\'Info\\' dialog. This is expected to return the view to the Markor editor screen, allowing further attempts to find the rename functionality. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'OK\\' button (located at approximately `[770, 856]`) was successful. The \\'Info\\' dialog box, which provided details about the file, has been closed. The application has returned to the main editor view, displaying the content of the file \\'strong_jacket_h1hZ.txt\\'. This action allows the agent to proceed with finding the rename functionality, as the \\'Info\\' dialog did not offer this option.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[87,207],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file name \\'strong_jacket_...\\' displayed at the top of the editor, at approximately `[87, 207]`. This action is an attempt to find a rename option, as per the current plan, after failing to find it in the main menu options. It is predicted that tapping the file name might open a dialog for renaming the file or reveal a rename option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the file name \\'strong_jacket_...\\' at `[87, 207]` did not open a rename dialog as expected. Instead, it appended an \\'l\\' character to the text content in the editor, changing it from \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" to \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7l\". This action was a failure in terms of achieving the goal of renaming the file and inadvertently modified the file content. The agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal. To correct this, the extra character needs to be deleted, and then an alternative method for renaming should be attempted.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\\n\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This should return the agent to the main menu (with options like \\'File settings\\', \\'Share\\', \\'Tools\\', \\'Info\\', \\'Reload\\'). The \"Tools\" submenu is currently open on the right side of the screen. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully closed the \"Tools\" submenu. However, it also unexpectedly closed the parent main menu, returning the agent to the main editor view instead of the main menu. This outcome means the agent needs to re-open the main menu (three-dots icon) to continue searching for the rename option. The action did not directly bring the agent closer to renaming the file, as it reset the menu navigation.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approx. `[83, 946]`). This action is expected to open the main menu, which should contain an \\'Info\\' option, where the rename functionality might be found. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dots menu icon at `[83, 946]` was successful. A menu popped up on the right side of the screen, displaying the options: \"File settings\", \"Share\", \"Tools\", \"Info\", and \"Reload\". This action has brought the agent back to a state where it can continue searching for the rename option, which is necessary to complete the active subgoal.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[241,750],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Info\\' option in the currently open menu. The \\'Info\\' option is detected with bounding box `[232, 606, 251, 683]`. Tapping its center (approx. `[241, 750]`) is expected to open a submenu or a new screen related to file information, which might contain the \\'Rename\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Info\\' successfully opened the \\'Info\\' dialog box. This dialog provides information about the file such as its name, location, size, and modification date. However, it does not contain a \\'Rename\\' option, which is needed for the current subgoal. The action brought the agent one step further in exploring menu options, but the rename functionality remains undiscovered. To proceed, the \\'Info\\' dialog needs to be closed, likely by tapping the \\'OK\\' button.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[770,856],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button, located at approximately `[770, 856]` (center of bounding box `[763, 831, 777, 882]`), to close the \\'Info\\' dialog. This is expected to return the view to the Markor editor screen, allowing further attempts to find the rename functionality. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'OK\\' button (located at approximately `[770, 856]`) was successful. The \\'Info\\' dialog box, which provided details about the file, has been closed. The application has returned to the main editor view, displaying the content of the file \\'strong_jacket_h1hZ.txt\\'. This action allows the agent to proceed with finding the rename functionality, as the \\'Info\\' dialog did not offer this option.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[87,207],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file name \\'strong_jacket_...\\' displayed at the top of the editor, at approximately `[87, 207]`. This action is an attempt to find a rename option, as per the current plan, after failing to find it in the main menu options. It is predicted that tapping the file name might open a dialog for renaming the file or reveal a rename option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the file name \\'strong_jacket_...\\' at `[87, 207]` did not open a rename dialog as expected. Instead, it appended an \\'l\\' character to the text content in the editor, changing it from \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" to \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7l\". This action was a failure in terms of achieving the goal of renaming the file and inadvertently modified the file content. The agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal. To correct this, the extra character needs to be deleted, and then an alternative method for renaming should be attempted.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 21: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"67\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send `KEYCODE_DEL` (67) to delete the last character (\\'l\\') from the text editor. The current text is \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7l\". After this action, the text should be \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\". The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen (e.g., file browser or welcome screen) is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approx. `[83, 946]`). This action is expected to open the main menu, which should contain an \\'Info\\' option, where the rename functionality might be found. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dots menu icon at `[83, 946]` was successful. A menu popped up on the right side of the screen, displaying the options: \"File settings\", \"Share\", \"Tools\", \"Info\", and \"Reload\". This action has brought the agent back to a state where it can continue searching for the rename option, which is necessary to complete the active subgoal.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[241,750],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Info\\' option in the currently open menu. The \\'Info\\' option is detected with bounding box `[232, 606, 251, 683]`. Tapping its center (approx. `[241, 750]`) is expected to open a submenu or a new screen related to file information, which might contain the \\'Rename\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Info\\' successfully opened the \\'Info\\' dialog box. This dialog provides information about the file such as its name, location, size, and modification date. However, it does not contain a \\'Rename\\' option, which is needed for the current subgoal. The action brought the agent one step further in exploring menu options, but the rename functionality remains undiscovered. To proceed, the \\'Info\\' dialog needs to be closed, likely by tapping the \\'OK\\' button.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[770,856],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button, located at approximately `[770, 856]` (center of bounding box `[763, 831, 777, 882]`), to close the \\'Info\\' dialog. This is expected to return the view to the Markor editor screen, allowing further attempts to find the rename functionality. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'OK\\' button (located at approximately `[770, 856]`) was successful. The \\'Info\\' dialog box, which provided details about the file, has been closed. The application has returned to the main editor view, displaying the content of the file \\'strong_jacket_h1hZ.txt\\'. This action allows the agent to proceed with finding the rename functionality, as the \\'Info\\' dialog did not offer this option.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[87,207],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file name \\'strong_jacket_...\\' displayed at the top of the editor, at approximately `[87, 207]`. This action is an attempt to find a rename option, as per the current plan, after failing to find it in the main menu options. It is predicted that tapping the file name might open a dialog for renaming the file or reveal a rename option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the file name \\'strong_jacket_...\\' at `[87, 207]` did not open a rename dialog as expected. Instead, it appended an \\'l\\' character to the text content in the editor, changing it from \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" to \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7l\". This action was a failure in terms of achieving the goal of renaming the file and inadvertently modified the file content. The agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal. To correct this, the extra character needs to be deleted, and then an alternative method for renaming should be attempted.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"67\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send `KEYCODE_DEL` (67) to delete the last character (\\'l\\') from the text editor. The current text is \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7l\". After this action, the text should be \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\". Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_DEL` action deleted the last character from the text editor. Based on the XML data, the text changed from \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\\\\n\" to \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp\\\\n\", meaning the character \\'7\\' was deleted. The current text is \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp\". The desired text is \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\". The action did not bring the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3, as the content is still incorrect. To correct this, the character \\'7\\' needs to be appended to the current text.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp\\n\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approx. `[83, 946]`). This action is expected to open the main menu, which should contain an \\'Info\\' option, where the rename functionality might be found. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dots menu icon at `[83, 946]` was successful. A menu popped up on the right side of the screen, displaying the options: \"File settings\", \"Share\", \"Tools\", \"Info\", and \"Reload\". This action has brought the agent back to a state where it can continue searching for the rename option, which is necessary to complete the active subgoal.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[241,750],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Info\\' option in the currently open menu. The \\'Info\\' option is detected with bounding box `[232, 606, 251, 683]`. Tapping its center (approx. `[241, 750]`) is expected to open a submenu or a new screen related to file information, which might contain the \\'Rename\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Info\\' successfully opened the \\'Info\\' dialog box. This dialog provides information about the file such as its name, location, size, and modification date. However, it does not contain a \\'Rename\\' option, which is needed for the current subgoal. The action brought the agent one step further in exploring menu options, but the rename functionality remains undiscovered. To proceed, the \\'Info\\' dialog needs to be closed, likely by tapping the \\'OK\\' button.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[770,856],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button, located at approximately `[770, 856]` (center of bounding box `[763, 831, 777, 882]`), to close the \\'Info\\' dialog. This is expected to return the view to the Markor editor screen, allowing further attempts to find the rename functionality. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'OK\\' button (located at approximately `[770, 856]`) was successful. The \\'Info\\' dialog box, which provided details about the file, has been closed. The application has returned to the main editor view, displaying the content of the file \\'strong_jacket_h1hZ.txt\\'. This action allows the agent to proceed with finding the rename functionality, as the \\'Info\\' dialog did not offer this option.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[87,207],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file name \\'strong_jacket_...\\' displayed at the top of the editor, at approximately `[87, 207]`. This action is an attempt to find a rename option, as per the current plan, after failing to find it in the main menu options. It is predicted that tapping the file name might open a dialog for renaming the file or reveal a rename option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the file name \\'strong_jacket_...\\' at `[87, 207]` did not open a rename dialog as expected. Instead, it appended an \\'l\\' character to the text content in the editor, changing it from \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" to \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7l\". This action was a failure in terms of achieving the goal of renaming the file and inadvertently modified the file content. The agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal. To correct this, the extra character needs to be deleted, and then an alternative method for renaming should be attempted.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"67\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send `KEYCODE_DEL` (67) to delete the last character (\\'l\\') from the text editor. The current text is \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7l\". After this action, the text should be \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\". Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_DEL` action deleted the last character from the text editor. Based on the XML data, the text changed from \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\\\\n\" to \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp\\\\n\", meaning the character \\'7\\' was deleted. The current text is \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp\". The desired text is \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\". The action did not bring the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3, as the content is still incorrect. To correct this, the character \\'7\\' needs to be appended to the current text.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 22: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"7\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Append the character \\'7\\' to the currently focused text field. The current text is \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp\". After this action, the text should become \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\". The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen (e.g., file browser or welcome screen) is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[241,750],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Info\\' option in the currently open menu. The \\'Info\\' option is detected with bounding box `[232, 606, 251, 683]`. Tapping its center (approx. `[241, 750]`) is expected to open a submenu or a new screen related to file information, which might contain the \\'Rename\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Info\\' successfully opened the \\'Info\\' dialog box. This dialog provides information about the file such as its name, location, size, and modification date. However, it does not contain a \\'Rename\\' option, which is needed for the current subgoal. The action brought the agent one step further in exploring menu options, but the rename functionality remains undiscovered. To proceed, the \\'Info\\' dialog needs to be closed, likely by tapping the \\'OK\\' button.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[770,856],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button, located at approximately `[770, 856]` (center of bounding box `[763, 831, 777, 882]`), to close the \\'Info\\' dialog. This is expected to return the view to the Markor editor screen, allowing further attempts to find the rename functionality. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'OK\\' button (located at approximately `[770, 856]`) was successful. The \\'Info\\' dialog box, which provided details about the file, has been closed. The application has returned to the main editor view, displaying the content of the file \\'strong_jacket_h1hZ.txt\\'. This action allows the agent to proceed with finding the rename functionality, as the \\'Info\\' dialog did not offer this option.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[87,207],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file name \\'strong_jacket_...\\' displayed at the top of the editor, at approximately `[87, 207]`. This action is an attempt to find a rename option, as per the current plan, after failing to find it in the main menu options. It is predicted that tapping the file name might open a dialog for renaming the file or reveal a rename option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the file name \\'strong_jacket_...\\' at `[87, 207]` did not open a rename dialog as expected. Instead, it appended an \\'l\\' character to the text content in the editor, changing it from \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\" to \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7l\". This action was a failure in terms of achieving the goal of renaming the file and inadvertently modified the file content. The agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal. To correct this, the extra character needs to be deleted, and then an alternative method for renaming should be attempted.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"67\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send `KEYCODE_DEL` (67) to delete the last character (\\'l\\') from the text editor. The current text is \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7l\". After this action, the text should be \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\". Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_DEL` action deleted the last character from the text editor. Based on the XML data, the text changed from \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\\\\n\" to \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp\\\\n\", meaning the character \\'7\\' was deleted. The current text is \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp\". The desired text is \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\". The action did not bring the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3, as the content is still incorrect. To correct this, the character \\'7\\' needs to be appended to the current text.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"7\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Append the character \\'7\\' to the currently focused text field. The current text is \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp\". After this action, the text should become \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\". Actual Outcome: The action of appending \\'7\\' to the text editor was successful. The XML data for the text field changed from \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp\\\\n\" to \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\\\\n\". This means the content of the file in the editor now matches the target content \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\". Although the OCR detected the text as \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7l\", the XML data is deemed more reliable and consistent with the action performed. This action has brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3, as the content is now correct. The next step is to save the updated content.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"inNqu8UNNtyXBHCZpYp7\\n\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",
