Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, you plan to add important text information to the agent\\'s memory. If required, explicitly mention adding and completing information to the agent memory in your plan.---\\nProvide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is intended to reveal the list of all installed applications, where the Markor app can then be located. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of finding and opening the Markor app. The Markor app is now visible on the screen.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[868,615],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon, which is currently visible in the app drawer. The icon is located near the text \\'Markor\\'. The tap coordinates are [868, 615]. This action is predicted to open the Markor application. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Markor app icon successfully opened the Markor application. The screen changed from the app drawer to the Markor app\\'s main interface, which displays a list of files that appear to be notes. This action has brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction by completing the first subgoal. The Markor app is now open and ready for further interaction to delete the notes.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.36\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [74, 38, 96, 203], \\'text\\': \\'Markor\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 728, 95, 888], \\'text\\': \\'= Q\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [143, 139, 167, 689], \\'text\\': \\'Istorage/emulated/0 /Documents\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [183, 143, 223, 449], \\'text\\': \\'.app 10/15/2023, 15.35\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [234, 140, 283, 777], \\'text\\': \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md 10/15/2023, 15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [298, 142, 343, 849], \\'text\\': \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md 10/15/2023, 15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [358, 140, 404, 865], \\'text\\': \\'final_budget_home_renovation.md 10/15/2023, 15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [950, 85, 966, 163], \\'text\\': \\'Files\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [951, 332, 966, 417], \\'text\\': \\'To-Do\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 553, 966, 699], \\'text\\': \\'QuickNote\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 840, 966, 913], \\'text\\': \\'More\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [833, 819, 896, 969]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 494, 974, 758]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 0, 974, 257]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 254, 974, 499]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 822, 37, 899]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 813, 104, 895]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 907, 102, 984]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 617, 112, 704]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 837, 972, 914]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 710, 99, 797]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 905, 37, 943]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 194, 39, 241]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [984, 363, 1000, 634]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is intended to reveal the list of all installed applications, where the Markor app can then be located. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of finding and opening the Markor app. The Markor app is now visible on the screen.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[868,615],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon, which is currently visible in the app drawer. The icon is located near the text \\'Markor\\'. The tap coordinates are [868, 615]. This action is predicted to open the Markor application. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Markor app icon successfully opened the Markor application. The screen changed from the app drawer to the Markor app\\'s main interface, which displays a list of files that appear to be notes. This action has brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction by completing the first subgoal. The Markor app is now open and ready for further interaction to delete the notes.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 2: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of finding and opening the Markor app. The Markor app is now visible on the screen.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[868,615],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon, which is currently visible in the app drawer. The icon is located near the text \\'Markor\\'. The tap coordinates are [868, 615]. This action is predicted to open the Markor application. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Markor app icon successfully opened the Markor application. The screen changed from the app drawer to the Markor app\\'s main interface, which displays a list of files that appear to be notes. This action has brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction by completing the first subgoal. The Markor app is now open and ready for further interaction to delete the notes.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen (coordinates [84, 945]). This action is predicted to open a context menu which might contain an option to \\'Select All\\' notes. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon successfully opened a context menu. However, the menu options (\\'Import from device\\' and \\'Settings\\') do not include a \\'Select All\\' feature or any other option relevant to selecting notes for deletion. While the action itself was executed correctly (a menu appeared), it did not directly bring the agent closer to selecting all notes. A different approach is needed, such as long-pressing a note.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is intended to reveal the list of all installed applications, where the Markor app can then be located. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of finding and opening the Markor app. The Markor app is now visible on the screen.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[868,615],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon, which is currently visible in the app drawer. The icon is located near the text \\'Markor\\'. The tap coordinates are [868, 615]. This action is predicted to open the Markor application. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Markor app icon successfully opened the Markor application. The screen changed from the app drawer to the Markor app\\'s main interface, which displays a list of files that appear to be notes. This action has brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction by completing the first subgoal. The Markor app is now open and ready for further interaction to delete the notes.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen (coordinates [84, 945]). This action is predicted to open a context menu which might contain an option to \\'Select All\\' notes. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon successfully opened a context menu. However, the menu options (\\'Import from device\\' and \\'Settings\\') do not include a \\'Select All\\' feature or any other option relevant to selecting notes for deletion. While the action itself was executed correctly (a menu appeared), it did not directly bring the agent closer to selecting all notes. A different approach is needed, such as long-pressing a note.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 3: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[259,459],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the note titled \"art_project_sketches_st16.md\" (coordinates [259, 459]). This action is predicted to activate a selection mode, allowing for the selection of multiple notes for deletion. The menu currently open on the right side of the screen might close as a result of this interaction.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action did not directly achieve the goal of selecting notes, but it changed the UI, presenting new elements to interact with, specifically a new three-dots menu icon at the top right.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is intended to reveal the list of all installed applications, where the Markor app can then be located. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of finding and opening the Markor app. The Markor app is now visible on the screen.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[868,615],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon, which is currently visible in the app drawer. The icon is located near the text \\'Markor\\'. The tap coordinates are [868, 615]. This action is predicted to open the Markor application. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Markor app icon successfully opened the Markor application. The screen changed from the app drawer to the Markor app\\'s main interface, which displays a list of files that appear to be notes. This action has brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction by completing the first subgoal. The Markor app is now open and ready for further interaction to delete the notes.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen (coordinates [84, 945]). This action is predicted to open a context menu which might contain an option to \\'Select All\\' notes. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon successfully opened a context menu. However, the menu options (\\'Import from device\\' and \\'Settings\\') do not include a \\'Select All\\' feature or any other option relevant to selecting notes for deletion. While the action itself was executed correctly (a menu appeared), it did not directly bring the agent closer to selecting all notes. A different approach is needed, such as long-pressing a note.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[259,459],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the note titled \"art_project_sketches_st16.md\" (coordinates [259, 459]). This action is predicted to activate a selection mode, allowing for the selection of multiple notes for deletion. The menu currently open on the right side of the screen might close as a result of this interaction. Actual Outcome: The long-press on the note \"art_project_sketches_st16.md\" closed the pop-up menu that was previously open. The file path at the top changed to \"/storage/emulated/0 /Documents\", and the icons in the top bar were updated. The note itself does not appear to be selected. This action did not directly achieve the goal of selecting notes, but it changed the UI, presenting new elements to interact with, specifically a new three-dots menu icon at the top right.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 4: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen (coordinates [84, 945]). This action is predicted to open a context menu which might contain options like \\'Select All\\', \\'Select\\', or \\'Delete\\', which are relevant for selecting and deleting notes. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Find and Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen is visible, OR it\\'s determined that Markor is not installed. `MarkorAppAccessibility` is updated to \\'Markor Opened\\' or \\'Markor Not Found\\'.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The app drawer was opened, and the Markor app icon was tapped.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is predicted to open a context menu which might contain an option to \\'Select All\\' notes. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon successfully opened a context menu. However, the menu options (\\'Import from device\\' and \\'Settings\\') do not include a \\'Select All\\' feature or any other option relevant to selecting notes for deletion. While the action itself was executed correctly (a menu appeared), it did not directly bring the agent closer to selecting all notes. A different approach is needed, such as long-pressing a note.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[259,459],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the note titled \"art_project_sketches_st16.md\" (coordinates [259, 459]). This action is predicted to activate a selection mode, allowing for the selection of multiple notes for deletion. The menu currently open on the right side of the screen might close as a result of this interaction. Actual Outcome: The long-press on the note \"art_project_sketches_st16.md\" closed the pop-up menu that was previously open. The file path at the top changed to \"/storage/emulated/0 /Documents\", and the icons in the top bar were updated. The note itself does not appear to be selected. This action did not directly achieve the goal of selecting notes, but it changed the UI, presenting new elements to interact with, specifically a new three-dots menu icon at the top right.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen (coordinates [84, 945]). This action is predicted to open a context menu which might contain options like \\'Select All\\', \\'Select\\', or \\'Delete\\', which are relevant for selecting and deleting notes. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon successfully opened a pop-up menu. However, the menu options (\\'Import from device\\' and \\'Settings\\') do not provide any functionality for selecting or deleting notes. Therefore, while the action was executed as intended (opening the menu), it did not bring the agent closer to the goal of deleting notes. A different strategy is required to select the notes.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is intended to reveal the list of all installed applications, where the Markor app can then be located. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of finding and opening the Markor app. The Markor app is now visible on the screen.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[868,615],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon, which is currently visible in the app drawer. The icon is located near the text \\'Markor\\'. The tap coordinates are [868, 615]. This action is predicted to open the Markor application. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Markor app icon successfully opened the Markor application. The screen changed from the app drawer to the Markor app\\'s main interface, which displays a list of files that appear to be notes. This action has brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction by completing the first subgoal. The Markor app is now open and ready for further interaction to delete the notes.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen (coordinates [84, 945]). This action is predicted to open a context menu which might contain an option to \\'Select All\\' notes. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon successfully opened a context menu. However, the menu options (\\'Import from device\\' and \\'Settings\\') do not include a \\'Select All\\' feature or any other option relevant to selecting notes for deletion. While the action itself was executed correctly (a menu appeared), it did not directly bring the agent closer to selecting all notes. A different approach is needed, such as long-pressing a note.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[259,459],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the note titled \"art_project_sketches_st16.md\" (coordinates [259, 459]). This action is predicted to activate a selection mode, allowing for the selection of multiple notes for deletion. The menu currently open on the right side of the screen might close as a result of this interaction. Actual Outcome: The long-press on the note \"art_project_sketches_st16.md\" closed the pop-up menu that was previously open. The file path at the top changed to \"/storage/emulated/0 /Documents\", and the icons in the top bar were updated. The note itself does not appear to be selected. This action did not directly achieve the goal of selecting notes, but it changed the UI, presenting new elements to interact with, specifically a new three-dots menu icon at the top right.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen (coordinates [84, 945]). This action is predicted to open a context menu which might contain options like \\'Select All\\', \\'Select\\', or \\'Delete\\', which are relevant for selecting and deleting notes. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon successfully opened a pop-up menu. However, the menu options (\\'Import from device\\' and \\'Settings\\') do not provide any functionality for selecting or deleting notes. Therefore, while the action was executed as intended (opening the menu), it did not bring the agent closer to the goal of deleting notes. A different strategy is required to select the notes.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 5: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[320,495],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' at approximately [320, 495] to close the currently open pop-up menu. The pop-up menu is expected to disappear, returning to the file list view. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Find and Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen is visible, OR it\\'s determined that Markor is not installed. `MarkorAppAccessibility` is updated to \\'Markor Opened\\' or \\'Markor Not Found\\'.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The app drawer was opened, and the Markor app icon was tapped.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen (coordinates [84, 945]). This action is predicted to open a context menu which might contain an option to \\'Select All\\' notes. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon successfully opened a context menu. However, the menu options (\\'Import from device\\' and \\'Settings\\') do not include a \\'Select All\\' feature or any other option relevant to selecting notes for deletion. While the action itself was executed correctly (a menu appeared), it did not directly bring the agent closer to selecting all notes. A different approach is needed, such as long-pressing a note.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[259,459],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the note titled \"art_project_sketches_st16.md\" (coordinates [259, 459]). This action is predicted to activate a selection mode, allowing for the selection of multiple notes for deletion. The menu currently open on the right side of the screen might close as a result of this interaction. Actual Outcome: The long-press on the note \"art_project_sketches_st16.md\" closed the pop-up menu that was previously open. The file path at the top changed to \"/storage/emulated/0 /Documents\", and the icons in the top bar were updated. The note itself does not appear to be selected. This action did not directly achieve the goal of selecting notes, but it changed the UI, presenting new elements to interact with, specifically a new three-dots menu icon at the top right.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen (coordinates [84, 945]). This action is predicted to open a context menu which might contain options like \\'Select All\\', \\'Select\\', or \\'Delete\\', which are relevant for selecting and deleting notes. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon successfully opened a pop-up menu. However, the menu options (\\'Import from device\\' and \\'Settings\\') do not provide any functionality for selecting or deleting notes. Therefore, while the action was executed as intended (opening the menu), it did not bring the agent closer to the goal of deleting notes. A different strategy is required to select the notes.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[320,495],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' at approximately [320, 495] to close the currently open pop-up menu. The pop-up menu is expected to disappear, returning to the file list view. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the note \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' successfully closed the pop-up menu that was previously open. The screen now shows the list of files without the menu overlay. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by clearing the screen for the next interaction, which is to try and select notes for deletion.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[868,615],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Markor app icon, which is currently visible in the app drawer. The icon is located near the text \\'Markor\\'. The tap coordinates are [868, 615]. This action is predicted to open the Markor application. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Markor app icon successfully opened the Markor application. The screen changed from the app drawer to the Markor app\\'s main interface, which displays a list of files that appear to be notes. This action has brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction by completing the first subgoal. The Markor app is now open and ready for further interaction to delete the notes.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen (coordinates [84, 945]). This action is predicted to open a context menu which might contain an option to \\'Select All\\' notes. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon successfully opened a context menu. However, the menu options (\\'Import from device\\' and \\'Settings\\') do not include a \\'Select All\\' feature or any other option relevant to selecting notes for deletion. While the action itself was executed correctly (a menu appeared), it did not directly bring the agent closer to selecting all notes. A different approach is needed, such as long-pressing a note.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[259,459],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the note titled \"art_project_sketches_st16.md\" (coordinates [259, 459]). This action is predicted to activate a selection mode, allowing for the selection of multiple notes for deletion. The menu currently open on the right side of the screen might close as a result of this interaction. Actual Outcome: The long-press on the note \"art_project_sketches_st16.md\" closed the pop-up menu that was previously open. The file path at the top changed to \"/storage/emulated/0 /Documents\", and the icons in the top bar were updated. The note itself does not appear to be selected. This action did not directly achieve the goal of selecting notes, but it changed the UI, presenting new elements to interact with, specifically a new three-dots menu icon at the top right.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen (coordinates [84, 945]). This action is predicted to open a context menu which might contain options like \\'Select All\\', \\'Select\\', or \\'Delete\\', which are relevant for selecting and deleting notes. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon successfully opened a pop-up menu. However, the menu options (\\'Import from device\\' and \\'Settings\\') do not provide any functionality for selecting or deleting notes. Therefore, while the action was executed as intended (opening the menu), it did not bring the agent closer to the goal of deleting notes. A different strategy is required to select the notes.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[320,495],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' at approximately [320, 495] to close the currently open pop-up menu. The pop-up menu is expected to disappear, returning to the file list view. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the note \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' successfully closed the pop-up menu that was previously open. The screen now shows the list of files without the menu overlay. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by clearing the screen for the next interaction, which is to try and select notes for deletion.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 6: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[258,458],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the note \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' located at approximately [258, 458]. This is an attempt to activate selection mode for the notes. It is predicted that this action might highlight the selected note and/or bring up a contextual menu with options like \\'Select All\\' or \\'Delete\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Find and Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen is visible, OR it\\'s determined that Markor is not installed. `MarkorAppAccessibility` is updated to \\'Markor Opened\\' or \\'Markor Not Found\\'.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The app drawer was opened, and the Markor app icon was tapped.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

While the action itself was executed correctly (a menu appeared), it did not directly bring the agent closer to selecting all notes. A different approach is needed, such as long-pressing a note.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[259,459],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the note titled \"art_project_sketches_st16.md\" (coordinates [259, 459]). This action is predicted to activate a selection mode, allowing for the selection of multiple notes for deletion. The menu currently open on the right side of the screen might close as a result of this interaction. Actual Outcome: The long-press on the note \"art_project_sketches_st16.md\" closed the pop-up menu that was previously open. The file path at the top changed to \"/storage/emulated/0 /Documents\", and the icons in the top bar were updated. The note itself does not appear to be selected. This action did not directly achieve the goal of selecting notes, but it changed the UI, presenting new elements to interact with, specifically a new three-dots menu icon at the top right.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen (coordinates [84, 945]). This action is predicted to open a context menu which might contain options like \\'Select All\\', \\'Select\\', or \\'Delete\\', which are relevant for selecting and deleting notes. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon successfully opened a pop-up menu. However, the menu options (\\'Import from device\\' and \\'Settings\\') do not provide any functionality for selecting or deleting notes. Therefore, while the action was executed as intended (opening the menu), it did not bring the agent closer to the goal of deleting notes. A different strategy is required to select the notes.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[320,495],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' at approximately [320, 495] to close the currently open pop-up menu. The pop-up menu is expected to disappear, returning to the file list view. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the note \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' successfully closed the pop-up menu that was previously open. The screen now shows the list of files without the menu overlay. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by clearing the screen for the next interaction, which is to try and select notes for deletion.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[258,458],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the note \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' located at approximately [258, 458]. This is an attempt to activate selection mode for the notes. It is predicted that this action might highlight the selected note and/or bring up a contextual menu with options like \\'Select All\\' or \\'Delete\\'. Actual Outcome: The long-press on \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' successfully activated selection mode. The note is now selected (indicated by a red checkmark), and a new contextual action bar has appeared at the top of the screen. This bar contains icons for actions like delete (trash can), which is directly relevant to the user\\'s goal. This action has brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of selecting all notes.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen (coordinates [84, 945]). This action is predicted to open a context menu which might contain an option to \\'Select All\\' notes. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon successfully opened a context menu. However, the menu options (\\'Import from device\\' and \\'Settings\\') do not include a \\'Select All\\' feature or any other option relevant to selecting notes for deletion. While the action itself was executed correctly (a menu appeared), it did not directly bring the agent closer to selecting all notes. A different approach is needed, such as long-pressing a note.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[259,459],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the note titled \"art_project_sketches_st16.md\" (coordinates [259, 459]). This action is predicted to activate a selection mode, allowing for the selection of multiple notes for deletion. The menu currently open on the right side of the screen might close as a result of this interaction. Actual Outcome: The long-press on the note \"art_project_sketches_st16.md\" closed the pop-up menu that was previously open. The file path at the top changed to \"/storage/emulated/0 /Documents\", and the icons in the top bar were updated. The note itself does not appear to be selected. This action did not directly achieve the goal of selecting notes, but it changed the UI, presenting new elements to interact with, specifically a new three-dots menu icon at the top right.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen (coordinates [84, 945]). This action is predicted to open a context menu which might contain options like \\'Select All\\', \\'Select\\', or \\'Delete\\', which are relevant for selecting and deleting notes. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon successfully opened a pop-up menu. However, the menu options (\\'Import from device\\' and \\'Settings\\') do not provide any functionality for selecting or deleting notes. Therefore, while the action was executed as intended (opening the menu), it did not bring the agent closer to the goal of deleting notes. A different strategy is required to select the notes.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[320,495],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' at approximately [320, 495] to close the currently open pop-up menu. The pop-up menu is expected to disappear, returning to the file list view. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the note \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' successfully closed the pop-up menu that was previously open. The screen now shows the list of files without the menu overlay. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by clearing the screen for the next interaction, which is to try and select notes for deletion.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[258,458],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the note \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' located at approximately [258, 458]. This is an attempt to activate selection mode for the notes. It is predicted that this action might highlight the selected note and/or bring up a contextual menu with options like \\'Select All\\' or \\'Delete\\'. Actual Outcome: The long-press on \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' successfully activated selection mode. The note is now selected (indicated by a red checkmark), and a new contextual action bar has appeared at the top of the screen. This bar contains icons for actions like delete (trash can), which is directly relevant to the user\\'s goal. This action has brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of selecting all notes.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 7: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen (within bounding box [67, 903, 100, 984]). This action is predicted to open a context menu which might contain a \\'Select All\\' option. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Find and Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen is visible, OR it\\'s determined that Markor is not installed. `MarkorAppAccessibility` is updated to \\'Markor Opened\\' or \\'Markor Not Found\\'.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The app drawer was opened, and the Markor app icon was tapped.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[259,459],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the note titled \"art_project_sketches_st16.md\" (coordinates [259, 459]). This action is predicted to activate a selection mode, allowing for the selection of multiple notes for deletion. The menu currently open on the right side of the screen might close as a result of this interaction. Actual Outcome: The long-press on the note \"art_project_sketches_st16.md\" closed the pop-up menu that was previously open. The file path at the top changed to \"/storage/emulated/0 /Documents\", and the icons in the top bar were updated. The note itself does not appear to be selected. This action did not directly achieve the goal of selecting notes, but it changed the UI, presenting new elements to interact with, specifically a new three-dots menu icon at the top right.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen (coordinates [84, 945]). This action is predicted to open a context menu which might contain options like \\'Select All\\', \\'Select\\', or \\'Delete\\', which are relevant for selecting and deleting notes. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon successfully opened a pop-up menu. However, the menu options (\\'Import from device\\' and \\'Settings\\') do not provide any functionality for selecting or deleting notes. Therefore, while the action was executed as intended (opening the menu), it did not bring the agent closer to the goal of deleting notes. A different strategy is required to select the notes.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[320,495],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' at approximately [320, 495] to close the currently open pop-up menu. The pop-up menu is expected to disappear, returning to the file list view. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the note \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' successfully closed the pop-up menu that was previously open. The screen now shows the list of files without the menu overlay. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by clearing the screen for the next interaction, which is to try and select notes for deletion.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[258,458],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the note \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' located at approximately [258, 458]. This is an attempt to activate selection mode for the notes. It is predicted that this action might highlight the selected note and/or bring up a contextual menu with options like \\'Select All\\' or \\'Delete\\'. Actual Outcome: The long-press on \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' successfully activated selection mode. The note is now selected (indicated by a red checkmark), and a new contextual action bar has appeared at the top of the screen. This bar contains icons for actions like delete (trash can), which is directly relevant to the user\\'s goal. This action has brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of selecting all notes.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen (within bounding box [67, 903, 100, 984]). This action is predicted to open a context menu which might contain a \\'Select All\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon (located at approximately [83, 943] in the contextual action bar) successfully opened a pop-up menu. The menu displays the options: \\'Clipboard\\', \\'Move\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Create shortcut\\', and \\'Share\\'. None of these options is \\'Select All\\'. This means the attempt to find a \\'Select All\\' option via this menu was unsuccessful. The note \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' remains selected. The pop-up menu now needs to be closed to continue with the task of selecting other notes.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 42, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.40\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [75, 608, 97, 783], \\'text\\': \\'Clipboard\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [128, 608, 146, 710], \\'text\\': \\'Move\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [144, 140, 167, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Istorage/emulated/0/4\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [183, 143, 223, 449], \\'text\\': \\'app 10/15/2023, 15.35\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [232, 608, 251, 885], \\'text\\': \\'Create shortcut\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [235, 139, 283, 525], \\'text\\': \\'art_project_sketch 10/15/2023, 15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [285, 606, 304, 716], \\'text\\': \\'Share\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [298, 141, 343, 488], \\'text\\': \\'backup_favorite_ 10/15/2023, 15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [358, 140, 404, 865], \\'text\\': \\'final_budget_home_renovation.md 10/15/2023, 15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [950, 85, 966, 163], \\'text\\': \\'Files\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [951, 332, 966, 417], \\'text\\': \\'To-Do\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 553, 966, 699], \\'text\\': \\'QuickNote\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 840, 966, 913], \\'text\\': \\'More\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 602, 204, 706], \\'text\\': \\'Copy\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [833, 818, 896, 972]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [111, 515, 165, 997]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 493, 974, 759]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [164, 513, 217, 998]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 514, 112, 996]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [216, 514, 268, 996]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 0, 974, 257]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 254, 974, 498]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [356, 0, 417, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [265, 511, 322, 998]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [175, 0, 235, 536]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [116, 0, 175, 535]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [914, 834, 973, 915]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 819, 36, 900]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 904, 36, 946]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 195, 37, 244]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [985, 363, 1000, 634]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[259,459],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the note titled \"art_project_sketches_st16.md\" (coordinates [259, 459]). This action is predicted to activate a selection mode, allowing for the selection of multiple notes for deletion. The menu currently open on the right side of the screen might close as a result of this interaction. Actual Outcome: The long-press on the note \"art_project_sketches_st16.md\" closed the pop-up menu that was previously open. The file path at the top changed to \"/storage/emulated/0 /Documents\", and the icons in the top bar were updated. The note itself does not appear to be selected. This action did not directly achieve the goal of selecting notes, but it changed the UI, presenting new elements to interact with, specifically a new three-dots menu icon at the top right.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen (coordinates [84, 945]). This action is predicted to open a context menu which might contain options like \\'Select All\\', \\'Select\\', or \\'Delete\\', which are relevant for selecting and deleting notes. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon successfully opened a pop-up menu. However, the menu options (\\'Import from device\\' and \\'Settings\\') do not provide any functionality for selecting or deleting notes. Therefore, while the action was executed as intended (opening the menu), it did not bring the agent closer to the goal of deleting notes. A different strategy is required to select the notes.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[320,495],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' at approximately [320, 495] to close the currently open pop-up menu. The pop-up menu is expected to disappear, returning to the file list view. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the note \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' successfully closed the pop-up menu that was previously open. The screen now shows the list of files without the menu overlay. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by clearing the screen for the next interaction, which is to try and select notes for deletion.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[258,458],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the note \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' located at approximately [258, 458]. This is an attempt to activate selection mode for the notes. It is predicted that this action might highlight the selected note and/or bring up a contextual menu with options like \\'Select All\\' or \\'Delete\\'. Actual Outcome: The long-press on \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' successfully activated selection mode. The note is now selected (indicated by a red checkmark), and a new contextual action bar has appeared at the top of the screen. This bar contains icons for actions like delete (trash can), which is directly relevant to the user\\'s goal. This action has brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of selecting all notes.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen (within bounding box [67, 903, 100, 984]). This action is predicted to open a context menu which might contain a \\'Select All\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon (located at approximately [83, 943] in the contextual action bar) successfully opened a pop-up menu. The menu displays the options: \\'Clipboard\\', \\'Move\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Create shortcut\\', and \\'Share\\'. None of these options is \\'Select All\\'. This means the attempt to find a \\'Select All\\' option via this menu was unsuccessful. The note \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' remains selected. The pop-up menu now needs to be closed to continue with the task of selecting other notes.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 8: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[320,314],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' (around [320, 314]). This is predicted to close the currently open pop-up menu and select the tapped note. The note \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' should remain selected. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Find and Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen is visible, OR it\\'s determined that Markor is not installed. `MarkorAppAccessibility` is updated to \\'Markor Opened\\' or \\'Markor Not Found\\'.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The app drawer was opened, and the Markor app icon was tapped.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen (coordinates [84, 945]). This action is predicted to open a context menu which might contain options like \\'Select All\\', \\'Select\\', or \\'Delete\\', which are relevant for selecting and deleting notes. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon successfully opened a pop-up menu. However, the menu options (\\'Import from device\\' and \\'Settings\\') do not provide any functionality for selecting or deleting notes. Therefore, while the action was executed as intended (opening the menu), it did not bring the agent closer to the goal of deleting notes. A different strategy is required to select the notes.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[320,495],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' at approximately [320, 495] to close the currently open pop-up menu. The pop-up menu is expected to disappear, returning to the file list view. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the note \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' successfully closed the pop-up menu that was previously open. The screen now shows the list of files without the menu overlay. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by clearing the screen for the next interaction, which is to try and select notes for deletion.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[258,458],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the note \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' located at approximately [258, 458]. This is an attempt to activate selection mode for the notes. It is predicted that this action might highlight the selected note and/or bring up a contextual menu with options like \\'Select All\\' or \\'Delete\\'. Actual Outcome: The long-press on \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' successfully activated selection mode. The note is now selected (indicated by a red checkmark), and a new contextual action bar has appeared at the top of the screen. This bar contains icons for actions like delete (trash can), which is directly relevant to the user\\'s goal. This action has brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of selecting all notes.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen (within bounding box [67, 903, 100, 984]). This action is predicted to open a context menu which might contain a \\'Select All\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon (located at approximately [83, 943] in the contextual action bar) successfully opened a pop-up menu. The menu displays the options: \\'Clipboard\\', \\'Move\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Create shortcut\\', and \\'Share\\'. None of these options is \\'Select All\\'. This means the attempt to find a \\'Select All\\' option via this menu was unsuccessful. The note \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' remains selected. The pop-up menu now needs to be closed to continue with the task of selecting other notes.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[320,314],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' (around [320, 314]). This is predicted to close the currently open pop-up menu and select the tapped note. The note \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' should remain selected. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' at [320, 314] successfully closed the pop-up menu that was previously open. However, it did not result in the selection of \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\'. The note \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' remains selected, and the contextual action bar is still visible, indicating that selection mode is active. The action partially achieved its goal by closing the menu but failed to select the intended note. To progress, the agent needs to tap on the unselected notes to add them to the selection.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 41, 36, 133], \\'text\\': \\'15.41\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [74, 636, 95, 694], \\'text\\': \\'AI\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [143, 139, 167, 689], \\'text\\': \\'Istorage/emulated/0 /Documents\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [183, 143, 223, 449], \\'text\\': \\'app 10/15/2023, 15.35\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [234, 140, 283, 777], \\'text\\': \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md 10/15/2023, 15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [298, 142, 343, 849], \\'text\\': \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md 10/15/2023, 15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [358, 140, 404, 865], \\'text\\': \\'final_budget_home_renovation.md 10/15/2023, 15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [950, 85, 966, 163], \\'text\\': \\'Files\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [951, 332, 966, 417], \\'text\\': \\'To-Do\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 553, 966, 699], \\'text\\': \\'QuickNote\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 840, 966, 913], \\'text\\': \\'More\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [833, 819, 896, 969]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 494, 974, 758]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 0, 974, 257]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 254, 974, 499]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 903, 100, 984]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 813, 101, 894]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [13, 822, 39, 899]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 194, 38, 241]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 836, 972, 914]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 711, 115, 804]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 139, 36, 189]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 618, 103, 707]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 905, 37, 943]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [984, 363, 1000, 634]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 522, 114, 608]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen (coordinates [84, 945]). This action is predicted to open a context menu which might contain options like \\'Select All\\', \\'Select\\', or \\'Delete\\', which are relevant for selecting and deleting notes. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon successfully opened a pop-up menu. However, the menu options (\\'Import from device\\' and \\'Settings\\') do not provide any functionality for selecting or deleting notes. Therefore, while the action was executed as intended (opening the menu), it did not bring the agent closer to the goal of deleting notes. A different strategy is required to select the notes.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[320,495],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' at approximately [320, 495] to close the currently open pop-up menu. The pop-up menu is expected to disappear, returning to the file list view. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the note \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' successfully closed the pop-up menu that was previously open. The screen now shows the list of files without the menu overlay. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by clearing the screen for the next interaction, which is to try and select notes for deletion.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[258,458],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the note \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' located at approximately [258, 458]. This is an attempt to activate selection mode for the notes. It is predicted that this action might highlight the selected note and/or bring up a contextual menu with options like \\'Select All\\' or \\'Delete\\'. Actual Outcome: The long-press on \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' successfully activated selection mode. The note is now selected (indicated by a red checkmark), and a new contextual action bar has appeared at the top of the screen. This bar contains icons for actions like delete (trash can), which is directly relevant to the user\\'s goal. This action has brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of selecting all notes.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen (within bounding box [67, 903, 100, 984]). This action is predicted to open a context menu which might contain a \\'Select All\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon (located at approximately [83, 943] in the contextual action bar) successfully opened a pop-up menu. The menu displays the options: \\'Clipboard\\', \\'Move\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Create shortcut\\', and \\'Share\\'. None of these options is \\'Select All\\'. This means the attempt to find a \\'Select All\\' option via this menu was unsuccessful. The note \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' remains selected. The pop-up menu now needs to be closed to continue with the task of selecting other notes.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[320,314],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' (around [320, 314]). This is predicted to close the currently open pop-up menu and select the tapped note. The note \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' should remain selected. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' at [320, 314] successfully closed the pop-up menu that was previously open. However, it did not result in the selection of \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\'. The note \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' remains selected, and the contextual action bar is still visible, indicating that selection mode is active. The action partially achieved its goal by closing the menu but failed to select the intended note. To progress, the agent needs to tap on the unselected notes to add them to the selection.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 9: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[320,495],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' (center [320, 495]) to select it. It is currently unselected. It is predicted that this action will add \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' to the current selection, and it will also get a red checkmark. \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' should remain selected. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Find and Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen is visible, OR it\\'s determined that Markor is not installed. `MarkorAppAccessibility` is updated to \\'Markor Opened\\' or \\'Markor Not Found\\'.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The app drawer was opened, and the Markor app icon was tapped.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[320,495],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' at approximately [320, 495] to close the currently open pop-up menu. The pop-up menu is expected to disappear, returning to the file list view. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the note \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' successfully closed the pop-up menu that was previously open. The screen now shows the list of files without the menu overlay. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by clearing the screen for the next interaction, which is to try and select notes for deletion.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[258,458],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the note \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' located at approximately [258, 458]. This is an attempt to activate selection mode for the notes. It is predicted that this action might highlight the selected note and/or bring up a contextual menu with options like \\'Select All\\' or \\'Delete\\'. Actual Outcome: The long-press on \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' successfully activated selection mode. The note is now selected (indicated by a red checkmark), and a new contextual action bar has appeared at the top of the screen. This bar contains icons for actions like delete (trash can), which is directly relevant to the user\\'s goal. This action has brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of selecting all notes.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen (within bounding box [67, 903, 100, 984]). This action is predicted to open a context menu which might contain a \\'Select All\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon (located at approximately [83, 943] in the contextual action bar) successfully opened a pop-up menu. The menu displays the options: \\'Clipboard\\', \\'Move\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Create shortcut\\', and \\'Share\\'. None of these options is \\'Select All\\'. This means the attempt to find a \\'Select All\\' option via this menu was unsuccessful. The note \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' remains selected. The pop-up menu now needs to be closed to continue with the task of selecting other notes.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[320,314],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' (around [320, 314]). This is predicted to close the currently open pop-up menu and select the tapped note. The note \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' should remain selected. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' at [320, 314] successfully closed the pop-up menu that was previously open. However, it did not result in the selection of \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\'. The note \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' remains selected, and the contextual action bar is still visible, indicating that selection mode is active. The action partially achieved its goal by closing the menu but failed to select the intended note. To progress, the agent needs to tap on the unselected notes to add them to the selection.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[320,495],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' (center [320, 495]) to select it. It is currently unselected. It is predicted that this action will add \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' to the current selection, and it will also get a red checkmark. \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' should remain selected. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' (at approximately [320, 495]) successfully selected the note. This is evidenced by the appearance of a red checkmark next to \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\'. The note \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' remains selected. The contextual action bar at the top, indicating selection mode, is still visible. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of selecting all notes.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 43, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.42\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [143, 139, 167, 689], \\'text\\': \\'Istorage/emulated/0 /Documents\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [183, 143, 223, 449], \\'text\\': \\'.app 10/15/2023, 15.35\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [234, 140, 283, 777], \\'text\\': \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md 10/15/2023, 15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [298, 142, 343, 849], \\'text\\': \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md 10/15/2023, 15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [358, 140, 404, 865], \\'text\\': \\'final_budget_home_renovation.md 10/15/2023, 15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [950, 85, 966, 163], \\'text\\': \\'Files\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [951, 332, 966, 417], \\'text\\': \\'To-Do\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 553, 966, 699], \\'text\\': \\'QuickNote\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 840, 966, 913], \\'text\\': \\'More\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [833, 819, 896, 969]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 494, 974, 758]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 0, 974, 257]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 254, 974, 498]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 813, 113, 896]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 836, 972, 914]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 822, 36, 901]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 194, 38, 241]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [174, 2, 235, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [984, 363, 1000, 634]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 905, 37, 942]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [116, 3, 183, 1000]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[320,495],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' at approximately [320, 495] to close the currently open pop-up menu. The pop-up menu is expected to disappear, returning to the file list view. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the note \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' successfully closed the pop-up menu that was previously open. The screen now shows the list of files without the menu overlay. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by clearing the screen for the next interaction, which is to try and select notes for deletion.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[258,458],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the note \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' located at approximately [258, 458]. This is an attempt to activate selection mode for the notes. It is predicted that this action might highlight the selected note and/or bring up a contextual menu with options like \\'Select All\\' or \\'Delete\\'. Actual Outcome: The long-press on \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' successfully activated selection mode. The note is now selected (indicated by a red checkmark), and a new contextual action bar has appeared at the top of the screen. This bar contains icons for actions like delete (trash can), which is directly relevant to the user\\'s goal. This action has brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of selecting all notes.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen (within bounding box [67, 903, 100, 984]). This action is predicted to open a context menu which might contain a \\'Select All\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon (located at approximately [83, 943] in the contextual action bar) successfully opened a pop-up menu. The menu displays the options: \\'Clipboard\\', \\'Move\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Create shortcut\\', and \\'Share\\'. None of these options is \\'Select All\\'. This means the attempt to find a \\'Select All\\' option via this menu was unsuccessful. The note \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' remains selected. The pop-up menu now needs to be closed to continue with the task of selecting other notes.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[320,314],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' (around [320, 314]). This is predicted to close the currently open pop-up menu and select the tapped note. The note \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' should remain selected. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' at [320, 314] successfully closed the pop-up menu that was previously open. However, it did not result in the selection of \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\'. The note \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' remains selected, and the contextual action bar is still visible, indicating that selection mode is active. The action partially achieved its goal by closing the menu but failed to select the intended note. To progress, the agent needs to tap on the unselected notes to add them to the selection.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[320,495],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' (center [320, 495]) to select it. It is currently unselected. It is predicted that this action will add \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' to the current selection, and it will also get a red checkmark. \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' should remain selected. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' (at approximately [320, 495]) successfully selected the note. This is evidenced by the appearance of a red checkmark next to \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\'. The note \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' remains selected. The contextual action bar at the top, indicating selection mode, is still visible. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of selecting all notes.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 10: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[381,502],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'final_budget_home_renovation.md\\' (center [381, 502]) to select it. It is currently unselected. It is predicted that this action will add \\'final_budget_home_renovation.md\\' to the current selection, and it will also get a red checkmark. The other two notes should remain selected. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Find and Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen is visible, OR it\\'s determined that Markor is not installed. `MarkorAppAccessibility` is updated to \\'Markor Opened\\' or \\'Markor Not Found\\'.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The app drawer was opened, and the Markor app icon was tapped.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[258,458],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the note \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' located at approximately [258, 458]. This is an attempt to activate selection mode for the notes. It is predicted that this action might highlight the selected note and/or bring up a contextual menu with options like \\'Select All\\' or \\'Delete\\'. Actual Outcome: The long-press on \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' successfully activated selection mode. The note is now selected (indicated by a red checkmark), and a new contextual action bar has appeared at the top of the screen. This bar contains icons for actions like delete (trash can), which is directly relevant to the user\\'s goal. This action has brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of selecting all notes.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen (within bounding box [67, 903, 100, 984]). This action is predicted to open a context menu which might contain a \\'Select All\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon (located at approximately [83, 943] in the contextual action bar) successfully opened a pop-up menu. The menu displays the options: \\'Clipboard\\', \\'Move\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Create shortcut\\', and \\'Share\\'. None of these options is \\'Select All\\'. This means the attempt to find a \\'Select All\\' option via this menu was unsuccessful. The note \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' remains selected. The pop-up menu now needs to be closed to continue with the task of selecting other notes.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[320,314],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' (around [320, 314]). This is predicted to close the currently open pop-up menu and select the tapped note. The note \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' should remain selected. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' at [320, 314] successfully closed the pop-up menu that was previously open. However, it did not result in the selection of \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\'. The note \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' remains selected, and the contextual action bar is still visible, indicating that selection mode is active. The action partially achieved its goal by closing the menu but failed to select the intended note. To progress, the agent needs to tap on the unselected notes to add them to the selection.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[320,495],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' (center [320, 495]) to select it. It is currently unselected. It is predicted that this action will add \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' to the current selection, and it will also get a red checkmark. \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' should remain selected. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' (at approximately [320, 495]) successfully selected the note. This is evidenced by the appearance of a red checkmark next to \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\'. The note \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' remains selected. The contextual action bar at the top, indicating selection mode, is still visible. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of selecting all notes.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[381,502],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'final_budget_home_renovation.md\\' (center [381, 502]) to select it. It is currently unselected. It is predicted that this action will add \\'final_budget_home_renovation.md\\' to the current selection, and it will also get a red checkmark. The other two notes should remain selected. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'final_budget_home_renovation.md\\' (at approximately [381, 502]) successfully selected the note. This is evidenced by the appearance of a red checkmark next to \\'final_budget_home_renovation.md\\'. The previously selected notes, \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' and \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\', remain selected. The contextual action bar at the top, indicating selection mode, is still visible. This action has successfully selected all visible notes, thereby completing the active Subgoal 2.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right.

For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[258,458],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the note \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' located at approximately [258, 458]. This is an attempt to activate selection mode for the notes. It is predicted that this action might highlight the selected note and/or bring up a contextual menu with options like \\'Select All\\' or \\'Delete\\'. Actual Outcome: The long-press on \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' successfully activated selection mode. The note is now selected (indicated by a red checkmark), and a new contextual action bar has appeared at the top of the screen. This bar contains icons for actions like delete (trash can), which is directly relevant to the user\\'s goal. This action has brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of selecting all notes.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen (within bounding box [67, 903, 100, 984]). This action is predicted to open a context menu which might contain a \\'Select All\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon (located at approximately [83, 943] in the contextual action bar) successfully opened a pop-up menu. The menu displays the options: \\'Clipboard\\', \\'Move\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Create shortcut\\', and \\'Share\\'. None of these options is \\'Select All\\'. This means the attempt to find a \\'Select All\\' option via this menu was unsuccessful. The note \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' remains selected. The pop-up menu now needs to be closed to continue with the task of selecting other notes.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[320,314],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' (around [320, 314]). This is predicted to close the currently open pop-up menu and select the tapped note. The note \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' should remain selected. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' at [320, 314] successfully closed the pop-up menu that was previously open. However, it did not result in the selection of \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\'. The note \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' remains selected, and the contextual action bar is still visible, indicating that selection mode is active. The action partially achieved its goal by closing the menu but failed to select the intended note. To progress, the agent needs to tap on the unselected notes to add them to the selection.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[320,495],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' (center [320, 495]) to select it. It is currently unselected. It is predicted that this action will add \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' to the current selection, and it will also get a red checkmark. \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' should remain selected. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' (at approximately [320, 495]) successfully selected the note. This is evidenced by the appearance of a red checkmark next to \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\'. The note \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' remains selected. The contextual action bar at the top, indicating selection mode, is still visible. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of selecting all notes.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[381,502],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'final_budget_home_renovation.md\\' (center [381, 502]) to select it. It is currently unselected. It is predicted that this action will add \\'final_budget_home_renovation.md\\' to the current selection, and it will also get a red checkmark. The other two notes should remain selected. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'final_budget_home_renovation.md\\' (at approximately [381, 502]) successfully selected the note. This is evidenced by the appearance of a red checkmark next to \\'final_budget_home_renovation.md\\'. The previously selected notes, \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' and \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\', remain selected. The contextual action bar at the top, indicating selection mode, is still visible. This action has successfully selected all visible notes, thereby completing the active Subgoal 2.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 11: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,854],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the trash can icon located in the contextual action bar at the top right of the screen (center at approximately [89, 854]). This icon is within the bounding box [66, 813, 113, 895]. This action is predicted to initiate the deletion of the three selected notes. A confirmation dialog might appear after this tap. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Find and Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen is visible, OR it\\'s determined that Markor is not installed. `MarkorAppAccessibility` is updated to \\'Markor Opened\\' or \\'Markor Not Found\\'.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The app drawer was opened, and the Markor app icon was tapped.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen (within bounding box [67, 903, 100, 984]). This action is predicted to open a context menu which might contain a \\'Select All\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon (located at approximately [83, 943] in the contextual action bar) successfully opened a pop-up menu. The menu displays the options: \\'Clipboard\\', \\'Move\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Create shortcut\\', and \\'Share\\'. None of these options is \\'Select All\\'. This means the attempt to find a \\'Select All\\' option via this menu was unsuccessful. The note \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' remains selected. The pop-up menu now needs to be closed to continue with the task of selecting other notes.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[320,314],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' (around [320, 314]). This is predicted to close the currently open pop-up menu and select the tapped note. The note \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' should remain selected. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' at [320, 314] successfully closed the pop-up menu that was previously open. However, it did not result in the selection of \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\'. The note \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' remains selected, and the contextual action bar is still visible, indicating that selection mode is active. The action partially achieved its goal by closing the menu but failed to select the intended note. To progress, the agent needs to tap on the unselected notes to add them to the selection.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[320,495],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' (center [320, 495]) to select it. It is currently unselected. It is predicted that this action will add \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' to the current selection, and it will also get a red checkmark. \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' should remain selected. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' (at approximately [320, 495]) successfully selected the note. This is evidenced by the appearance of a red checkmark next to \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\'. The note \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' remains selected. The contextual action bar at the top, indicating selection mode, is still visible. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of selecting all notes.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[381,502],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'final_budget_home_renovation.md\\' (center [381, 502]) to select it. It is currently unselected. It is predicted that this action will add \\'final_budget_home_renovation.md\\' to the current selection, and it will also get a red checkmark. The other two notes should remain selected. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'final_budget_home_renovation.md\\' (at approximately [381, 502]) successfully selected the note. This is evidenced by the appearance of a red checkmark next to \\'final_budget_home_renovation.md\\'. The previously selected notes, \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' and \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\', remain selected. The contextual action bar at the top, indicating selection mode, is still visible. This action has successfully selected all visible notes, thereby completing the active Subgoal 2.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,854],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the trash can icon located in the contextual action bar at the top right of the screen (center at approximately [89, 854]). This icon is within the bounding box [66, 813, 113, 895]. This action is predicted to initiate the deletion of the three selected notes. A confirmation dialog might appear after this tap. Actual Outcome: The tap on the trash can icon (at approximately [89, 854]) successfully initiated the deletion process by bringing up a \\'Confirm Delete\\' dialog. The dialog lists the three selected notes (\\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\', \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\', \\'final_budget_home_renovation.md\\') and asks \\'Do you really want to delete this Documents?\\'. It provides \\'CANCEL\\' and \\'OK\\' buttons. This action moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to confirm the deletion.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located at the top right of the screen (within bounding box [67, 903, 100, 984]). This action is predicted to open a context menu which might contain a \\'Select All\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon (located at approximately [83, 943] in the contextual action bar) successfully opened a pop-up menu. The menu displays the options: \\'Clipboard\\', \\'Move\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Create shortcut\\', and \\'Share\\'. None of these options is \\'Select All\\'. This means the attempt to find a \\'Select All\\' option via this menu was unsuccessful. The note \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' remains selected. The pop-up menu now needs to be closed to continue with the task of selecting other notes.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[320,314],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' (around [320, 314]). This is predicted to close the currently open pop-up menu and select the tapped note. The note \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' should remain selected. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' at [320, 314] successfully closed the pop-up menu that was previously open. However, it did not result in the selection of \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\'. The note \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' remains selected, and the contextual action bar is still visible, indicating that selection mode is active. The action partially achieved its goal by closing the menu but failed to select the intended note. To progress, the agent needs to tap on the unselected notes to add them to the selection.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[320,495],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' (center [320, 495]) to select it. It is currently unselected. It is predicted that this action will add \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' to the current selection, and it will also get a red checkmark. \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' should remain selected. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' (at approximately [320, 495]) successfully selected the note. This is evidenced by the appearance of a red checkmark next to \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\'. The note \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' remains selected. The contextual action bar at the top, indicating selection mode, is still visible. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of selecting all notes.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[381,502],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'final_budget_home_renovation.md\\' (center [381, 502]) to select it. It is currently unselected. It is predicted that this action will add \\'final_budget_home_renovation.md\\' to the current selection, and it will also get a red checkmark. The other two notes should remain selected. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'final_budget_home_renovation.md\\' (at approximately [381, 502]) successfully selected the note. This is evidenced by the appearance of a red checkmark next to \\'final_budget_home_renovation.md\\'. The previously selected notes, \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' and \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\', remain selected. The contextual action bar at the top, indicating selection mode, is still visible. This action has successfully selected all visible notes, thereby completing the active Subgoal 2.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,854],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the trash can icon located in the contextual action bar at the top right of the screen (center at approximately [89, 854]). This icon is within the bounding box [66, 813, 113, 895]. This action is predicted to initiate the deletion of the three selected notes. A confirmation dialog might appear after this tap. Actual Outcome: The tap on the trash can icon (at approximately [89, 854]) successfully initiated the deletion process by bringing up a \\'Confirm Delete\\' dialog. The dialog lists the three selected notes (\\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\', \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\', \\'final_budget_home_renovation.md\\') and asks \\'Do you really want to delete this Documents?\\'. It provides \\'CANCEL\\' and \\'OK\\' buttons. This action moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to confirm the deletion.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 12: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[680,745],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button in the \\'Confirm Delete\\' dialog. The \\'OK\\' button is located at the bottom right of the dialog (center approximately [680, 745]). This action is predicted to confirm the deletion of the selected notes, and the dialog will close. The notes should then disappear from the file list. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Find and Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen is visible, OR it\\'s determined that Markor is not installed. `MarkorAppAccessibility` is updated to \\'Markor Opened\\' or \\'Markor Not Found\\'.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The app drawer was opened, and the Markor app icon was tapped.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[320,314],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' (around [320, 314]). This is predicted to close the currently open pop-up menu and select the tapped note. The note \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' should remain selected. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' at [320, 314] successfully closed the pop-up menu that was previously open. However, it did not result in the selection of \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\'. The note \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' remains selected, and the contextual action bar is still visible, indicating that selection mode is active. The action partially achieved its goal by closing the menu but failed to select the intended note. To progress, the agent needs to tap on the unselected notes to add them to the selection.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[320,495],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' (center [320, 495]) to select it. It is currently unselected. It is predicted that this action will add \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' to the current selection, and it will also get a red checkmark. \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' should remain selected. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\' (at approximately [320, 495]) successfully selected the note. This is evidenced by the appearance of a red checkmark next to \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\'. The note \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' remains selected. The contextual action bar at the top, indicating selection mode, is still visible. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of selecting all notes.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[381,502],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the note \\'final_budget_home_renovation.md\\' (center [381, 502]) to select it. It is currently unselected. It is predicted that this action will add \\'final_budget_home_renovation.md\\' to the current selection, and it will also get a red checkmark. The other two notes should remain selected. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'final_budget_home_renovation.md\\' (at approximately [381, 502]) successfully selected the note. This is evidenced by the appearance of a red checkmark next to \\'final_budget_home_renovation.md\\'. The previously selected notes, \\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\' and \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\', remain selected. The contextual action bar at the top, indicating selection mode, is still visible. This action has successfully selected all visible notes, thereby completing the active Subgoal 2.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,854],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the trash can icon located in the contextual action bar at the top right of the screen (center at approximately [89, 854]). This icon is within the bounding box [66, 813, 113, 895]. This action is predicted to initiate the deletion of the three selected notes. A confirmation dialog might appear after this tap. Actual Outcome: The tap on the trash can icon (at approximately [89, 854]) successfully initiated the deletion process by bringing up a \\'Confirm Delete\\' dialog. The dialog lists the three selected notes (\\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\', \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\', \\'final_budget_home_renovation.md\\') and asks \\'Do you really want to delete this Documents?\\'. It provides \\'CANCEL\\' and \\'OK\\' buttons. This action moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to confirm the deletion.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[680,745],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button in the \\'Confirm Delete\\' dialog. The \\'OK\\' button is located at the bottom right of the dialog (center approximately [680, 745]). This action is predicted to confirm the deletion of the selected notes, and the dialog will close. The notes should then disappear from the file list. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'OK\\' button (at approximately [680, 745]) in the \\'Confirm Delete\\' dialog successfully confirmed the deletion of the three selected notes. The dialog closed, and the notes (\\'art_project_sketches_st16.md\\', \\'backup_favorite_book_quotes.md\\', \\'final_budget_home_renovation.md\\') have been removed from the file list in Markor. The action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully deleting the notes.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 42, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.43\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [74, 38, 96, 203], \\'text\\': \\'Markor\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 728, 95, 894], \\'text\\': \\'= Q\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [143, 139, 167, 689], \\'text\\': \\'Istorage/emulated/0 /Documents\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [183, 143, 224, 450], \\'text\\': \\'.app 10/15/2023, 15.35\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [950, 85, 966, 163], \\'text\\': \\'Files\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [951, 332, 966, 417], \\'text\\': \\'To-Do\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 553, 966, 699], \\'text\\': \\'QuickNote\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 840, 966, 913], \\'text\\': \\'More\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [833, 819, 896, 968]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 494, 973, 757]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 0, 974, 257]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 254, 974, 499]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 822, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 909, 101, 984]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 813, 104, 895]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 712, 99, 796]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 836, 972, 915]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 905, 36, 942]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 38, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 616, 109, 703]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [985, 363, 1000, 634]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 133, 37, 189]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right.
