Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [123, 46, 147, 306], \\'text\\': \\'Sun; Oct 15\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 336, 722, 431], \\'text\\': \\'Gmail\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 561, 722, 676], \\'text\\': \\'Photos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [704, 781, 722, 921], \\'text\\': \\'YouTube\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [775, 295, 872, 709], \\'text\\': \\'0 (9\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 72, 855, 232]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [788, 764, 856, 929]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 535, 858, 706]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [628, 536, 729, 694]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 299, 856, 466]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 764, 728, 927]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 299, 730, 463]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [900, 701, 948, 795]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [893, 801, 952, 924]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the Markor app is now visible and accessible.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 1: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is taken because the Markor app is not visible on the home screen, and opening the app drawer is the standard way to find and launch apps. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the Markor app is now visible and accessible.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[868,615],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Markor\\' app icon, which is located at approximately [868, 615] in the app drawer. This action is intended to open the Markor application. The Markor app icon is currently visible and ready to be tapped. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Markor app icon at [868, 615] successfully opened the Markor application. The screen changed from the app drawer to the Markor app\\'s main file browser interface. This action completed Subgoal 1 and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s request. The Markor app is now ready for the next step: creating a new note.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.35\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [74, 38, 96, 203], \\'text\\': \\'Markor\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 728, 95, 888], \\'text\\': \\'= Q\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [143, 139, 167, 689], \\'text\\': \\'Istorage/emulated/0 /Documents\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [183, 143, 224, 450], \\'text\\': \\'.app 10/15/2023, 15.35\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [950, 85, 966, 163], \\'text\\': \\'Files\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [951, 332, 966, 417], \\'text\\': \\'To-Do\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 553, 966, 699], \\'text\\': \\'QuickNote\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 840, 966, 913], \\'text\\': \\'More\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [833, 819, 896, 968]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 494, 974, 758]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 0, 974, 257]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 253, 974, 499]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 823, 37, 899]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 909, 101, 984]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 813, 104, 895]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 712, 99, 795]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 836, 972, 914]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 617, 111, 703]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 905, 37, 942]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 38, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [984, 362, 1000, 634]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is taken because the Markor app is not visible on the home screen, and opening the app drawer is the standard way to find and launch apps. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the Markor app is now visible and accessible.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

This action is intended to open the Markor application. The Markor app icon is currently visible and ready to be tapped. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Markor app icon at [868, 615] successfully opened the Markor application. The screen changed from the app drawer to the Markor app\\'s main file browser interface. This action completed Subgoal 1 and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s request. The Markor app is now ready for the next step: creating a new note.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 2: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is taken because the Markor app is not visible on the home screen, and opening the app drawer is the standard way to find and launch apps. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the Markor app is now visible and accessible.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[868,615],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Markor\\' app icon, which is located at approximately [868, 615] in the app drawer. This action is intended to open the Markor application. The Markor app icon is currently visible and ready to be tapped. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Markor app icon at [868, 615] successfully opened the Markor application. The screen changed from the app drawer to the Markor app\\'s main file browser interface. This action completed Subgoal 1 and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s request. The Markor app is now ready for the next step: creating a new note.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[864,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the red \\'+\\' button located at approximately [864, 893] in the bottom right corner of the screen. This action is intended to initiate the creation of a new note or file within the Markor app. The button is currently visible and ready to be tapped. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'+\\' button successfully opened a \\'Name\\' dialog box. This dialog allows for specifying the name, type, and template for a new file or folder. The default name is \\'my_note\\' and the default type is \\'Markdown\\', resulting in a \\'.md\\' extension. This action has brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 2, as the interface for naming the new note is now active.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nCreate a new note in Markor named fair_ant_XOdi.txt with the following text: Actions speak louder than words.. Share the entire content of the note with the phone number +13192815309 via SMS using Simple SMS Messenger\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 3 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen ([900, 500]) to the top-middle of the screen ([100, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is taken because the Markor app is not visible on the home screen, and opening the app drawer is the standard way to find and launch apps. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the Markor app is now visible and accessible.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[868,615],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Markor\\' app icon, which is located at approximately [868, 615] in the app drawer. This action is intended to open the Markor application. The Markor app icon is currently visible and ready to be tapped. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Markor app icon at [868, 615] successfully opened the Markor application. The screen changed from the app drawer to the Markor app\\'s main file browser interface. This action completed Subgoal 1 and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s request. The Markor app is now ready for the next step: creating a new note.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[864,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the red \\'+\\' button located at approximately [864, 893] in the bottom right corner of the screen. This action is intended to initiate the creation of a new note or file within the Markor app. The button is currently visible and ready to be tapped. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'+\\' button successfully opened a \\'Name\\' dialog box. This dialog allows for specifying the name, type, and template for a new file or folder. The default name is \\'my_note\\' and the default type is \\'Markdown\\', resulting in a \\'.md\\' extension. This action has brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 2, as the interface for naming the new note is now active.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 3: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[396,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the name input field, which currently shows \\'my_note\\'. The tap coordinates are approximately [396, 153], targeting the center of the text \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to focus the text field, allowing for deletion of the current text and input of the new filename. The field is currently displaying \\'my_note\\' and is underlined in red. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is taken because the Markor app is not visible on the home screen, and opening the app drawer is the standard way to find and launch apps. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the Markor app is now visible and accessible.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[868,615],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Markor\\' app icon, which is located at approximately [868, 615] in the app drawer. This action is intended to open the Markor application. The Markor app icon is currently visible and ready to be tapped. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Markor app icon at [868, 615] successfully opened the Markor application. The screen changed from the app drawer to the Markor app\\'s main file browser interface. This action completed Subgoal 1 and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s request. The Markor app is now ready for the next step: creating a new note.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[864,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the red \\'+\\' button located at approximately [864, 893] in the bottom right corner of the screen. This action is intended to initiate the creation of a new note or file within the Markor app. The button is currently visible and ready to be tapped. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'+\\' button successfully opened a \\'Name\\' dialog box. This dialog allows for specifying the name, type, and template for a new file or folder. The default name is \\'my_note\\' and the default type is \\'Markdown\\', resulting in a \\'.md\\' extension. This action has brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 2, as the interface for naming the new note is now active.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[396,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the name input field, which currently shows \\'my_note\\'. The tap coordinates are approximately [396, 153], targeting the center of the text \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to focus the text field, allowing for deletion of the current text and input of the new filename. The field is currently displaying \\'my_note\\' and is underlined in red. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the name input field (displaying \\'my_note\\') was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared. This prepares the field for editing, moving closer to completing Subgoal 2. The next action will be to delete the existing text.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.37\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [74, 38, 96, 203], \\'text\\': \\'Markor\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [143, 139, 167, 689], \\'text\\': \\'Istorage/emulated/0/Documents\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [183, 144, 223, 450], \\'text\\': \\'app 10/15/2023, 15.35\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [355, 75, 389, 229], \\'text\\': \\'Name my_note\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [369, 783, 387, 837], \\'text\\': \\'md\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [412, 75, 448, 284], \\'text\\': \\'Type Markdown\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [464, 75, 507, 273], \\'text\\': \\'Template Empty file\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [543, 90, 575, 606], \\'text\\': \\'Folder is created without file extension Files and folders are not overwritten\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [603, 94, 619, 225], \\'text\\': \\'FOLDER\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [603, 616, 618, 752], \\'text\\': \\'CANCEL\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [603, 829, 618, 882], \\'text\\': \\'OK\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [902, 85, 918, 163], \\'text\\': \\'Files\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [904, 333, 918, 417], \\'text\\': \\'To-Do\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [904, 553, 918, 699], \\'text\\': \\'QuickNote\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [903, 838, 920, 914], \\'text\\': \\'More\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [786, 819, 849, 968]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [865, 2, 927, 253]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [865, 252, 927, 495]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [865, 492, 926, 752]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 826, 35, 899]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [948, 649, 1000, 998]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 905, 35, 942]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 616, 111, 705]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [866, 837, 926, 914]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 906, 99, 985]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 36, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [364, 621, 392, 838]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 141, 36, 188]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 808, 107, 903]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 708, 99, 800]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [527, 53, 591, 931]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [410, 68, 470, 907]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [468, 60, 529, 909]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"1\", text=\"my_note\", resource-id=\"net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"net.gsantner.markor\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[84,851][663,959]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Share the entire content of the note with the phone number +13192815309 via SMS using Simple SMS Messenger\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 4 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen ([900, 500]) to the top-middle of the screen ([100, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is taken because the Markor app is not visible on the home screen, and opening the app drawer is the standard way to find and launch apps. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the Markor app is now visible and accessible.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[868,615],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Markor\\' app icon, which is located at approximately [868, 615] in the app drawer. This action is intended to open the Markor application. The Markor app icon is currently visible and ready to be tapped. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Markor app icon at [868, 615] successfully opened the Markor application. The screen changed from the app drawer to the Markor app\\'s main file browser interface. This action completed Subgoal 1 and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s request. The Markor app is now ready for the next step: creating a new note.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[864,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the red \\'+\\' button located at approximately [864, 893] in the bottom right corner of the screen. This action is intended to initiate the creation of a new note or file within the Markor app. The button is currently visible and ready to be tapped. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'+\\' button successfully opened a \\'Name\\' dialog box. This dialog allows for specifying the name, type, and template for a new file or folder. The default name is \\'my_note\\' and the default type is \\'Markdown\\', resulting in a \\'.md\\' extension. This action has brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 2, as the interface for naming the new note is now active.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[396,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the name input field, which currently shows \\'my_note\\'. The tap coordinates are approximately [396, 153], targeting the center of the text \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to focus the text field, allowing for deletion of the current text and input of the new filename. The field is currently displaying \\'my_note\\' and is underlined in red. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the name input field (displaying \\'my_note\\') was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared. This prepares the field for editing, moving closer to completing Subgoal 2. The next action will be to delete the existing text.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 4: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the focused name input field. The field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. After this action, the name input field should be empty, ready for the new filename to be entered. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is taken because the Markor app is not visible on the home screen, and opening the app drawer is the standard way to find and launch apps. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the Markor app is now visible and accessible.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[868,615],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Markor\\' app icon, which is located at approximately [868, 615] in the app drawer. This action is intended to open the Markor application. The Markor app icon is currently visible and ready to be tapped. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Markor app icon at [868, 615] successfully opened the Markor application. The screen changed from the app drawer to the Markor app\\'s main file browser interface. This action completed Subgoal 1 and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s request. The Markor app is now ready for the next step: creating a new note.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[864,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the red \\'+\\' button located at approximately [864, 893] in the bottom right corner of the screen. This action is intended to initiate the creation of a new note or file within the Markor app. The button is currently visible and ready to be tapped. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'+\\' button successfully opened a \\'Name\\' dialog box. This dialog allows for specifying the name, type, and template for a new file or folder. The default name is \\'my_note\\' and the default type is \\'Markdown\\', resulting in a \\'.md\\' extension. This action has brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 2, as the interface for naming the new note is now active.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[396,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the name input field, which currently shows \\'my_note\\'. The tap coordinates are approximately [396, 153], targeting the center of the text \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to focus the text field, allowing for deletion of the current text and input of the new filename. The field is currently displaying \\'my_note\\' and is underlined in red. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the name input field (displaying \\'my_note\\') was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared. This prepares the field for editing, moving closer to completing Subgoal 2. The next action will be to delete the existing text.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the focused name input field. The field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. After this action, the name input field should be empty, ready for the new filename to be entered. Actual Outcome: The action to delete all text in the focused name input field failed. The text \\'my_note\\' is still present in the input field. The field remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the prerequisite step of clearing the existing filename was not achieved.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nCreate a new note in Markor named fair_ant_XOdi.txt with the following text: Actions speak louder than words.. Share the entire content of the note with the phone number +13192815309 via SMS using Simple SMS Messenger\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen ([900, 500]) to the top-middle of the screen ([100, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is taken because the Markor app is not visible on the home screen, and opening the app drawer is the standard way to find and launch apps. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the Markor app is now visible and accessible.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[868,615],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Markor\\' app icon, which is located at approximately [868, 615] in the app drawer. This action is intended to open the Markor application. The Markor app icon is currently visible and ready to be tapped. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Markor app icon at [868, 615] successfully opened the Markor application. The screen changed from the app drawer to the Markor app\\'s main file browser interface. This action completed Subgoal 1 and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s request. The Markor app is now ready for the next step: creating a new note.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[864,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the red \\'+\\' button located at approximately [864, 893] in the bottom right corner of the screen. This action is intended to initiate the creation of a new note or file within the Markor app. The button is currently visible and ready to be tapped. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'+\\' button successfully opened a \\'Name\\' dialog box. This dialog allows for specifying the name, type, and template for a new file or folder. The default name is \\'my_note\\' and the default type is \\'Markdown\\', resulting in a \\'.md\\' extension. This action has brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 2, as the interface for naming the new note is now active.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[396,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the name input field, which currently shows \\'my_note\\'. The tap coordinates are approximately [396, 153], targeting the center of the text \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to focus the text field, allowing for deletion of the current text and input of the new filename. The field is currently displaying \\'my_note\\' and is underlined in red. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the name input field (displaying \\'my_note\\') was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared. This prepares the field for editing, moving closer to completing Subgoal 2. The next action will be to delete the existing text.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the focused name input field. The field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. After this action, the name input field should be empty, ready for the new filename to be entered. Actual Outcome: The action to delete all text in the focused name input field failed. The text \\'my_note\\' is still present in the input field. The field remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the prerequisite step of clearing the existing filename was not achieved.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 5: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Retry deleting the text \\'my_note\\' from the focused name input field using the \\'delete all text\\' action. The field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. After this action, the name input field should ideally be empty, ready for the new filename \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\' to be entered. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Share the entire content of the note with the phone number +13192815309 via SMS using Simple SMS Messenger\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[868,615],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Markor\\' app icon, which is located at approximately [868, 615] in the app drawer. This action is intended to open the Markor application. The Markor app icon is currently visible and ready to be tapped. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Markor app icon at [868, 615] successfully opened the Markor application. The screen changed from the app drawer to the Markor app\\'s main file browser interface. This action completed Subgoal 1 and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s request. The Markor app is now ready for the next step: creating a new note.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[864,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the red \\'+\\' button located at approximately [864, 893] in the bottom right corner of the screen. This action is intended to initiate the creation of a new note or file within the Markor app. The button is currently visible and ready to be tapped. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'+\\' button successfully opened a \\'Name\\' dialog box. This dialog allows for specifying the name, type, and template for a new file or folder. The default name is \\'my_note\\' and the default type is \\'Markdown\\', resulting in a \\'.md\\' extension. This action has brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 2, as the interface for naming the new note is now active.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[396,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the name input field, which currently shows \\'my_note\\'. The tap coordinates are approximately [396, 153], targeting the center of the text \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to focus the text field, allowing for deletion of the current text and input of the new filename. The field is currently displaying \\'my_note\\' and is underlined in red. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the name input field (displaying \\'my_note\\') was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared. This prepares the field for editing, moving closer to completing Subgoal 2. The next action will be to delete the existing text.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the focused name input field. The field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. After this action, the name input field should be empty, ready for the new filename to be entered. Actual Outcome: The action to delete all text in the focused name input field failed. The text \\'my_note\\' is still present in the input field. The field remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the prerequisite step of clearing the existing filename was not achieved.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Retry deleting the text \\'my_note\\' from the focused name input field using the \\'delete all text\\' action. The field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. After this action, the name input field should ideally be empty, ready for the new filename \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\' to be entered. Actual Outcome: The action to delete all text in the focused name input field failed again. The text \\'my_note\\' is still present in the input field. The field remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the prerequisite step of clearing the existing filename was not achieved. The \"delete all text\" action seems to be unreliable in this specific application or context.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 6: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send 7 \\'KEYCODE_DEL\\' (backspace) keyevents to delete the 7 characters of \\'my_note\\' from the focused name input field. The field currently contains \\'my_note\\'. After this action, the name input field should be empty. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[864,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the red \\'+\\' button located at approximately [864, 893] in the bottom right corner of the screen. This action is intended to initiate the creation of a new note or file within the Markor app. The button is currently visible and ready to be tapped. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'+\\' button successfully opened a \\'Name\\' dialog box. This dialog allows for specifying the name, type, and template for a new file or folder. The default name is \\'my_note\\' and the default type is \\'Markdown\\', resulting in a \\'.md\\' extension. This action has brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 2, as the interface for naming the new note is now active.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[396,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the name input field, which currently shows \\'my_note\\'. The tap coordinates are approximately [396, 153], targeting the center of the text \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to focus the text field, allowing for deletion of the current text and input of the new filename. The field is currently displaying \\'my_note\\' and is underlined in red. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the name input field (displaying \\'my_note\\') was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared. This prepares the field for editing, moving closer to completing Subgoal 2. The next action will be to delete the existing text.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the focused name input field. The field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. After this action, the name input field should be empty, ready for the new filename to be entered. Actual Outcome: The action to delete all text in the focused name input field failed. The text \\'my_note\\' is still present in the input field. The field remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the prerequisite step of clearing the existing filename was not achieved.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Retry deleting the text \\'my_note\\' from the focused name input field using the \\'delete all text\\' action. The field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. After this action, the name input field should ideally be empty, ready for the new filename \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\' to be entered. Actual Outcome: The action to delete all text in the focused name input field failed again. The text \\'my_note\\' is still present in the input field. The field remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the prerequisite step of clearing the existing filename was not achieved. The \"delete all text\" action seems to be unreliable in this specific application or context.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send 7 \\'KEYCODE_DEL\\' (backspace) keyevents to delete the 7 characters of \\'my_note\\' from the focused name input field. The field currently contains \\'my_note\\'. After this action, the name input field should be empty. Actual Outcome: The action of sending 7 `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevents failed to delete the text \"my_note\" from the name input field. The text remains in the field. This is the third consecutive failed attempt to clear this text field (previously using \"delete all text\" twice). The agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal. The problem of clearing the text field persists.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Share the entire content of the note with the phone number +13192815309 via SMS using Simple SMS Messenger\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[864,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the red \\'+\\' button located at approximately [864, 893] in the bottom right corner of the screen. This action is intended to initiate the creation of a new note or file within the Markor app. The button is currently visible and ready to be tapped. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'+\\' button successfully opened a \\'Name\\' dialog box. This dialog allows for specifying the name, type, and template for a new file or folder. The default name is \\'my_note\\' and the default type is \\'Markdown\\', resulting in a \\'.md\\' extension. This action has brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 2, as the interface for naming the new note is now active.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[396,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the name input field, which currently shows \\'my_note\\'. The tap coordinates are approximately [396, 153], targeting the center of the text \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to focus the text field, allowing for deletion of the current text and input of the new filename. The field is currently displaying \\'my_note\\' and is underlined in red. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the name input field (displaying \\'my_note\\') was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared. This prepares the field for editing, moving closer to completing Subgoal 2. The next action will be to delete the existing text.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the focused name input field. The field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. After this action, the name input field should be empty, ready for the new filename to be entered. Actual Outcome: The action to delete all text in the focused name input field failed. The text \\'my_note\\' is still present in the input field. The field remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the prerequisite step of clearing the existing filename was not achieved.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Retry deleting the text \\'my_note\\' from the focused name input field using the \\'delete all text\\' action. The field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. After this action, the name input field should ideally be empty, ready for the new filename \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\' to be entered. Actual Outcome: The action to delete all text in the focused name input field failed again. The text \\'my_note\\' is still present in the input field. The field remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the prerequisite step of clearing the existing filename was not achieved. The \"delete all text\" action seems to be unreliable in this specific application or context.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send 7 \\'KEYCODE_DEL\\' (backspace) keyevents to delete the 7 characters of \\'my_note\\' from the focused name input field. The field currently contains \\'my_note\\'. After this action, the name input field should be empty. Actual Outcome: The action of sending 7 `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevents failed to delete the text \"my_note\" from the name input field. The text remains in the field. This is the third consecutive failed attempt to clear this text field (previously using \"delete all text\" twice). The agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal. The problem of clearing the text field persists.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 7: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[375,200],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field, at approximately [375, 200]. This is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted in the next step. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[396,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the name input field, which currently shows \\'my_note\\'. The tap coordinates are approximately [396, 153], targeting the center of the text \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to focus the text field, allowing for deletion of the current text and input of the new filename. The field is currently displaying \\'my_note\\' and is underlined in red. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the name input field (displaying \\'my_note\\') was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared. This prepares the field for editing, moving closer to completing Subgoal 2. The next action will be to delete the existing text.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the focused name input field. The field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. After this action, the name input field should be empty, ready for the new filename to be entered. Actual Outcome: The action to delete all text in the focused name input field failed. The text \\'my_note\\' is still present in the input field. The field remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the prerequisite step of clearing the existing filename was not achieved.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Retry deleting the text \\'my_note\\' from the focused name input field using the \\'delete all text\\' action. The field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. After this action, the name input field should ideally be empty, ready for the new filename \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\' to be entered. Actual Outcome: The action to delete all text in the focused name input field failed again. The text \\'my_note\\' is still present in the input field. The field remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the prerequisite step of clearing the existing filename was not achieved. The \"delete all text\" action seems to be unreliable in this specific application or context.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send 7 \\'KEYCODE_DEL\\' (backspace) keyevents to delete the 7 characters of \\'my_note\\' from the focused name input field. The field currently contains \\'my_note\\'. After this action, the name input field should be empty. Actual Outcome: The action of sending 7 `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevents failed to delete the text \"my_note\" from the name input field. The text remains in the field. This is the third consecutive failed attempt to clear this text field (previously using \"delete all text\" twice). The agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal. The problem of clearing the text field persists.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[375,200],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field, at approximately [375, 200]. This is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted in the next step. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. Actual Outcome: The long press on the text \"my_note\" in the name input field successfully triggered a context menu. The menu shows \"Paste\" and a three-dot icon. The text \"my_note\" is still in the input field and is not visually selected, but the appearance of the context menu is a significant step forward, as it provides options for text manipulation.

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Share the entire content of the note with the phone number +13192815309 via SMS using Simple SMS Messenger\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[396,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the name input field, which currently shows \\'my_note\\'. The tap coordinates are approximately [396, 153], targeting the center of the text \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to focus the text field, allowing for deletion of the current text and input of the new filename. The field is currently displaying \\'my_note\\' and is underlined in red. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the name input field (displaying \\'my_note\\') was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared. This prepares the field for editing, moving closer to completing Subgoal 2. The next action will be to delete the existing text.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the focused name input field. The field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. After this action, the name input field should be empty, ready for the new filename to be entered. Actual Outcome: The action to delete all text in the focused name input field failed. The text \\'my_note\\' is still present in the input field. The field remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the prerequisite step of clearing the existing filename was not achieved.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Retry deleting the text \\'my_note\\' from the focused name input field using the \\'delete all text\\' action. The field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. After this action, the name input field should ideally be empty, ready for the new filename \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\' to be entered. Actual Outcome: The action to delete all text in the focused name input field failed again. The text \\'my_note\\' is still present in the input field. The field remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the prerequisite step of clearing the existing filename was not achieved. The \"delete all text\" action seems to be unreliable in this specific application or context.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send 7 \\'KEYCODE_DEL\\' (backspace) keyevents to delete the 7 characters of \\'my_note\\' from the focused name input field. The field currently contains \\'my_note\\'. After this action, the name input field should be empty. Actual Outcome: The action of sending 7 `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevents failed to delete the text \"my_note\" from the name input field. The text remains in the field. This is the third consecutive failed attempt to clear this text field (previously using \"delete all text\" twice). The agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal. The problem of clearing the text field persists.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[375,200],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field, at approximately [375, 200]. This is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted in the next step. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. Actual Outcome: The long press on the text \"my_note\" in the name input field successfully triggered a context menu. The menu shows \"Paste\" and a three-dot icon. The text \"my_note\" is still in the input field and is not visually selected, but the appearance of the context menu is a significant step forward, as it provides options for text manipulation. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by opening a new path to delete the unwanted text.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 8: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[407,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot icon in the context menu. The context menu currently shows \\'Paste\\' and the three-dot icon, and it appeared after a long press on the filename input field. The tap coordinates are approximately [407, 250], targeting the three-dot icon. This action is expected to open a sub-menu with more text manipulation options, hopefully including \\'Select All\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000.

If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the focused name input field. The field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. After this action, the name input field should be empty, ready for the new filename to be entered. Actual Outcome: The action to delete all text in the focused name input field failed. The text \\'my_note\\' is still present in the input field. The field remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the prerequisite step of clearing the existing filename was not achieved.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Retry deleting the text \\'my_note\\' from the focused name input field using the \\'delete all text\\' action. The field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. After this action, the name input field should ideally be empty, ready for the new filename \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\' to be entered. Actual Outcome: The action to delete all text in the focused name input field failed again. The text \\'my_note\\' is still present in the input field. The field remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the prerequisite step of clearing the existing filename was not achieved. The \"delete all text\" action seems to be unreliable in this specific application or context.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send 7 \\'KEYCODE_DEL\\' (backspace) keyevents to delete the 7 characters of \\'my_note\\' from the focused name input field. The field currently contains \\'my_note\\'. After this action, the name input field should be empty. Actual Outcome: The action of sending 7 `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevents failed to delete the text \"my_note\" from the name input field. The text remains in the field. This is the third consecutive failed attempt to clear this text field (previously using \"delete all text\" twice). The agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal. The problem of clearing the text field persists.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[375,200],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field, at approximately [375, 200]. This is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted in the next step. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. Actual Outcome: The long press on the text \"my_note\" in the name input field successfully triggered a context menu. The menu shows \"Paste\" and a three-dot icon. The text \"my_note\" is still in the input field and is not visually selected, but the appearance of the context menu is a significant step forward, as it provides options for text manipulation. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by opening a new path to delete the unwanted text.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[407,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot icon in the context menu. The context menu currently shows \\'Paste\\' and the three-dot icon, and it appeared after a long press on the filename input field. The tap coordinates are approximately [407, 250], targeting the three-dot icon. This action is expected to open a sub-menu with more text manipulation options, hopefully including \\'Select All\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot icon in the context menu (which appeared after long-pressing \"my_note\") was successful. It opened a new, smaller context menu displaying \"Autofill\" and a back arrow icon. This is not the menu that was expected to contain a \"Select All\" option. The text \"my_note\" remains in the input field. This action changed the state of the context menu system but did not directly advance the deletion of the text. The next logical step is to use the back arrow in the current \"Autofill\" menu to return to a previous state or menu.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Share the entire content of the note with the phone number +13192815309 via SMS using Simple SMS Messenger\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the text \\'my_note\\' from the focused name input field. The field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. After this action, the name input field should be empty, ready for the new filename to be entered. Actual Outcome: The action to delete all text in the focused name input field failed. The text \\'my_note\\' is still present in the input field. The field remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the prerequisite step of clearing the existing filename was not achieved.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Retry deleting the text \\'my_note\\' from the focused name input field using the \\'delete all text\\' action. The field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. After this action, the name input field should ideally be empty, ready for the new filename \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\' to be entered. Actual Outcome: The action to delete all text in the focused name input field failed again. The text \\'my_note\\' is still present in the input field. The field remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the prerequisite step of clearing the existing filename was not achieved. The \"delete all text\" action seems to be unreliable in this specific application or context.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send 7 \\'KEYCODE_DEL\\' (backspace) keyevents to delete the 7 characters of \\'my_note\\' from the focused name input field. The field currently contains \\'my_note\\'. After this action, the name input field should be empty. Actual Outcome: The action of sending 7 `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevents failed to delete the text \"my_note\" from the name input field. The text remains in the field. This is the third consecutive failed attempt to clear this text field (previously using \"delete all text\" twice). The agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal. The problem of clearing the text field persists.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[375,200],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field, at approximately [375, 200]. This is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted in the next step. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. Actual Outcome: The long press on the text \"my_note\" in the name input field successfully triggered a context menu. The menu shows \"Paste\" and a three-dot icon. The text \"my_note\" is still in the input field and is not visually selected, but the appearance of the context menu is a significant step forward, as it provides options for text manipulation. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by opening a new path to delete the unwanted text.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[407,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot icon in the context menu. The context menu currently shows \\'Paste\\' and the three-dot icon, and it appeared after a long press on the filename input field. The tap coordinates are approximately [407, 250], targeting the three-dot icon. This action is expected to open a sub-menu with more text manipulation options, hopefully including \\'Select All\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot icon in the context menu (which appeared after long-pressing \"my_note\") was successful. It opened a new, smaller context menu displaying \"Autofill\" and a back arrow icon. This is not the menu that was expected to contain a \"Select All\" option. The text \"my_note\" remains in the input field. This action changed the state of the context menu system but did not directly advance the deletion of the text.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Retry deleting the text \\'my_note\\' from the focused name input field using the \\'delete all text\\' action. The field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. After this action, the name input field should ideally be empty, ready for the new filename \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\' to be entered. Actual Outcome: The action to delete all text in the focused name input field failed again. The text \\'my_note\\' is still present in the input field. The field remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the prerequisite step of clearing the existing filename was not achieved. The \"delete all text\" action seems to be unreliable in this specific application or context.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send 7 \\'KEYCODE_DEL\\' (backspace) keyevents to delete the 7 characters of \\'my_note\\' from the focused name input field. The field currently contains \\'my_note\\'. After this action, the name input field should be empty. Actual Outcome: The action of sending 7 `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevents failed to delete the text \"my_note\" from the name input field. The text remains in the field. This is the third consecutive failed attempt to clear this text field (previously using \"delete all text\" twice). The agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal. The problem of clearing the text field persists.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[375,200],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field, at approximately [375, 200]. This is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted in the next step. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. Actual Outcome: The long press on the text \"my_note\" in the name input field successfully triggered a context menu. The menu shows \"Paste\" and a three-dot icon. The text \"my_note\" is still in the input field and is not visually selected, but the appearance of the context menu is a significant step forward, as it provides options for text manipulation. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by opening a new path to delete the unwanted text.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[407,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot icon in the context menu. The context menu currently shows \\'Paste\\' and the three-dot icon, and it appeared after a long press on the filename input field. The tap coordinates are approximately [407, 250], targeting the three-dot icon. This action is expected to open a sub-menu with more text manipulation options, hopefully including \\'Select All\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot icon in the context menu (which appeared after long-pressing \"my_note\") was successful. It opened a new, smaller context menu displaying \"Autofill\" and a back arrow icon. This is not the menu that was expected to contain a \"Select All\" option. The text \"my_note\" remains in the input field. This action changed the state of the context menu system but did not directly advance the deletion of the text. The next logical step is to use the back arrow in the current \"Autofill\" menu to return to a previous state or menu.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[407,150],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon within the \\'Autofill\\' context menu. The \\'Autofill\\' menu is currently displayed with \\'Autofill\\' text and a back arrow. This action is expected to close the \\'Autofill\\' menu and return to the previous context menu (which showed \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon) or potentially close the context menu system entirely. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon in the \"Autofill\" context menu was successful. The \"Autofill\" menu closed, and the previous context menu, which displays \"Paste\" and a three-dot icon, reappeared. The text \"my_note\" remains in the input field. This action successfully navigated back in the context menu hierarchy, allowing for alternative text manipulation strategies.

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Share the entire content of the note with the phone number +13192815309 via SMS using Simple SMS Messenger\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Retry deleting the text \\'my_note\\' from the focused name input field using the \\'delete all text\\' action. The field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. After this action, the name input field should ideally be empty, ready for the new filename \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\' to be entered. Actual Outcome: The action to delete all text in the focused name input field failed again. The text \\'my_note\\' is still present in the input field. The field remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the prerequisite step of clearing the existing filename was not achieved. The \"delete all text\" action seems to be unreliable in this specific application or context.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send 7 \\'KEYCODE_DEL\\' (backspace) keyevents to delete the 7 characters of \\'my_note\\' from the focused name input field. The field currently contains \\'my_note\\'. After this action, the name input field should be empty. Actual Outcome: The action of sending 7 `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevents failed to delete the text \"my_note\" from the name input field. The text remains in the field. This is the third consecutive failed attempt to clear this text field (previously using \"delete all text\" twice). The agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal. The problem of clearing the text field persists.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[375,200],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field, at approximately [375, 200]. This is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted in the next step. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. Actual Outcome: The long press on the text \"my_note\" in the name input field successfully triggered a context menu. The menu shows \"Paste\" and a three-dot icon. The text \"my_note\" is still in the input field and is not visually selected, but the appearance of the context menu is a significant step forward, as it provides options for text manipulation. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by opening a new path to delete the unwanted text.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[407,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot icon in the context menu. The context menu currently shows \\'Paste\\' and the three-dot icon, and it appeared after a long press on the filename input field. The tap coordinates are approximately [407, 250], targeting the three-dot icon. This action is expected to open a sub-menu with more text manipulation options, hopefully including \\'Select All\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot icon in the context menu (which appeared after long-pressing \"my_note\") was successful. It opened a new, smaller context menu displaying \"Autofill\" and a back arrow icon. This is not the menu that was expected to contain a \"Select All\" option. The text \"my_note\" remains in the input field. This action changed the state of the context menu system but did not directly advance the deletion of the text. The next logical step is to use the back arrow in the current \"Autofill\" menu to return to a previous state or menu.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[407,150],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon within the \\'Autofill\\' context menu. The \\'Autofill\\' menu is currently displayed with \\'Autofill\\' text and a back arrow. This action is expected to close the \\'Autofill\\' menu and return to the previous context menu (which showed \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon) or potentially close the context menu system entirely. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon in the \"Autofill\" context menu was successful. The \"Autofill\" menu closed, and the previous context menu, which displays \"Paste\" and a three-dot icon, reappeared. The text \"my_note\" remains in the input field. This action successfully navigated back in the context menu hierarchy, allowing for alternative text manipulation strategies. It brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal by restoring a previous state from which other actions can be attempted to clear the text field.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 10: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[362,108],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' label (coordinates [362, 108]) within the new file dialog. The \\'Name\\' label is above the input field containing \\'my_note\\'. Currently, a context menu with \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon is visible over the input field. This tap is intended to dismiss the context menu, which might be interfering with text manipulation. The input field \\'my_note\\' should remain focused. After this action, the context menu is expected to disappear, allowing for a fresh attempt to select or delete the text \\'my_note\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The field currently contains \\'my_note\\'. After this action, the name input field should be empty. Actual Outcome: The action of sending 7 `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevents failed to delete the text \"my_note\" from the name input field. The text remains in the field. This is the third consecutive failed attempt to clear this text field (previously using \"delete all text\" twice). The agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal. The problem of clearing the text field persists.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[375,200],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field, at approximately [375, 200]. This is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted in the next step. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. Actual Outcome: The long press on the text \"my_note\" in the name input field successfully triggered a context menu. The menu shows \"Paste\" and a three-dot icon. The text \"my_note\" is still in the input field and is not visually selected, but the appearance of the context menu is a significant step forward, as it provides options for text manipulation. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by opening a new path to delete the unwanted text.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[407,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot icon in the context menu. The context menu currently shows \\'Paste\\' and the three-dot icon, and it appeared after a long press on the filename input field. The tap coordinates are approximately [407, 250], targeting the three-dot icon. This action is expected to open a sub-menu with more text manipulation options, hopefully including \\'Select All\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot icon in the context menu (which appeared after long-pressing \"my_note\") was successful. It opened a new, smaller context menu displaying \"Autofill\" and a back arrow icon. This is not the menu that was expected to contain a \"Select All\" option. The text \"my_note\" remains in the input field. This action changed the state of the context menu system but did not directly advance the deletion of the text. The next logical step is to use the back arrow in the current \"Autofill\" menu to return to a previous state or menu.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[407,150],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon within the \\'Autofill\\' context menu. The \\'Autofill\\' menu is currently displayed with \\'Autofill\\' text and a back arrow. This action is expected to close the \\'Autofill\\' menu and return to the previous context menu (which showed \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon) or potentially close the context menu system entirely. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon in the \"Autofill\" context menu was successful. The \"Autofill\" menu closed, and the previous context menu, which displays \"Paste\" and a three-dot icon, reappeared. The text \"my_note\" remains in the input field. This action successfully navigated back in the context menu hierarchy, allowing for alternative text manipulation strategies. It brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal by restoring a previous state from which other actions can be attempted to clear the text field.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[362,108],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' label (coordinates [362, 108]) within the new file dialog. The \\'Name\\' label is above the input field containing \\'my_note\\'. Currently, a context menu with \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon is visible over the input field. This tap is intended to dismiss the context menu, which might be interfering with text manipulation. The input field \\'my_note\\' should remain focused. After this action, the context menu is expected to disappear, allowing for a fresh attempt to select or delete the text \\'my_note\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Name\\' label (coordinates [362, 108]) was successful. The context menu (which previously showed \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon) that was overlaying the filename input field has disappeared. The filename input field still contains the text \\'my_note\\' and remains focused. The virtual keyboard is still active. This action successfully cleared the interfering context menu, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing a new attempt to clear the text field.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is the third consecutive failed attempt to clear this text field (previously using \"delete all text\" twice). The agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal. The problem of clearing the text field persists.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[375,200],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field, at approximately [375, 200]. This is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted in the next step. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. Actual Outcome: The long press on the text \"my_note\" in the name input field successfully triggered a context menu. The menu shows \"Paste\" and a three-dot icon. The text \"my_note\" is still in the input field and is not visually selected, but the appearance of the context menu is a significant step forward, as it provides options for text manipulation. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by opening a new path to delete the unwanted text.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[407,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot icon in the context menu. The context menu currently shows \\'Paste\\' and the three-dot icon, and it appeared after a long press on the filename input field. The tap coordinates are approximately [407, 250], targeting the three-dot icon. This action is expected to open a sub-menu with more text manipulation options, hopefully including \\'Select All\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot icon in the context menu (which appeared after long-pressing \"my_note\") was successful. It opened a new, smaller context menu displaying \"Autofill\" and a back arrow icon. This is not the menu that was expected to contain a \"Select All\" option. The text \"my_note\" remains in the input field. This action changed the state of the context menu system but did not directly advance the deletion of the text. The next logical step is to use the back arrow in the current \"Autofill\" menu to return to a previous state or menu.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[407,150],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon within the \\'Autofill\\' context menu. The \\'Autofill\\' menu is currently displayed with \\'Autofill\\' text and a back arrow. This action is expected to close the \\'Autofill\\' menu and return to the previous context menu (which showed \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon) or potentially close the context menu system entirely. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon in the \"Autofill\" context menu was successful. The \"Autofill\" menu closed, and the previous context menu, which displays \"Paste\" and a three-dot icon, reappeared. The text \"my_note\" remains in the input field. This action successfully navigated back in the context menu hierarchy, allowing for alternative text manipulation strategies. It brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal by restoring a previous state from which other actions can be attempted to clear the text field.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[362,108],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' label (coordinates [362, 108]) within the new file dialog. The \\'Name\\' label is above the input field containing \\'my_note\\'. Currently, a context menu with \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon is visible over the input field. This tap is intended to dismiss the context menu, which might be interfering with text manipulation. The input field \\'my_note\\' should remain focused. After this action, the context menu is expected to disappear, allowing for a fresh attempt to select or delete the text \\'my_note\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Name\\' label (coordinates [362, 108]) was successful. The context menu (which previously showed \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon) that was overlaying the filename input field has disappeared. The filename input field still contains the text \\'my_note\\' and remains focused. The virtual keyboard is still active. This action successfully cleared the interfering context menu, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing a new attempt to clear the text field.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 11: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Attempt to delete all text from the focused name input field, which currently contains \\'my_note\\'. The input field has resource-id \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\\'. If successful, the field will be empty, ready for the new filename. If it fails again, an alternative method for text deletion will be required. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[375,200],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field, at approximately [375, 200]. This is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted in the next step. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. Actual Outcome: The long press on the text \"my_note\" in the name input field successfully triggered a context menu. The menu shows \"Paste\" and a three-dot icon. The text \"my_note\" is still in the input field and is not visually selected, but the appearance of the context menu is a significant step forward, as it provides options for text manipulation. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by opening a new path to delete the unwanted text.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[407,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot icon in the context menu. The context menu currently shows \\'Paste\\' and the three-dot icon, and it appeared after a long press on the filename input field. The tap coordinates are approximately [407, 250], targeting the three-dot icon. This action is expected to open a sub-menu with more text manipulation options, hopefully including \\'Select All\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot icon in the context menu (which appeared after long-pressing \"my_note\") was successful. It opened a new, smaller context menu displaying \"Autofill\" and a back arrow icon. This is not the menu that was expected to contain a \"Select All\" option. The text \"my_note\" remains in the input field. This action changed the state of the context menu system but did not directly advance the deletion of the text. The next logical step is to use the back arrow in the current \"Autofill\" menu to return to a previous state or menu.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[407,150],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon within the \\'Autofill\\' context menu. The \\'Autofill\\' menu is currently displayed with \\'Autofill\\' text and a back arrow. This action is expected to close the \\'Autofill\\' menu and return to the previous context menu (which showed \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon) or potentially close the context menu system entirely. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon in the \"Autofill\" context menu was successful. The \"Autofill\" menu closed, and the previous context menu, which displays \"Paste\" and a three-dot icon, reappeared. The text \"my_note\" remains in the input field. This action successfully navigated back in the context menu hierarchy, allowing for alternative text manipulation strategies. It brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal by restoring a previous state from which other actions can be attempted to clear the text field.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[362,108],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' label (coordinates [362, 108]) within the new file dialog. The \\'Name\\' label is above the input field containing \\'my_note\\'. Currently, a context menu with \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon is visible over the input field. This tap is intended to dismiss the context menu, which might be interfering with text manipulation. The input field \\'my_note\\' should remain focused. After this action, the context menu is expected to disappear, allowing for a fresh attempt to select or delete the text \\'my_note\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Name\\' label (coordinates [362, 108]) was successful. The context menu (which previously showed \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon) that was overlaying the filename input field has disappeared. The filename input field still contains the text \\'my_note\\' and remains focused. The virtual keyboard is still active. This action successfully cleared the interfering context menu, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing a new attempt to clear the text field.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Attempt to delete all text from the focused name input field, which currently contains \\'my_note\\'. The input field has resource-id \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\\'. If successful, the field will be empty, ready for the new filename. If it fails again, an alternative method for text deletion will be required. Actual Outcome: The action \"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\" (Step 11) failed. The text \"my_note\" was not deleted from the name input field (resource-id=\"net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\"). The input field still contains \"my_note\" and remains focused. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The problem of clearing the text field persists, and alternative methods for text selection and deletion must be pursued as outlined in the plan.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Share the entire content of the note with the phone number +13192815309 via SMS using Simple SMS Messenger\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[375,200],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field, at approximately [375, 200]. This is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted in the next step. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. Actual Outcome: The long press on the text \"my_note\" in the name input field successfully triggered a context menu. The menu shows \"Paste\" and a three-dot icon. The text \"my_note\" is still in the input field and is not visually selected, but the appearance of the context menu is a significant step forward, as it provides options for text manipulation. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by opening a new path to delete the unwanted text.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[407,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot icon in the context menu. The context menu currently shows \\'Paste\\' and the three-dot icon, and it appeared after a long press on the filename input field. The tap coordinates are approximately [407, 250], targeting the three-dot icon. This action is expected to open a sub-menu with more text manipulation options, hopefully including \\'Select All\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot icon in the context menu (which appeared after long-pressing \"my_note\") was successful. It opened a new, smaller context menu displaying \"Autofill\" and a back arrow icon. This is not the menu that was expected to contain a \"Select All\" option. The text \"my_note\" remains in the input field. This action changed the state of the context menu system but did not directly advance the deletion of the text. The next logical step is to use the back arrow in the current \"Autofill\" menu to return to a previous state or menu.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[407,150],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon within the \\'Autofill\\' context menu. The \\'Autofill\\' menu is currently displayed with \\'Autofill\\' text and a back arrow. This action is expected to close the \\'Autofill\\' menu and return to the previous context menu (which showed \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon) or potentially close the context menu system entirely. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon in the \"Autofill\" context menu was successful. The \"Autofill\" menu closed, and the previous context menu, which displays \"Paste\" and a three-dot icon, reappeared. The text \"my_note\" remains in the input field. This action successfully navigated back in the context menu hierarchy, allowing for alternative text manipulation strategies. It brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal by restoring a previous state from which other actions can be attempted to clear the text field.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[362,108],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' label (coordinates [362, 108]) within the new file dialog. The \\'Name\\' label is above the input field containing \\'my_note\\'. Currently, a context menu with \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon is visible over the input field. This tap is intended to dismiss the context menu, which might be interfering with text manipulation. The input field \\'my_note\\' should remain focused. After this action, the context menu is expected to disappear, allowing for a fresh attempt to select or delete the text \\'my_note\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Name\\' label (coordinates [362, 108]) was successful. The context menu (which previously showed \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon) that was overlaying the filename input field has disappeared. The filename input field still contains the text \\'my_note\\' and remains focused. The virtual keyboard is still active. This action successfully cleared the interfering context menu, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing a new attempt to clear the text field.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Attempt to delete all text from the focused name input field, which currently contains \\'my_note\\'. The input field has resource-id \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\\'. If successful, the field will be empty, ready for the new filename. If it fails again, an alternative method for text deletion will be required. Actual Outcome: The action \"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\" (Step 11) failed. The text \"my_note\" was not deleted from the name input field (resource-id=\"net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\"). The input field still contains \"my_note\" and remains focused. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The problem of clearing the text field persists, and alternative methods for text selection and deletion must be pursued as outlined in the plan.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 12: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Double tap on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. This is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action will be executed twice in quick succession to simulate a double tap. The first tap is described here. The second tap will be identical and will be the next action if this one doesn\\'t trigger the desired outcome immediately (which is unlikely for a single tap of a double-tap sequence). The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[407,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot icon in the context menu. The context menu currently shows \\'Paste\\' and the three-dot icon, and it appeared after a long press on the filename input field. The tap coordinates are approximately [407, 250], targeting the three-dot icon. This action is expected to open a sub-menu with more text manipulation options, hopefully including \\'Select All\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot icon in the context menu (which appeared after long-pressing \"my_note\") was successful. It opened a new, smaller context menu displaying \"Autofill\" and a back arrow icon. This is not the menu that was expected to contain a \"Select All\" option. The text \"my_note\" remains in the input field. This action changed the state of the context menu system but did not directly advance the deletion of the text. The next logical step is to use the back arrow in the current \"Autofill\" menu to return to a previous state or menu.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[407,150],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon within the \\'Autofill\\' context menu. The \\'Autofill\\' menu is currently displayed with \\'Autofill\\' text and a back arrow. This action is expected to close the \\'Autofill\\' menu and return to the previous context menu (which showed \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon) or potentially close the context menu system entirely. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon in the \"Autofill\" context menu was successful. The \"Autofill\" menu closed, and the previous context menu, which displays \"Paste\" and a three-dot icon, reappeared. The text \"my_note\" remains in the input field. This action successfully navigated back in the context menu hierarchy, allowing for alternative text manipulation strategies. It brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal by restoring a previous state from which other actions can be attempted to clear the text field.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[362,108],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' label (coordinates [362, 108]) within the new file dialog. The \\'Name\\' label is above the input field containing \\'my_note\\'. Currently, a context menu with \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon is visible over the input field. This tap is intended to dismiss the context menu, which might be interfering with text manipulation. The input field \\'my_note\\' should remain focused. After this action, the context menu is expected to disappear, allowing for a fresh attempt to select or delete the text \\'my_note\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Name\\' label (coordinates [362, 108]) was successful. The context menu (which previously showed \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon) that was overlaying the filename input field has disappeared. The filename input field still contains the text \\'my_note\\' and remains focused. The virtual keyboard is still active. This action successfully cleared the interfering context menu, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing a new attempt to clear the text field.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Attempt to delete all text from the focused name input field, which currently contains \\'my_note\\'. The input field has resource-id \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\\'. If successful, the field will be empty, ready for the new filename. If it fails again, an alternative method for text deletion will be required. Actual Outcome: The action \"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\" (Step 11) failed. The text \"my_note\" was not deleted from the name input field (resource-id=\"net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\"). The input field still contains \"my_note\" and remains focused. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The problem of clearing the text field persists, and alternative methods for text selection and deletion must be pursued as outlined in the plan.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Double tap on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. This is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action will be executed twice in quick succession to simulate a double tap. The first tap is described here. The second tap will be identical and will be the next action if this one doesn\\'t trigger the desired outcome immediately (which is unlikely for a single tap of a double-tap sequence). Actual Outcome: The action was a tap on the text \"my_note\" at [378, 172], intended as the first part of a double-tap. The screen did not change, which is consistent with the first tap of a double-tap sequence. The text \"my_note\" is still in the input field and focused. This action, by itself, did not bring the agent closer to completion, but it is a necessary precursor to the second tap which might achieve text selection.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nCreate a new note in Markor named fair_ant_XOdi.txt with the following text: Actions speak louder than words.. Share the entire content of the note with the phone number +13192815309 via SMS using Simple SMS Messenger\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[407,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot icon in the context menu. The context menu currently shows \\'Paste\\' and the three-dot icon, and it appeared after a long press on the filename input field. The tap coordinates are approximately [407, 250], targeting the three-dot icon. This action is expected to open a sub-menu with more text manipulation options, hopefully including \\'Select All\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot icon in the context menu (which appeared after long-pressing \"my_note\") was successful. It opened a new, smaller context menu displaying \"Autofill\" and a back arrow icon. This is not the menu that was expected to contain a \"Select All\" option. The text \"my_note\" remains in the input field. This action changed the state of the context menu system but did not directly advance the deletion of the text. The next logical step is to use the back arrow in the current \"Autofill\" menu to return to a previous state or menu.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[407,150],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon within the \\'Autofill\\' context menu. The \\'Autofill\\' menu is currently displayed with \\'Autofill\\' text and a back arrow. This action is expected to close the \\'Autofill\\' menu and return to the previous context menu (which showed \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon) or potentially close the context menu system entirely. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon in the \"Autofill\" context menu was successful. The \"Autofill\" menu closed, and the previous context menu, which displays \"Paste\" and a three-dot icon, reappeared. The text \"my_note\" remains in the input field. This action successfully navigated back in the context menu hierarchy, allowing for alternative text manipulation strategies. It brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal by restoring a previous state from which other actions can be attempted to clear the text field.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[362,108],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' label (coordinates [362, 108]) within the new file dialog. The \\'Name\\' label is above the input field containing \\'my_note\\'. Currently, a context menu with \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon is visible over the input field. This tap is intended to dismiss the context menu, which might be interfering with text manipulation. The input field \\'my_note\\' should remain focused. After this action, the context menu is expected to disappear, allowing for a fresh attempt to select or delete the text \\'my_note\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Name\\' label (coordinates [362, 108]) was successful. The context menu (which previously showed \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon) that was overlaying the filename input field has disappeared. The filename input field still contains the text \\'my_note\\' and remains focused. The virtual keyboard is still active. This action successfully cleared the interfering context menu, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing a new attempt to clear the text field.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Attempt to delete all text from the focused name input field, which currently contains \\'my_note\\'. The input field has resource-id \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\\'. If successful, the field will be empty, ready for the new filename. If it fails again, an alternative method for text deletion will be required. Actual Outcome: The action \"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\" (Step 11) failed. The text \"my_note\" was not deleted from the name input field (resource-id=\"net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\"). The input field still contains \"my_note\" and remains focused. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The problem of clearing the text field persists, and alternative methods for text selection and deletion must be pursued as outlined in the plan.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Double tap on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. This is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action will be executed twice in quick succession to simulate a double tap. The first tap is described here. The second tap will be identical and will be the next action if this one doesn\\'t trigger the desired outcome immediately (which is unlikely for a single tap of a double-tap sequence). Actual Outcome: The action was a tap on the text \"my_note\" at [378, 172], intended as the first part of a double-tap. The screen did not change, which is consistent with the first tap of a double-tap sequence. The text \"my_note\" is still in the input field and focused. This action, by itself, did not bring the agent closer to completion, but it is a necessary precursor to the second tap which might achieve text selection.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 13: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the second tap of a double-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. If successful, the text \\'my_note\\' will become highlighted or a context menu with options like \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Select All\\' will appear. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[407,150],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon within the \\'Autofill\\' context menu. The \\'Autofill\\' menu is currently displayed with \\'Autofill\\' text and a back arrow. This action is expected to close the \\'Autofill\\' menu and return to the previous context menu (which showed \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon) or potentially close the context menu system entirely. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon in the \"Autofill\" context menu was successful. The \"Autofill\" menu closed, and the previous context menu, which displays \"Paste\" and a three-dot icon, reappeared. The text \"my_note\" remains in the input field. This action successfully navigated back in the context menu hierarchy, allowing for alternative text manipulation strategies. It brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal by restoring a previous state from which other actions can be attempted to clear the text field.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[362,108],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' label (coordinates [362, 108]) within the new file dialog. The \\'Name\\' label is above the input field containing \\'my_note\\'. Currently, a context menu with \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon is visible over the input field. This tap is intended to dismiss the context menu, which might be interfering with text manipulation. The input field \\'my_note\\' should remain focused. After this action, the context menu is expected to disappear, allowing for a fresh attempt to select or delete the text \\'my_note\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Name\\' label (coordinates [362, 108]) was successful. The context menu (which previously showed \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon) that was overlaying the filename input field has disappeared. The filename input field still contains the text \\'my_note\\' and remains focused. The virtual keyboard is still active. This action successfully cleared the interfering context menu, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing a new attempt to clear the text field.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Attempt to delete all text from the focused name input field, which currently contains \\'my_note\\'. The input field has resource-id \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\\'. If successful, the field will be empty, ready for the new filename. If it fails again, an alternative method for text deletion will be required. Actual Outcome: The action \"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\" (Step 11) failed. The text \"my_note\" was not deleted from the name input field (resource-id=\"net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\"). The input field still contains \"my_note\" and remains focused. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The problem of clearing the text field persists, and alternative methods for text selection and deletion must be pursued as outlined in the plan.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Double tap on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. This is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action will be executed twice in quick succession to simulate a double tap. The first tap is described here. The second tap will be identical and will be the next action if this one doesn\\'t trigger the desired outcome immediately (which is unlikely for a single tap of a double-tap sequence). Actual Outcome: The action was a tap on the text \"my_note\" at [378, 172], intended as the first part of a double-tap. The screen did not change, which is consistent with the first tap of a double-tap sequence. The text \"my_note\" is still in the input field and focused. This action, by itself, did not bring the agent closer to completion, but it is a necessary precursor to the second tap which might achieve text selection.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the second tap of a double-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. If successful, the text \\'my_note\\' will become highlighted or a context menu with options like \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Select All\\' will appear. Actual Outcome: The action was the second tap of a double-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' at [378, 172]. This action did not select the text \\'my_note\\' nor did it cause any context menu to appear. The text \\'my_note\\' is still present in the input field and the field remains focused. The virtual keyboard is still active. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the text was not selected for deletion.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing.

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Share the entire content of the note with the phone number +13192815309 via SMS using Simple SMS Messenger\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[407,150],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon within the \\'Autofill\\' context menu. The \\'Autofill\\' menu is currently displayed with \\'Autofill\\' text and a back arrow. This action is expected to close the \\'Autofill\\' menu and return to the previous context menu (which showed \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon) or potentially close the context menu system entirely. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon in the \"Autofill\" context menu was successful. The \"Autofill\" menu closed, and the previous context menu, which displays \"Paste\" and a three-dot icon, reappeared. The text \"my_note\" remains in the input field. This action successfully navigated back in the context menu hierarchy, allowing for alternative text manipulation strategies. It brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal by restoring a previous state from which other actions can be attempted to clear the text field.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[362,108],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' label (coordinates [362, 108]) within the new file dialog. The \\'Name\\' label is above the input field containing \\'my_note\\'. Currently, a context menu with \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon is visible over the input field. This tap is intended to dismiss the context menu, which might be interfering with text manipulation. The input field \\'my_note\\' should remain focused. After this action, the context menu is expected to disappear, allowing for a fresh attempt to select or delete the text \\'my_note\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Name\\' label (coordinates [362, 108]) was successful. The context menu (which previously showed \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon) that was overlaying the filename input field has disappeared. The filename input field still contains the text \\'my_note\\' and remains focused. The virtual keyboard is still active. This action successfully cleared the interfering context menu, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing a new attempt to clear the text field.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Attempt to delete all text from the focused name input field, which currently contains \\'my_note\\'. The input field has resource-id \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\\'. If successful, the field will be empty, ready for the new filename. If it fails again, an alternative method for text deletion will be required. Actual Outcome: The action \"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\" (Step 11) failed. The text \"my_note\" was not deleted from the name input field (resource-id=\"net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\"). The input field still contains \"my_note\" and remains focused. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The problem of clearing the text field persists, and alternative methods for text selection and deletion must be pursued as outlined in the plan.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Double tap on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. This is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action will be executed twice in quick succession to simulate a double tap. The first tap is described here. The second tap will be identical and will be the next action if this one doesn\\'t trigger the desired outcome immediately (which is unlikely for a single tap of a double-tap sequence). Actual Outcome: The action was a tap on the text \"my_note\" at [378, 172], intended as the first part of a double-tap. The screen did not change, which is consistent with the first tap of a double-tap sequence. The text \"my_note\" is still in the input field and focused. This action, by itself, did not bring the agent closer to completion, but it is a necessary precursor to the second tap which might achieve text selection.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the second tap of a double-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. If successful, the text \\'my_note\\' will become highlighted or a context menu with options like \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Select All\\' will appear. Actual Outcome: The action was the second tap of a double-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' at [378, 172]. This action did not select the text \\'my_note\\' nor did it cause any context menu to appear. The text \\'my_note\\' is still present in the input field and the field remains focused. The virtual keyboard is still active. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the text was not selected for deletion.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 14: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the first tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172].

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[362,108],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' label (coordinates [362, 108]) within the new file dialog. The \\'Name\\' label is above the input field containing \\'my_note\\'. Currently, a context menu with \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon is visible over the input field. This tap is intended to dismiss the context menu, which might be interfering with text manipulation. The input field \\'my_note\\' should remain focused. After this action, the context menu is expected to disappear, allowing for a fresh attempt to select or delete the text \\'my_note\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Name\\' label (coordinates [362, 108]) was successful. The context menu (which previously showed \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon) that was overlaying the filename input field has disappeared. The filename input field still contains the text \\'my_note\\' and remains focused. The virtual keyboard is still active. This action successfully cleared the interfering context menu, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing a new attempt to clear the text field.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Attempt to delete all text from the focused name input field, which currently contains \\'my_note\\'. The input field has resource-id \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\\'. If successful, the field will be empty, ready for the new filename. If it fails again, an alternative method for text deletion will be required. Actual Outcome: The action \"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\" (Step 11) failed. The text \"my_note\" was not deleted from the name input field (resource-id=\"net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\"). The input field still contains \"my_note\" and remains focused. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The problem of clearing the text field persists, and alternative methods for text selection and deletion must be pursued as outlined in the plan.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Double tap on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. This is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action will be executed twice in quick succession to simulate a double tap. The first tap is described here. The second tap will be identical and will be the next action if this one doesn\\'t trigger the desired outcome immediately (which is unlikely for a single tap of a double-tap sequence). Actual Outcome: The action was a tap on the text \"my_note\" at [378, 172], intended as the first part of a double-tap. The screen did not change, which is consistent with the first tap of a double-tap sequence. The text \"my_note\" is still in the input field and focused. This action, by itself, did not bring the agent closer to completion, but it is a necessary precursor to the second tap which might achieve text selection.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the second tap of a double-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. If successful, the text \\'my_note\\' will become highlighted or a context menu with options like \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Select All\\' will appear. Actual Outcome: The action was the second tap of a double-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' at [378, 172]. This action did not select the text \\'my_note\\' nor did it cause any context menu to appear. The text \\'my_note\\' is still present in the input field and the field remains focused. The virtual keyboard is still active. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the text was not selected for deletion.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the first tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. This single tap is not expected to select the text on its own but is the first step in a triple-tap. Actual Outcome: The action was the first tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' at [378, 172]. No visual change occurred on the screen, which is consistent with the first tap of a multi-tap gesture. The text \\'my_note\\' is still in the input field, and the field remains focused. The virtual keyboard is still active.

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Share the entire content of the note with the phone number +13192815309 via SMS using Simple SMS Messenger\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[362,108],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' label (coordinates [362, 108]) within the new file dialog. The \\'Name\\' label is above the input field containing \\'my_note\\'. Currently, a context menu with \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon is visible over the input field. This tap is intended to dismiss the context menu, which might be interfering with text manipulation. The input field \\'my_note\\' should remain focused. After this action, the context menu is expected to disappear, allowing for a fresh attempt to select or delete the text \\'my_note\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Name\\' label (coordinates [362, 108]) was successful. The context menu (which previously showed \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon) that was overlaying the filename input field has disappeared. The filename input field still contains the text \\'my_note\\' and remains focused. The virtual keyboard is still active. This action successfully cleared the interfering context menu, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing a new attempt to clear the text field.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Attempt to delete all text from the focused name input field, which currently contains \\'my_note\\'. The input field has resource-id \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\\'. If successful, the field will be empty, ready for the new filename. If it fails again, an alternative method for text deletion will be required. Actual Outcome: The action \"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\" (Step 11) failed. The text \"my_note\" was not deleted from the name input field (resource-id=\"net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\"). The input field still contains \"my_note\" and remains focused. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The problem of clearing the text field persists, and alternative methods for text selection and deletion must be pursued as outlined in the plan.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Double tap on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. This is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action will be executed twice in quick succession to simulate a double tap. The first tap is described here. The second tap will be identical and will be the next action if this one doesn\\'t trigger the desired outcome immediately (which is unlikely for a single tap of a double-tap sequence). Actual Outcome: The action was a tap on the text \"my_note\" at [378, 172], intended as the first part of a double-tap. The screen did not change, which is consistent with the first tap of a double-tap sequence. The text \"my_note\" is still in the input field and focused. This action, by itself, did not bring the agent closer to completion, but it is a necessary precursor to the second tap which might achieve text selection.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the second tap of a double-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. If successful, the text \\'my_note\\' will become highlighted or a context menu with options like \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Select All\\' will appear. Actual Outcome: The action was the second tap of a double-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' at [378, 172]. This action did not select the text \\'my_note\\' nor did it cause any context menu to appear. The text \\'my_note\\' is still present in the input field and the field remains focused. The virtual keyboard is still active. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the text was not selected for deletion.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the first tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. This single tap is not expected to select the text on its own but is the first step in a triple-tap. Actual Outcome: The action was the first tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' at [378, 172]. No visual change occurred on the screen, which is consistent with the first tap of a multi-tap gesture. The text \\'my_note\\' is still in the input field, and the field remains focused. The virtual keyboard is still active. This action, by itself, did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, but it is a necessary step in the planned triple-tap sequence to select the text.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 15: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the second tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is part of an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. This single tap is not expected to select the text on its own but is the second step in a triple-tap.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Attempt to delete all text from the focused name input field, which currently contains \\'my_note\\'. The input field has resource-id \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\\'. If successful, the field will be empty, ready for the new filename. If it fails again, an alternative method for text deletion will be required. Actual Outcome: The action \"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\" (Step 11) failed. The text \"my_note\" was not deleted from the name input field (resource-id=\"net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\"). The input field still contains \"my_note\" and remains focused. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The problem of clearing the text field persists, and alternative methods for text selection and deletion must be pursued as outlined in the plan.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Double tap on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. This is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action will be executed twice in quick succession to simulate a double tap. The first tap is described here. The second tap will be identical and will be the next action if this one doesn\\'t trigger the desired outcome immediately (which is unlikely for a single tap of a double-tap sequence). Actual Outcome: The action was a tap on the text \"my_note\" at [378, 172], intended as the first part of a double-tap. The screen did not change, which is consistent with the first tap of a double-tap sequence. The text \"my_note\" is still in the input field and focused. This action, by itself, did not bring the agent closer to completion, but it is a necessary precursor to the second tap which might achieve text selection.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the second tap of a double-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. If successful, the text \\'my_note\\' will become highlighted or a context menu with options like \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Select All\\' will appear. Actual Outcome: The action was the second tap of a double-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' at [378, 172]. This action did not select the text \\'my_note\\' nor did it cause any context menu to appear. The text \\'my_note\\' is still present in the input field and the field remains focused. The virtual keyboard is still active. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the text was not selected for deletion.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the first tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. This single tap is not expected to select the text on its own but is the first step in a triple-tap. Actual Outcome: The action was the first tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' at [378, 172]. No visual change occurred on the screen, which is consistent with the first tap of a multi-tap gesture. The text \\'my_note\\' is still in the input field, and the field remains focused. The virtual keyboard is still active. This action, by itself, did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, but it is a necessary step in the planned triple-tap sequence to select the text.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the second tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is part of an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. This single tap is not expected to select the text on its own but is the second step in a triple-tap. Actual Outcome: The action was the second tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' at coordinates [378, 172]. There was no visual change on the screen as a result of this action. The text \\'my_note\\' remains in the input field, and the field is still focused. The virtual keyboard is also still visible. This action did not, by itself, achieve the goal of selecting the text for deletion, but it was a planned intermediate step in the triple-tap gesture.

Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nCreate a new note in Markor named fair_ant_XOdi.txt with the following text: Actions speak louder than words.. Share the entire content of the note with the phone number +13192815309 via SMS using Simple SMS Messenger\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Attempt to delete all text from the focused name input field, which currently contains \\'my_note\\'. The input field has resource-id \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\\'. If successful, the field will be empty, ready for the new filename. If it fails again, an alternative method for text deletion will be required. Actual Outcome: The action \"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\" (Step 11) failed. The text \"my_note\" was not deleted from the name input field (resource-id=\"net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\"). The input field still contains \"my_note\" and remains focused. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The problem of clearing the text field persists, and alternative methods for text selection and deletion must be pursued as outlined in the plan.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Double tap on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. This is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action will be executed twice in quick succession to simulate a double tap. The first tap is described here. The second tap will be identical and will be the next action if this one doesn\\'t trigger the desired outcome immediately (which is unlikely for a single tap of a double-tap sequence). Actual Outcome: The action was a tap on the text \"my_note\" at [378, 172], intended as the first part of a double-tap. The screen did not change, which is consistent with the first tap of a double-tap sequence. The text \"my_note\" is still in the input field and focused. This action, by itself, did not bring the agent closer to completion, but it is a necessary precursor to the second tap which might achieve text selection.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the second tap of a double-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. If successful, the text \\'my_note\\' will become highlighted or a context menu with options like \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Select All\\' will appear. Actual Outcome: The action was the second tap of a double-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' at [378, 172]. This action did not select the text \\'my_note\\' nor did it cause any context menu to appear. The text \\'my_note\\' is still present in the input field and the field remains focused. The virtual keyboard is still active. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the text was not selected for deletion.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the first tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. This single tap is not expected to select the text on its own but is the first step in a triple-tap. Actual Outcome: The action was the first tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' at [378, 172]. No visual change occurred on the screen, which is consistent with the first tap of a multi-tap gesture. The text \\'my_note\\' is still in the input field, and the field remains focused. The virtual keyboard is still active. This action, by itself, did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, but it is a necessary step in the planned triple-tap sequence to select the text.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the second tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is part of an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. This single tap is not expected to select the text on its own but is the second step in a triple-tap. Actual Outcome: The action was the second tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' at coordinates [378, 172]. There was no visual change on the screen as a result of this action. The text \\'my_note\\' remains in the input field, and the field is still focused. The virtual keyboard is also still visible. This action did not, by itself, achieve the goal of selecting the text for deletion, but it was a planned intermediate step in the triple-tap gesture. The overall goal of clearing the text field has not yet been achieved.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 16: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the third tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. If successful, the text \\'my_note\\' will become highlighted or a context menu with options like \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Select All\\' will appear.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Double tap on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. This is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action will be executed twice in quick succession to simulate a double tap. The first tap is described here. The second tap will be identical and will be the next action if this one doesn\\'t trigger the desired outcome immediately (which is unlikely for a single tap of a double-tap sequence). Actual Outcome: The action was a tap on the text \"my_note\" at [378, 172], intended as the first part of a double-tap. The screen did not change, which is consistent with the first tap of a double-tap sequence. The text \"my_note\" is still in the input field and focused. This action, by itself, did not bring the agent closer to completion, but it is a necessary precursor to the second tap which might achieve text selection.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the second tap of a double-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. If successful, the text \\'my_note\\' will become highlighted or a context menu with options like \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Select All\\' will appear. Actual Outcome: The action was the second tap of a double-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' at [378, 172]. This action did not select the text \\'my_note\\' nor did it cause any context menu to appear. The text \\'my_note\\' is still present in the input field and the field remains focused. The virtual keyboard is still active. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the text was not selected for deletion.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the first tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. This single tap is not expected to select the text on its own but is the first step in a triple-tap. Actual Outcome: The action was the first tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' at [378, 172]. No visual change occurred on the screen, which is consistent with the first tap of a multi-tap gesture. The text \\'my_note\\' is still in the input field, and the field remains focused. The virtual keyboard is still active. This action, by itself, did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, but it is a necessary step in the planned triple-tap sequence to select the text.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the second tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is part of an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. This single tap is not expected to select the text on its own but is the second step in a triple-tap. Actual Outcome: The action was the second tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' at coordinates [378, 172]. There was no visual change on the screen as a result of this action. The text \\'my_note\\' remains in the input field, and the field is still focused. The virtual keyboard is also still visible. This action did not, by itself, achieve the goal of selecting the text for deletion, but it was a planned intermediate step in the triple-tap gesture. The overall goal of clearing the text field has not yet been achieved.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the third tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. If successful, the text \\'my_note\\' will become highlighted or a context menu with options like \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Select All\\' will appear. Actual Outcome: The action was the third tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' at coordinates [378, 172]. This action failed to select the text \\'my_note\\'. No visual change occurred on the screen. The text \\'my_note\\' remains in the input field, the field is still focused, and the virtual keyboard is visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note, as the existing text could not be selected for deletion.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Share the entire content of the note with the phone number +13192815309 via SMS using Simple SMS Messenger\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Double tap on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. This is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action will be executed twice in quick succession to simulate a double tap. The first tap is described here. The second tap will be identical and will be the next action if this one doesn\\'t trigger the desired outcome immediately (which is unlikely for a single tap of a double-tap sequence). Actual Outcome: The action was a tap on the text \"my_note\" at [378, 172], intended as the first part of a double-tap. The screen did not change, which is consistent with the first tap of a double-tap sequence. The text \"my_note\" is still in the input field and focused. This action, by itself, did not bring the agent closer to completion, but it is a necessary precursor to the second tap which might achieve text selection.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the second tap of a double-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. If successful, the text \\'my_note\\' will become highlighted or a context menu with options like \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Select All\\' will appear. Actual Outcome: The action was the second tap of a double-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' at [378, 172]. This action did not select the text \\'my_note\\' nor did it cause any context menu to appear. The text \\'my_note\\' is still present in the input field and the field remains focused. The virtual keyboard is still active. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the text was not selected for deletion.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the first tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. This single tap is not expected to select the text on its own but is the first step in a triple-tap. Actual Outcome: The action was the first tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' at [378, 172]. No visual change occurred on the screen, which is consistent with the first tap of a multi-tap gesture. The text \\'my_note\\' is still in the input field, and the field remains focused. The virtual keyboard is still active. This action, by itself, did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, but it is a necessary step in the planned triple-tap sequence to select the text.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the second tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is part of an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. This single tap is not expected to select the text on its own but is the second step in a triple-tap. Actual Outcome: The action was the second tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' at coordinates [378, 172]. There was no visual change on the screen as a result of this action. The text \\'my_note\\' remains in the input field, and the field is still focused. The virtual keyboard is also still visible. This action did not, by itself, achieve the goal of selecting the text for deletion, but it was a planned intermediate step in the triple-tap gesture. The overall goal of clearing the text field has not yet been achieved.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the third tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. If successful, the text \\'my_note\\' will become highlighted or a context menu with options like \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Select All\\' will appear. Actual Outcome: The action was the third tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' at coordinates [378, 172]. This action failed to select the text \\'my_note\\'. No visual change occurred on the screen. The text \\'my_note\\' remains in the input field, the field is still focused, and the virtual keyboard is visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note, as the existing text could not be selected for deletion.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 17: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field.

The field has resource-id \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\\' and is confirmed to be focused with text \\'my_note\\'. If successful, the \\'my_note\\' text will be cleared from the input field, leaving it empty and ready for the new filename.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. If successful, the text \\'my_note\\' will become highlighted or a context menu with options like \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Select All\\' will appear. Actual Outcome: The action was the second tap of a double-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' at [378, 172]. This action did not select the text \\'my_note\\' nor did it cause any context menu to appear. The text \\'my_note\\' is still present in the input field and the field remains focused. The virtual keyboard is still active. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the text was not selected for deletion.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the first tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. This single tap is not expected to select the text on its own but is the first step in a triple-tap. Actual Outcome: The action was the first tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' at [378, 172]. No visual change occurred on the screen, which is consistent with the first tap of a multi-tap gesture. The text \\'my_note\\' is still in the input field, and the field remains focused. The virtual keyboard is still active. This action, by itself, did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, but it is a necessary step in the planned triple-tap sequence to select the text.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the second tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is part of an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. This single tap is not expected to select the text on its own but is the second step in a triple-tap. Actual Outcome: The action was the second tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' at coordinates [378, 172]. There was no visual change on the screen as a result of this action. The text \\'my_note\\' remains in the input field, and the field is still focused. The virtual keyboard is also still visible. This action did not, by itself, achieve the goal of selecting the text for deletion, but it was a planned intermediate step in the triple-tap gesture. The overall goal of clearing the text field has not yet been achieved.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the third tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. If successful, the text \\'my_note\\' will become highlighted or a context menu with options like \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Select All\\' will appear. Actual Outcome: The action was the third tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' at coordinates [378, 172]. This action failed to select the text \\'my_note\\'. No visual change occurred on the screen. The text \\'my_note\\' remains in the input field, the field is still focused, and the virtual keyboard is visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note, as the existing text could not be selected for deletion.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Attempt to delete all text from the focused \\'Name\\' input field, which currently contains \\'my_note\\'. The field has resource-id \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\\' and is confirmed to be focused with text \\'my_note\\'. If successful, the \\'my_note\\' text will be cleared from the input field, leaving it empty and ready for the new filename. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' failed. The text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\\') was not deleted. The input field remains focused with the text \\'my_note\\', and the virtual keyboard is still visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Share the entire content of the note with the phone number +13192815309 via SMS using Simple SMS Messenger\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the second tap of a double-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. If successful, the text \\'my_note\\' will become highlighted or a context menu with options like \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Select All\\' will appear. Actual Outcome: The action was the second tap of a double-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' at [378, 172]. This action did not select the text \\'my_note\\' nor did it cause any context menu to appear. The text \\'my_note\\' is still present in the input field and the field remains focused. The virtual keyboard is still active. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the text was not selected for deletion.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the first tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. This single tap is not expected to select the text on its own but is the first step in a triple-tap. Actual Outcome: The action was the first tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' at [378, 172]. No visual change occurred on the screen, which is consistent with the first tap of a multi-tap gesture. The text \\'my_note\\' is still in the input field, and the field remains focused. The virtual keyboard is still active. This action, by itself, did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, but it is a necessary step in the planned triple-tap sequence to select the text.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the second tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is part of an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. This single tap is not expected to select the text on its own but is the second step in a triple-tap. Actual Outcome: The action was the second tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' at coordinates [378, 172]. There was no visual change on the screen as a result of this action. The text \\'my_note\\' remains in the input field, and the field is still focused. The virtual keyboard is also still visible. This action did not, by itself, achieve the goal of selecting the text for deletion, but it was a planned intermediate step in the triple-tap gesture. The overall goal of clearing the text field has not yet been achieved.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the third tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. If successful, the text \\'my_note\\' will become highlighted or a context menu with options like \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Select All\\' will appear. Actual Outcome: The action was the third tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' at coordinates [378, 172]. This action failed to select the text \\'my_note\\'. No visual change occurred on the screen. The text \\'my_note\\' remains in the input field, the field is still focused, and the virtual keyboard is visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note, as the existing text could not be selected for deletion.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Attempt to delete all text from the focused \\'Name\\' input field, which currently contains \\'my_note\\'. The field has resource-id \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\\' and is confirmed to be focused with text \\'my_note\\'. If successful, the \\'my_note\\' text will be cleared from the input field, leaving it empty and ready for the new filename. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' failed. The text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\\') was not deleted. The input field remains focused with the text \\'my_note\\', and the virtual keyboard is still visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 18: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send the first of 10 `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevents to the focused \\'Name\\' input field, which currently contains \\'my_note\\'. This is an attempt to delete the existing text character by character. If successful, one character from \\'my_note\\' will be deleted. This action will be repeated 9 more times in subsequent steps if this first one is successful in deleting a character. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the first tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. This single tap is not expected to select the text on its own but is the first step in a triple-tap. Actual Outcome: The action was the first tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' at [378, 172]. No visual change occurred on the screen, which is consistent with the first tap of a multi-tap gesture. The text \\'my_note\\' is still in the input field, and the field remains focused. The virtual keyboard is still active. This action, by itself, did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, but it is a necessary step in the planned triple-tap sequence to select the text.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the second tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is part of an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. This single tap is not expected to select the text on its own but is the second step in a triple-tap. Actual Outcome: The action was the second tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' at coordinates [378, 172]. There was no visual change on the screen as a result of this action. The text \\'my_note\\' remains in the input field, and the field is still focused. The virtual keyboard is also still visible. This action did not, by itself, achieve the goal of selecting the text for deletion, but it was a planned intermediate step in the triple-tap gesture. The overall goal of clearing the text field has not yet been achieved.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the third tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. If successful, the text \\'my_note\\' will become highlighted or a context menu with options like \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Select All\\' will appear. Actual Outcome: The action was the third tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' at coordinates [378, 172]. This action failed to select the text \\'my_note\\'. No visual change occurred on the screen. The text \\'my_note\\' remains in the input field, the field is still focused, and the virtual keyboard is visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note, as the existing text could not be selected for deletion.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Attempt to delete all text from the focused \\'Name\\' input field, which currently contains \\'my_note\\'. The field has resource-id \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\\' and is confirmed to be focused with text \\'my_note\\'. If successful, the \\'my_note\\' text will be cleared from the input field, leaving it empty and ready for the new filename. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' failed. The text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\\') was not deleted. The input field remains focused with the text \\'my_note\\', and the virtual keyboard is still visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send the first of 10 `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevents to the focused \\'Name\\' input field, which currently contains \\'my_note\\'. This is an attempt to delete the existing text character by character. If successful, one character from \\'my_note\\' will be deleted. This action will be repeated 9 more times in subsequent steps if this first one is successful in deleting a character. Actual Outcome: The action `adb shell input keyevent KEYCODE_DEL` was performed. However, the text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\\') was not deleted or altered. The input field remains focused with the text \\'my_note\\', and the virtual keyboard is still visible. The action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note, as the existing text could not be cleared.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Share the entire content of the note with the phone number +13192815309 via SMS using Simple SMS Messenger\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the first tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This is an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. This single tap is not expected to select the text on its own but is the first step in a triple-tap. Actual Outcome: The action was the first tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' at [378, 172]. No visual change occurred on the screen, which is consistent with the first tap of a multi-tap gesture. The text \\'my_note\\' is still in the input field, and the field remains focused. The virtual keyboard is still active. This action, by itself, did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, but it is a necessary step in the planned triple-tap sequence to select the text.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the second tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is part of an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. This single tap is not expected to select the text on its own but is the second step in a triple-tap. Actual Outcome: The action was the second tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' at coordinates [378, 172]. There was no visual change on the screen as a result of this action. The text \\'my_note\\' remains in the input field, and the field is still focused. The virtual keyboard is also still visible. This action did not, by itself, achieve the goal of selecting the text for deletion, but it was a planned intermediate step in the triple-tap gesture. The overall goal of clearing the text field has not yet been achieved.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the third tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. If successful, the text \\'my_note\\' will become highlighted or a context menu with options like \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Select All\\' will appear. Actual Outcome: The action was the third tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' at coordinates [378, 172]. This action failed to select the text \\'my_note\\'. No visual change occurred on the screen. The text \\'my_note\\' remains in the input field, the field is still focused, and the virtual keyboard is visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note, as the existing text could not be selected for deletion.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Attempt to delete all text from the focused \\'Name\\' input field, which currently contains \\'my_note\\'. The field has resource-id \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\\' and is confirmed to be focused with text \\'my_note\\'. If successful, the \\'my_note\\' text will be cleared from the input field, leaving it empty and ready for the new filename. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' failed. The text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\\') was not deleted. The input field remains focused with the text \\'my_note\\', and the virtual keyboard is still visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send the first of 10 `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevents to the focused \\'Name\\' input field, which currently contains \\'my_note\\'. This is an attempt to delete the existing text character by character. If successful, one character from \\'my_note\\' will be deleted. This action will be repeated 9 more times in subsequent steps if this first one is successful in deleting a character. Actual Outcome: The action `adb shell input keyevent KEYCODE_DEL` was performed. However, the text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\\') was not deleted or altered. The input field remains focused with the text \\'my_note\\', and the virtual keyboard is still visible. The action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note, as the existing text could not be cleared.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 19: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[378,100],\"end_point\":[378,400],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe horizontally across the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field, from [378, 100] to [378, 400]. The name input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to select the text \\'my_note\\'. If successful, the text \\'my_note\\' will become highlighted.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Actual Outcome: The action was the second tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' at coordinates [378, 172]. There was no visual change on the screen as a result of this action. The text \\'my_note\\' remains in the input field, and the field is still focused. The virtual keyboard is also still visible. This action did not, by itself, achieve the goal of selecting the text for deletion, but it was a planned intermediate step in the triple-tap gesture. The overall goal of clearing the text field has not yet been achieved.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the third tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. If successful, the text \\'my_note\\' will become highlighted or a context menu with options like \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Select All\\' will appear. Actual Outcome: The action was the third tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' at coordinates [378, 172]. This action failed to select the text \\'my_note\\'. No visual change occurred on the screen. The text \\'my_note\\' remains in the input field, the field is still focused, and the virtual keyboard is visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note, as the existing text could not be selected for deletion.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Attempt to delete all text from the focused \\'Name\\' input field, which currently contains \\'my_note\\'. The field has resource-id \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\\' and is confirmed to be focused with text \\'my_note\\'. If successful, the \\'my_note\\' text will be cleared from the input field, leaving it empty and ready for the new filename. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' failed. The text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\\') was not deleted. The input field remains focused with the text \\'my_note\\', and the virtual keyboard is still visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send the first of 10 `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevents to the focused \\'Name\\' input field, which currently contains \\'my_note\\'. This is an attempt to delete the existing text character by character. If successful, one character from \\'my_note\\' will be deleted. This action will be repeated 9 more times in subsequent steps if this first one is successful in deleting a character. Actual Outcome: The action `adb shell input keyevent KEYCODE_DEL` was performed. However, the text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\\') was not deleted or altered. The input field remains focused with the text \\'my_note\\', and the virtual keyboard is still visible. The action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note, as the existing text could not be cleared.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[378,100],\"end_point\":[378,400],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe horizontally across the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field, from [378, 100] to [378, 400]. The name input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to select the text \\'my_note\\'. If successful, the text \\'my_note\\' will become highlighted. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [378, 100] to [378, 400] on the text \"my_note\" failed to select or modify the text. The screen remains unchanged. The text \"my_note\" is still present in the input field, and the field is focused. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note. The failure might be because a simple swipe is not the correct gesture for selection here, or the swipe coordinates were not precise enough, particularly the end x-coordinate being far beyond the text.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Share the entire content of the note with the phone number +13192815309 via SMS using Simple SMS Messenger\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the second tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is part of an attempt to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. This single tap is not expected to select the text on its own but is the second step in a triple-tap. Actual Outcome: The action was the second tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' at coordinates [378, 172]. There was no visual change on the screen as a result of this action. The text \\'my_note\\' remains in the input field, and the field is still focused. The virtual keyboard is also still visible. This action did not, by itself, achieve the goal of selecting the text for deletion, but it was a planned intermediate step in the triple-tap gesture. The overall goal of clearing the text field has not yet been achieved.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the third tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. If successful, the text \\'my_note\\' will become highlighted or a context menu with options like \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Select All\\' will appear. Actual Outcome: The action was the third tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' at coordinates [378, 172]. This action failed to select the text \\'my_note\\'. No visual change occurred on the screen. The text \\'my_note\\' remains in the input field, the field is still focused, and the virtual keyboard is visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note, as the existing text could not be selected for deletion.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Attempt to delete all text from the focused \\'Name\\' input field, which currently contains \\'my_note\\'. The field has resource-id \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\\' and is confirmed to be focused with text \\'my_note\\'. If successful, the \\'my_note\\' text will be cleared from the input field, leaving it empty and ready for the new filename. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' failed. The text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\\') was not deleted. The input field remains focused with the text \\'my_note\\', and the virtual keyboard is still visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send the first of 10 `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevents to the focused \\'Name\\' input field, which currently contains \\'my_note\\'. This is an attempt to delete the existing text character by character. If successful, one character from \\'my_note\\' will be deleted. This action will be repeated 9 more times in subsequent steps if this first one is successful in deleting a character. Actual Outcome: The action `adb shell input keyevent KEYCODE_DEL` was performed. However, the text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\\') was not deleted or altered. The input field remains focused with the text \\'my_note\\', and the virtual keyboard is still visible. The action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note, as the existing text could not be cleared.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[378,100],\"end_point\":[378,400],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe horizontally across the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field, from [378, 100] to [378, 400]. The name input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to select the text \\'my_note\\'. If successful, the text \\'my_note\\' will become highlighted. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [378, 100] to [378, 400] on the text \"my_note\" failed to select or modify the text. The screen remains unchanged. The text \"my_note\" is still present in the input field, and the field is focused. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note. The failure might be because a simple swipe is not the correct gesture for selection here, or the swipe coordinates were not precise enough, particularly the end x-coordinate being far beyond the text.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 20: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[372,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the text \\'my_note\\' (center at approximately [372, 153]) in the \\'Name\\' input field. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to bring up a context menu, hopefully with a \\'Select All\\' option, which would allow deleting the current text. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14.

If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider.

Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the third tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. If successful, the text \\'my_note\\' will become highlighted or a context menu with options like \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Select All\\' will appear. Actual Outcome: The action was the third tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' at coordinates [378, 172]. This action failed to select the text \\'my_note\\'. No visual change occurred on the screen. The text \\'my_note\\' remains in the input field, the field is still focused, and the virtual keyboard is visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note, as the existing text could not be selected for deletion.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Attempt to delete all text from the focused \\'Name\\' input field, which currently contains \\'my_note\\'. The field has resource-id \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\\' and is confirmed to be focused with text \\'my_note\\'. If successful, the \\'my_note\\' text will be cleared from the input field, leaving it empty and ready for the new filename. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' failed. The text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\\') was not deleted. The input field remains focused with the text \\'my_note\\', and the virtual keyboard is still visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send the first of 10 `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevents to the focused \\'Name\\' input field, which currently contains \\'my_note\\'. This is an attempt to delete the existing text character by character. If successful, one character from \\'my_note\\' will be deleted. This action will be repeated 9 more times in subsequent steps if this first one is successful in deleting a character. Actual Outcome: The action `adb shell input keyevent KEYCODE_DEL` was performed. However, the text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\\') was not deleted or altered. The input field remains focused with the text \\'my_note\\', and the virtual keyboard is still visible. The action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note, as the existing text could not be cleared.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[378,100],\"end_point\":[378,400],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe horizontally across the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field, from [378, 100] to [378, 400]. The name input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to select the text \\'my_note\\'. If successful, the text \\'my_note\\' will become highlighted. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [378, 100] to [378, 400] on the text \"my_note\" failed to select or modify the text. The screen remains unchanged. The text \"my_note\" is still present in the input field, and the field is focused. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note. The failure might be because a simple swipe is not the correct gesture for selection here, or the swipe coordinates were not precise enough, particularly the end x-coordinate being far beyond the text.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[372,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the text \\'my_note\\' (center at approximately [372, 153]) in the \\'Name\\' input field. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to bring up a context menu, hopefully with a \\'Select All\\' option, which would allow deleting the current text. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the text \\'my_note\\' at [372, 153] was successful. A context menu appeared above the text field. This menu displays \\'Paste\\' on the left and a three-dot icon on the right. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note, as the context menu might provide a way to select and delete the current text \\'my_note\\'.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[378,172],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Perform the third tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field at approximately [378, 172]. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to select the text \\'my_note\\' so it can be deleted. If successful, the text \\'my_note\\' will become highlighted or a context menu with options like \\'Cut\\', \\'Copy\\', \\'Select All\\' will appear. Actual Outcome: The action was the third tap of a triple-tap sequence on the text \\'my_note\\' at coordinates [378, 172]. This action failed to select the text \\'my_note\\'. No visual change occurred on the screen. The text \\'my_note\\' remains in the input field, the field is still focused, and the virtual keyboard is visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note, as the existing text could not be selected for deletion.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field.

The field has resource-id \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\\' and is confirmed to be focused with text \\'my_note\\'. If successful, the \\'my_note\\' text will be cleared from the input field, leaving it empty and ready for the new filename. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' failed. The text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\\') was not deleted. The input field remains focused with the text \\'my_note\\', and the virtual keyboard is still visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send the first of 10 `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevents to the focused \\'Name\\' input field, which currently contains \\'my_note\\'. This is an attempt to delete the existing text character by character. If successful, one character from \\'my_note\\' will be deleted. This action will be repeated 9 more times in subsequent steps if this first one is successful in deleting a character. Actual Outcome: The action `adb shell input keyevent KEYCODE_DEL` was performed. However, the text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\\') was not deleted or altered. The input field remains focused with the text \\'my_note\\', and the virtual keyboard is still visible. The action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note, as the existing text could not be cleared.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[378,100],\"end_point\":[378,400],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe horizontally across the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field, from [378, 100] to [378, 400]. The name input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to select the text \\'my_note\\'. If successful, the text \\'my_note\\' will become highlighted. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [378, 100] to [378, 400] on the text \"my_note\" failed to select or modify the text. The screen remains unchanged. The text \"my_note\" is still present in the input field, and the field is focused. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note. The failure might be because a simple swipe is not the correct gesture for selection here, or the swipe coordinates were not precise enough, particularly the end x-coordinate being far beyond the text.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[372,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the text \\'my_note\\' (center at approximately [372, 153]) in the \\'Name\\' input field. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to bring up a context menu, hopefully with a \\'Select All\\' option, which would allow deleting the current text. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the text \\'my_note\\' at [372, 153] was successful. A context menu appeared above the text field. This menu displays \\'Paste\\' on the left and a three-dot icon on the right. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note, as the context menu might provide a way to select and delete the current text \\'my_note\\'.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 21: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[405,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot icon in the context menu that appeared after long-pressing the \\'my_note\\' text. The icon is located at approximately [405, 250]. This action is expected to open a sub-menu with more options, potentially including \\'Select All\\', which is needed to clear the current filename. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Attempt to delete all text from the focused \\'Name\\' input field, which currently contains \\'my_note\\'. The field has resource-id \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\\' and is confirmed to be focused with text \\'my_note\\'. If successful, the \\'my_note\\' text will be cleared from the input field, leaving it empty and ready for the new filename. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' failed. The text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\\') was not deleted. The input field remains focused with the text \\'my_note\\', and the virtual keyboard is still visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send the first of 10 `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevents to the focused \\'Name\\' input field, which currently contains \\'my_note\\'. This is an attempt to delete the existing text character by character. If successful, one character from \\'my_note\\' will be deleted. This action will be repeated 9 more times in subsequent steps if this first one is successful in deleting a character. Actual Outcome: The action `adb shell input keyevent KEYCODE_DEL` was performed. However, the text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\\') was not deleted or altered. The input field remains focused with the text \\'my_note\\', and the virtual keyboard is still visible. The action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note, as the existing text could not be cleared.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[378,100],\"end_point\":[378,400],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe horizontally across the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field, from [378, 100] to [378, 400]. The name input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to select the text \\'my_note\\'. If successful, the text \\'my_note\\' will become highlighted. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [378, 100] to [378, 400] on the text \"my_note\" failed to select or modify the text. The screen remains unchanged. The text \"my_note\" is still present in the input field, and the field is focused. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note. The failure might be because a simple swipe is not the correct gesture for selection here, or the swipe coordinates were not precise enough, particularly the end x-coordinate being far beyond the text.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[372,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the text \\'my_note\\' (center at approximately [372, 153]) in the \\'Name\\' input field. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to bring up a context menu, hopefully with a \\'Select All\\' option, which would allow deleting the current text. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the text \\'my_note\\' at [372, 153] was successful. A context menu appeared above the text field. This menu displays \\'Paste\\' on the left and a three-dot icon on the right. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note, as the context menu might provide a way to select and delete the current text \\'my_note\\'.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[405,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot icon in the context menu that appeared after long-pressing the \\'my_note\\' text. The icon is located at approximately [405, 250]. This action is expected to open a sub-menu with more options, potentially including \\'Select All\\', which is needed to clear the current filename. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot icon (at approximately [405, 250]) in the context menu was successful. The context menu changed, now showing \\'Autofill\\' and a back arrow icon. This action explored an option for text manipulation, but \\'Select All\\' was not found. The agent is still working towards clearing the text field to name the note. The next step is to close the current \\'Autofill\\' context menu.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Share the entire content of the note with the phone number +13192815309 via SMS using Simple SMS Messenger\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Attempt to delete all text from the focused \\'Name\\' input field, which currently contains \\'my_note\\'. The field has resource-id \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\\' and is confirmed to be focused with text \\'my_note\\'. If successful, the \\'my_note\\' text will be cleared from the input field, leaving it empty and ready for the new filename. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' failed. The text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\\') was not deleted. The input field remains focused with the text \\'my_note\\', and the virtual keyboard is still visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send the first of 10 `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevents to the focused \\'Name\\' input field, which currently contains \\'my_note\\'. This is an attempt to delete the existing text character by character. If successful, one character from \\'my_note\\' will be deleted. This action will be repeated 9 more times in subsequent steps if this first one is successful in deleting a character. Actual Outcome: The action `adb shell input keyevent KEYCODE_DEL` was performed. However, the text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\\') was not deleted or altered. The input field remains focused with the text \\'my_note\\', and the virtual keyboard is still visible. The action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note, as the existing text could not be cleared.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[378,100],\"end_point\":[378,400],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe horizontally across the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field, from [378, 100] to [378, 400]. The name input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to select the text \\'my_note\\'. If successful, the text \\'my_note\\' will become highlighted. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [378, 100] to [378, 400] on the text \"my_note\" failed to select or modify the text. The screen remains unchanged. The text \"my_note\" is still present in the input field, and the field is focused. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note. The failure might be because a simple swipe is not the correct gesture for selection here, or the swipe coordinates were not precise enough, particularly the end x-coordinate being far beyond the text.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[372,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the text \\'my_note\\' (center at approximately [372, 153]) in the \\'Name\\' input field. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to bring up a context menu, hopefully with a \\'Select All\\' option, which would allow deleting the current text. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the text \\'my_note\\' at [372, 153] was successful. A context menu appeared above the text field. This menu displays \\'Paste\\' on the left and a three-dot icon on the right. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note, as the context menu might provide a way to select and delete the current text \\'my_note\\'.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[405,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot icon in the context menu that appeared after long-pressing the \\'my_note\\' text. The icon is located at approximately [405, 250]. This action is expected to open a sub-menu with more options, potentially including \\'Select All\\', which is needed to clear the current filename. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot icon (at approximately [405, 250]) in the context menu was successful. The context menu changed, now showing \\'Autofill\\' and a back arrow icon. This action explored an option for text manipulation, but \\'Select All\\' was not found. The agent is still working towards clearing the text field to name the note. The next step is to close the current \\'Autofill\\' context menu.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 22: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[400,130],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located to the left of \\'Autofill\\' in the small pop-up menu. This pop-up is currently above the \\'Name\\' input field. This action is intended to close the \\'Autofill\\' context menu. If successful, the pop-up menu will disappear, and the \\'Name\\' input field will remain focused, ready for further interaction. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action was successful, as the 'Autofill' menu disappeared, and the 'Paste' context menu (which was present before 'Autofill') reappeared. The current goal is to name the note 'fair_ant_XOdi.txt', which requires deleting the current text 'my_note'. Previous attempts to delete text directly (delete_all_text, KEYCODE_DEL) or select text (swipe) have failed. The context menu currently shown ('Paste', three-dots) does not offer a 'Select All' or 'Delete' option. Tapping the three-dots previously led to 'Autofill', which was not helpful.\\nTo proceed, the current 'Paste' context menu needs to be dismissed to allow direct interaction with the text field. The plan is to tap on the text 'my_note' within the input field. This is expected to dismiss the context menu and ensure the text field is active for editing. After (hopefully) dismissing the context menu, the `delete_all_text` action will be attempted again. If it fails, `KEYCODE_DEL` will be used multiple times as a fallback. If text deletion is successful, the new filename will be entered, the type changed to ensure a .txt extension, and then the note creation confirmed by tapping 'OK'.\", 'ActionOutcomeDescription': \"The tap on the back arrow icon (at approximately `[400,130]`) was successful. The 'Autofill' context menu closed, and the previous context menu with 'Paste' and a three-dot icon reappeared above the 'my_note' text field.

This is an attempt to delete the existing text character by character. If successful, one character from \\'my_note\\' will be deleted. This action will be repeated 9 more times in subsequent steps if this first one is successful in deleting a character. Actual Outcome: The action `adb shell input keyevent KEYCODE_DEL` was performed. However, the text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id \\'net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name\\') was not deleted or altered. The input field remains focused with the text \\'my_note\\', and the virtual keyboard is still visible. The action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note, as the existing text could not be cleared.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[378,100],\"end_point\":[378,400],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe horizontally across the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field, from [378, 100] to [378, 400]. The name input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to select the text \\'my_note\\'. If successful, the text \\'my_note\\' will become highlighted. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [378, 100] to [378, 400] on the text \"my_note\" failed to select or modify the text. The screen remains unchanged. The text \"my_note\" is still present in the input field, and the field is focused. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note. The failure might be because a simple swipe is not the correct gesture for selection here, or the swipe coordinates were not precise enough, particularly the end x-coordinate being far beyond the text.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[372,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the text \\'my_note\\' (center at approximately [372, 153]) in the \\'Name\\' input field. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to bring up a context menu, hopefully with a \\'Select All\\' option, which would allow deleting the current text. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the text \\'my_note\\' at [372, 153] was successful. A context menu appeared above the text field. This menu displays \\'Paste\\' on the left and a three-dot icon on the right. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note, as the context menu might provide a way to select and delete the current text \\'my_note\\'.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[405,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot icon in the context menu that appeared after long-pressing the \\'my_note\\' text. The icon is located at approximately [405, 250]. This action is expected to open a sub-menu with more options, potentially including \\'Select All\\', which is needed to clear the current filename. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot icon (at approximately [405, 250]) in the context menu was successful. The context menu changed, now showing \\'Autofill\\' and a back arrow icon. This action explored an option for text manipulation, but \\'Select All\\' was not found. The agent is still working towards clearing the text field to name the note. The next step is to close the current \\'Autofill\\' context menu.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[400,130],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located to the left of \\'Autofill\\' in the small pop-up menu. This pop-up is currently above the \\'Name\\' input field. This action is intended to close the \\'Autofill\\' context menu. If successful, the pop-up menu will disappear, and the \\'Name\\' input field will remain focused, ready for further interaction. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (at approximately `[400,130]`) was successful. The \\'Autofill\\' context menu closed, and the previous context menu with \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon reappeared above the \\'my_note\\' text field. This action successfully navigated back from an unhelpful menu option. However, the primary challenge of deleting the text \\'my_note\\' from the input field remains. The agent is still working towards being able to input the correct filename.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The name input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to select the text \\'my_note\\'. If successful, the text \\'my_note\\' will become highlighted. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [378, 100] to [378, 400] on the text \"my_note\" failed to select or modify the text. The screen remains unchanged. The text \"my_note\" is still present in the input field, and the field is focused. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note. The failure might be because a simple swipe is not the correct gesture for selection here, or the swipe coordinates were not precise enough, particularly the end x-coordinate being far beyond the text.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[372,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the text \\'my_note\\' (center at approximately [372, 153]) in the \\'Name\\' input field. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to bring up a context menu, hopefully with a \\'Select All\\' option, which would allow deleting the current text. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the text \\'my_note\\' at [372, 153] was successful. A context menu appeared above the text field. This menu displays \\'Paste\\' on the left and a three-dot icon on the right. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note, as the context menu might provide a way to select and delete the current text \\'my_note\\'.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[405,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot icon in the context menu that appeared after long-pressing the \\'my_note\\' text. The icon is located at approximately [405, 250]. This action is expected to open a sub-menu with more options, potentially including \\'Select All\\', which is needed to clear the current filename. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot icon (at approximately [405, 250]) in the context menu was successful. The context menu changed, now showing \\'Autofill\\' and a back arrow icon. This action explored an option for text manipulation, but \\'Select All\\' was not found. The agent is still working towards clearing the text field to name the note. The next step is to close the current \\'Autofill\\' context menu.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[400,130],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located to the left of \\'Autofill\\' in the small pop-up menu. This pop-up is currently above the \\'Name\\' input field. This action is intended to close the \\'Autofill\\' context menu. If successful, the pop-up menu will disappear, and the \\'Name\\' input field will remain focused, ready for further interaction. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (at approximately `[400,130]`) was successful. The \\'Autofill\\' context menu closed, and the previous context menu with \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon reappeared above the \\'my_note\\' text field. This action successfully navigated back from an unhelpful menu option. However, the primary challenge of deleting the text \\'my_note\\' from the input field remains. The agent is still working towards being able to input the correct filename.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 23: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[370,150],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'my_note\\' (approximately at `[370, 150]`) in the \\'Name\\' input field. This input field currently has a context menu (\\'Paste\\', three-dots) active above it. This tap is intended to dismiss the context menu and ensure the input field is ready for text deletion and input. If successful, the context menu will disappear, and the cursor should remain in the \\'Name\\' field. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the text \\'my_note\\' at [372, 153] was successful. A context menu appeared above the text field. This menu displays \\'Paste\\' on the left and a three-dot icon on the right. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note, as the context menu might provide a way to select and delete the current text \\'my_note\\'.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[405,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot icon in the context menu that appeared after long-pressing the \\'my_note\\' text. The icon is located at approximately [405, 250]. This action is expected to open a sub-menu with more options, potentially including \\'Select All\\', which is needed to clear the current filename. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot icon (at approximately [405, 250]) in the context menu was successful. The context menu changed, now showing \\'Autofill\\' and a back arrow icon. This action explored an option for text manipulation, but \\'Select All\\' was not found. The agent is still working towards clearing the text field to name the note. The next step is to close the current \\'Autofill\\' context menu.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[400,130],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located to the left of \\'Autofill\\' in the small pop-up menu. This pop-up is currently above the \\'Name\\' input field. This action is intended to close the \\'Autofill\\' context menu. If successful, the pop-up menu will disappear, and the \\'Name\\' input field will remain focused, ready for further interaction. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (at approximately `[400,130]`) was successful. The \\'Autofill\\' context menu closed, and the previous context menu with \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon reappeared above the \\'my_note\\' text field. This action successfully navigated back from an unhelpful menu option. However, the primary challenge of deleting the text \\'my_note\\' from the input field remains. The agent is still working towards being able to input the correct filename.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[370,150],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'my_note\\' (approximately at `[370, 150]`) in the \\'Name\\' input field. This input field currently has a context menu (\\'Paste\\', three-dots) active above it. This tap is intended to dismiss the context menu and ensure the input field is ready for text deletion and input. If successful, the context menu will disappear, and the cursor should remain in the \\'Name\\' field. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the text \\'my_note\\' (at approximately `[370, 150]`) was successful. The context menu that was previously visible above the \\'Name\\' input field (containing \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon) has disappeared. The \\'Name\\' input field remains focused, containing the text \\'my_note\\', and the virtual keyboard is still visible. This action successfully prepared the input field for text deletion by removing the overlaying context menu, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Share the entire content of the note with the phone number +13192815309 via SMS using Simple SMS Messenger\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[378,100],\"end_point\":[378,400],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe horizontally across the text \\'my_note\\' in the name input field, from [378, 100] to [378, 400]. The name input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to select the text \\'my_note\\'. If successful, the text \\'my_note\\' will become highlighted. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [378, 100] to [378, 400] on the text \"my_note\" failed to select or modify the text. The screen remains unchanged. The text \"my_note\" is still present in the input field, and the field is focused. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note. The failure might be because a simple swipe is not the correct gesture for selection here, or the swipe coordinates were not precise enough, particularly the end x-coordinate being far beyond the text.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[372,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the text \\'my_note\\' (center at approximately [372, 153]) in the \\'Name\\' input field. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to bring up a context menu, hopefully with a \\'Select All\\' option, which would allow deleting the current text. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the text \\'my_note\\' at [372, 153] was successful. A context menu appeared above the text field. This menu displays \\'Paste\\' on the left and a three-dot icon on the right. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note, as the context menu might provide a way to select and delete the current text \\'my_note\\'.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[405,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot icon in the context menu that appeared after long-pressing the \\'my_note\\' text. The icon is located at approximately [405, 250]. This action is expected to open a sub-menu with more options, potentially including \\'Select All\\', which is needed to clear the current filename. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot icon (at approximately [405, 250]) in the context menu was successful. The context menu changed, now showing \\'Autofill\\' and a back arrow icon. This action explored an option for text manipulation, but \\'Select All\\' was not found. The agent is still working towards clearing the text field to name the note. The next step is to close the current \\'Autofill\\' context menu.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[400,130],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located to the left of \\'Autofill\\' in the small pop-up menu. This pop-up is currently above the \\'Name\\' input field. This action is intended to close the \\'Autofill\\' context menu. If successful, the pop-up menu will disappear, and the \\'Name\\' input field will remain focused, ready for further interaction. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (at approximately `[400,130]`) was successful. The \\'Autofill\\' context menu closed, and the previous context menu with \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon reappeared above the \\'my_note\\' text field. This action successfully navigated back from an unhelpful menu option. However, the primary challenge of deleting the text \\'my_note\\' from the input field remains. The agent is still working towards being able to input the correct filename.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[370,150],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'my_note\\' (approximately at `[370, 150]`) in the \\'Name\\' input field. This input field currently has a context menu (\\'Paste\\', three-dots) active above it. This tap is intended to dismiss the context menu and ensure the input field is ready for text deletion and input. If successful, the context menu will disappear, and the cursor should remain in the \\'Name\\' field. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the text \\'my_note\\' (at approximately `[370, 150]`) was successful. The context menu that was previously visible above the \\'Name\\' input field (containing \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon) has disappeared. The \\'Name\\' input field remains focused, containing the text \\'my_note\\', and the virtual keyboard is still visible. This action successfully prepared the input field for text deletion by removing the overlaying context menu, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 24: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Attempt to delete all text (\\'my_note\\') from the currently focused \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name` and currently contains \\'my_note\\'. If successful, the \\'Name\\' field will be empty, ready for the new filename input. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider.

For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[372,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the text \\'my_note\\' (center at approximately [372, 153]) in the \\'Name\\' input field. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to bring up a context menu, hopefully with a \\'Select All\\' option, which would allow deleting the current text. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the text \\'my_note\\' at [372, 153] was successful. A context menu appeared above the text field. This menu displays \\'Paste\\' on the left and a three-dot icon on the right. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note, as the context menu might provide a way to select and delete the current text \\'my_note\\'.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[405,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot icon in the context menu that appeared after long-pressing the \\'my_note\\' text. The icon is located at approximately [405, 250]. This action is expected to open a sub-menu with more options, potentially including \\'Select All\\', which is needed to clear the current filename. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot icon (at approximately [405, 250]) in the context menu was successful. The context menu changed, now showing \\'Autofill\\' and a back arrow icon. This action explored an option for text manipulation, but \\'Select All\\' was not found. The agent is still working towards clearing the text field to name the note. The next step is to close the current \\'Autofill\\' context menu.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[400,130],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located to the left of \\'Autofill\\' in the small pop-up menu. This pop-up is currently above the \\'Name\\' input field. This action is intended to close the \\'Autofill\\' context menu. If successful, the pop-up menu will disappear, and the \\'Name\\' input field will remain focused, ready for further interaction. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (at approximately `[400,130]`) was successful. The \\'Autofill\\' context menu closed, and the previous context menu with \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon reappeared above the \\'my_note\\' text field. This action successfully navigated back from an unhelpful menu option. However, the primary challenge of deleting the text \\'my_note\\' from the input field remains. The agent is still working towards being able to input the correct filename.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[370,150],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'my_note\\' (approximately at `[370, 150]`) in the \\'Name\\' input field. This input field currently has a context menu (\\'Paste\\', three-dots) active above it. This tap is intended to dismiss the context menu and ensure the input field is ready for text deletion and input. If successful, the context menu will disappear, and the cursor should remain in the \\'Name\\' field. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the text \\'my_note\\' (at approximately `[370, 150]`) was successful. The context menu that was previously visible above the \\'Name\\' input field (containing \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon) has disappeared. The \\'Name\\' input field remains focused, containing the text \\'my_note\\', and the virtual keyboard is still visible. This action successfully prepared the input field for text deletion by removing the overlaying context menu, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Attempt to delete all text (\\'my_note\\') from the currently focused \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name` and currently contains \\'my_note\\'. If successful, the \\'Name\\' field will be empty, ready for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The `delete_all_text` action failed. The text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' input field (`net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) was not deleted. The input field remains focused with the text \\'my_note\\', and the virtual keyboard is still visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note. The next step will be to attempt deleting the text character by character using `KEYCODE_DEL` events.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Share the entire content of the note with the phone number +13192815309 via SMS using Simple SMS Messenger\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[372,153],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the text \\'my_note\\' (center at approximately [372, 153]) in the \\'Name\\' input field. The input field is currently focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to bring up a context menu, hopefully with a \\'Select All\\' option, which would allow deleting the current text. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on the text \\'my_note\\' at [372, 153] was successful. A context menu appeared above the text field. This menu displays \\'Paste\\' on the left and a three-dot icon on the right. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note, as the context menu might provide a way to select and delete the current text \\'my_note\\'.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[405,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot icon in the context menu that appeared after long-pressing the \\'my_note\\' text. The icon is located at approximately [405, 250]. This action is expected to open a sub-menu with more options, potentially including \\'Select All\\', which is needed to clear the current filename. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot icon (at approximately [405, 250]) in the context menu was successful. The context menu changed, now showing \\'Autofill\\' and a back arrow icon. This action explored an option for text manipulation, but \\'Select All\\' was not found. The agent is still working towards clearing the text field to name the note. The next step is to close the current \\'Autofill\\' context menu.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[400,130],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located to the left of \\'Autofill\\' in the small pop-up menu. This pop-up is currently above the \\'Name\\' input field. This action is intended to close the \\'Autofill\\' context menu. If successful, the pop-up menu will disappear, and the \\'Name\\' input field will remain focused, ready for further interaction. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (at approximately `[400,130]`) was successful. The \\'Autofill\\' context menu closed, and the previous context menu with \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon reappeared above the \\'my_note\\' text field. This action successfully navigated back from an unhelpful menu option. However, the primary challenge of deleting the text \\'my_note\\' from the input field remains. The agent is still working towards being able to input the correct filename.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[370,150],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'my_note\\' (approximately at `[370, 150]`) in the \\'Name\\' input field. This input field currently has a context menu (\\'Paste\\', three-dots) active above it. This tap is intended to dismiss the context menu and ensure the input field is ready for text deletion and input. If successful, the context menu will disappear, and the cursor should remain in the \\'Name\\' field. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the text \\'my_note\\' (at approximately `[370, 150]`) was successful. The context menu that was previously visible above the \\'Name\\' input field (containing \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon) has disappeared. The \\'Name\\' input field remains focused, containing the text \\'my_note\\', and the virtual keyboard is still visible. This action successfully prepared the input field for text deletion by removing the overlaying context menu, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Attempt to delete all text (\\'my_note\\') from the currently focused \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name` and currently contains \\'my_note\\'. If successful, the \\'Name\\' field will be empty, ready for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The `delete_all_text` action failed. The text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' input field (`net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) was not deleted. The input field remains focused with the text \\'my_note\\', and the virtual keyboard is still visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note. The next step will be to attempt deleting the text character by character using `KEYCODE_DEL` events.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 25: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevent. The \\'Name\\' input field is focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to delete the last character \\'e\\' from \\'my_note\\', resulting in \\'my_not\\'. This is the first of 7 planned `KEYCODE_DEL` events to clear the field.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The icon is located at approximately [405, 250]. This action is expected to open a sub-menu with more options, potentially including \\'Select All\\', which is needed to clear the current filename. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot icon (at approximately [405, 250]) in the context menu was successful. The context menu changed, now showing \\'Autofill\\' and a back arrow icon. This action explored an option for text manipulation, but \\'Select All\\' was not found. The agent is still working towards clearing the text field to name the note. The next step is to close the current \\'Autofill\\' context menu.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[400,130],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located to the left of \\'Autofill\\' in the small pop-up menu. This pop-up is currently above the \\'Name\\' input field. This action is intended to close the \\'Autofill\\' context menu. If successful, the pop-up menu will disappear, and the \\'Name\\' input field will remain focused, ready for further interaction. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (at approximately `[400,130]`) was successful. The \\'Autofill\\' context menu closed, and the previous context menu with \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon reappeared above the \\'my_note\\' text field. This action successfully navigated back from an unhelpful menu option. However, the primary challenge of deleting the text \\'my_note\\' from the input field remains. The agent is still working towards being able to input the correct filename.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[370,150],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'my_note\\' (approximately at `[370, 150]`) in the \\'Name\\' input field. This input field currently has a context menu (\\'Paste\\', three-dots) active above it. This tap is intended to dismiss the context menu and ensure the input field is ready for text deletion and input. If successful, the context menu will disappear, and the cursor should remain in the \\'Name\\' field. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the text \\'my_note\\' (at approximately `[370, 150]`) was successful. The context menu that was previously visible above the \\'Name\\' input field (containing \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon) has disappeared. The \\'Name\\' input field remains focused, containing the text \\'my_note\\', and the virtual keyboard is still visible. This action successfully prepared the input field for text deletion by removing the overlaying context menu, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Attempt to delete all text (\\'my_note\\') from the currently focused \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name` and currently contains \\'my_note\\'. If successful, the \\'Name\\' field will be empty, ready for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The `delete_all_text` action failed. The text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' input field (`net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) was not deleted. The input field remains focused with the text \\'my_note\\', and the virtual keyboard is still visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note. The next step will be to attempt deleting the text character by character using `KEYCODE_DEL` events.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevent. The \\'Name\\' input field is focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to delete the last character \\'e\\' from \\'my_note\\', resulting in \\'my_not\\'. This is the first of 7 planned `KEYCODE_DEL` events to clear the field. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_DEL` action failed. The text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' input field (`net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) was not deleted. The input field remains focused with the text \\'my_note\\', and the virtual keyboard is still visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the inability to modify the filename is a critical blocker.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Share the entire content of the note with the phone number +13192815309 via SMS using Simple SMS Messenger\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[405,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot icon in the context menu that appeared after long-pressing the \\'my_note\\' text. The icon is located at approximately [405, 250]. This action is expected to open a sub-menu with more options, potentially including \\'Select All\\', which is needed to clear the current filename. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot icon (at approximately [405, 250]) in the context menu was successful. The context menu changed, now showing \\'Autofill\\' and a back arrow icon. This action explored an option for text manipulation, but \\'Select All\\' was not found. The agent is still working towards clearing the text field to name the note. The next step is to close the current \\'Autofill\\' context menu.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[400,130],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located to the left of \\'Autofill\\' in the small pop-up menu. This pop-up is currently above the \\'Name\\' input field. This action is intended to close the \\'Autofill\\' context menu. If successful, the pop-up menu will disappear, and the \\'Name\\' input field will remain focused, ready for further interaction. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (at approximately `[400,130]`) was successful. The \\'Autofill\\' context menu closed, and the previous context menu with \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon reappeared above the \\'my_note\\' text field. This action successfully navigated back from an unhelpful menu option. However, the primary challenge of deleting the text \\'my_note\\' from the input field remains. The agent is still working towards being able to input the correct filename.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[370,150],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'my_note\\' (approximately at `[370, 150]`) in the \\'Name\\' input field. This input field currently has a context menu (\\'Paste\\', three-dots) active above it. This tap is intended to dismiss the context menu and ensure the input field is ready for text deletion and input. If successful, the context menu will disappear, and the cursor should remain in the \\'Name\\' field. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the text \\'my_note\\' (at approximately `[370, 150]`) was successful. The context menu that was previously visible above the \\'Name\\' input field (containing \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon) has disappeared. The \\'Name\\' input field remains focused, containing the text \\'my_note\\', and the virtual keyboard is still visible. This action successfully prepared the input field for text deletion by removing the overlaying context menu, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Attempt to delete all text (\\'my_note\\') from the currently focused \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name` and currently contains \\'my_note\\'. If successful, the \\'Name\\' field will be empty, ready for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The `delete_all_text` action failed. The text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' input field (`net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) was not deleted. The input field remains focused with the text \\'my_note\\', and the virtual keyboard is still visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note. The next step will be to attempt deleting the text character by character using `KEYCODE_DEL` events.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevent. The \\'Name\\' input field is focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to delete the last character \\'e\\' from \\'my_note\\', resulting in \\'my_not\\'. This is the first of 7 planned `KEYCODE_DEL` events to clear the field. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_DEL` action failed. The text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' input field (`net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) was not deleted. The input field remains focused with the text \\'my_note\\', and the virtual keyboard is still visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the inability to modify the filename is a critical blocker.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 26: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"X\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the character \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`, currently contains \\'my_note\\', and is focused. This action will test if the input field is responsive to text input. If successful, the text in the field will become \\'my_noteX\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[400,130],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located to the left of \\'Autofill\\' in the small pop-up menu. This pop-up is currently above the \\'Name\\' input field. This action is intended to close the \\'Autofill\\' context menu. If successful, the pop-up menu will disappear, and the \\'Name\\' input field will remain focused, ready for further interaction. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (at approximately `[400,130]`) was successful. The \\'Autofill\\' context menu closed, and the previous context menu with \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon reappeared above the \\'my_note\\' text field. This action successfully navigated back from an unhelpful menu option. However, the primary challenge of deleting the text \\'my_note\\' from the input field remains. The agent is still working towards being able to input the correct filename.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[370,150],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'my_note\\' (approximately at `[370, 150]`) in the \\'Name\\' input field. This input field currently has a context menu (\\'Paste\\', three-dots) active above it. This tap is intended to dismiss the context menu and ensure the input field is ready for text deletion and input. If successful, the context menu will disappear, and the cursor should remain in the \\'Name\\' field. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the text \\'my_note\\' (at approximately `[370, 150]`) was successful. The context menu that was previously visible above the \\'Name\\' input field (containing \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon) has disappeared. The \\'Name\\' input field remains focused, containing the text \\'my_note\\', and the virtual keyboard is still visible. This action successfully prepared the input field for text deletion by removing the overlaying context menu, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Attempt to delete all text (\\'my_note\\') from the currently focused \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name` and currently contains \\'my_note\\'. If successful, the \\'Name\\' field will be empty, ready for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The `delete_all_text` action failed. The text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' input field (`net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) was not deleted. The input field remains focused with the text \\'my_note\\', and the virtual keyboard is still visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note. The next step will be to attempt deleting the text character by character using `KEYCODE_DEL` events.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevent. The \\'Name\\' input field is focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to delete the last character \\'e\\' from \\'my_note\\', resulting in \\'my_not\\'. This is the first of 7 planned `KEYCODE_DEL` events to clear the field. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_DEL` action failed. The text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' input field (`net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) was not deleted. The input field remains focused with the text \\'my_note\\', and the virtual keyboard is still visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the inability to modify the filename is a critical blocker.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"X\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the character \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`, currently contains \\'my_note\\', and is focused. This action will test if the input field is responsive to text input. If successful, the text in the field will become \\'my_noteX\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field was successful. Instead of appending \\'X\\' to \\'my_note\\', the action replaced the entire content of the field with \\'X\\'. This is a highly beneficial outcome because it means the field is responsive to text input and the previous, undeletable text \\'my_note\\' has been effectively cleared. The agent is now significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note. The next step is to input the actual desired filename.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"X\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance.

This pop-up is currently above the \\'Name\\' input field. This action is intended to close the \\'Autofill\\' context menu. If successful, the pop-up menu will disappear, and the \\'Name\\' input field will remain focused, ready for further interaction. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (at approximately `[400,130]`) was successful. The \\'Autofill\\' context menu closed, and the previous context menu with \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon reappeared above the \\'my_note\\' text field. This action successfully navigated back from an unhelpful menu option. However, the primary challenge of deleting the text \\'my_note\\' from the input field remains.

This input field currently has a context menu (\\'Paste\\', three-dots) active above it. This tap is intended to dismiss the context menu and ensure the input field is ready for text deletion and input. If successful, the context menu will disappear, and the cursor should remain in the \\'Name\\' field. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the text \\'my_note\\' (at approximately `[370, 150]`) was successful. The context menu that was previously visible above the \\'Name\\' input field (containing \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon) has disappeared. The \\'Name\\' input field remains focused, containing the text \\'my_note\\', and the virtual keyboard is still visible. This action successfully prepared the input field for text deletion by removing the overlaying context menu, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Attempt to delete all text (\\'my_note\\') from the currently focused \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name` and currently contains \\'my_note\\'. If successful, the \\'Name\\' field will be empty, ready for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The `delete_all_text` action failed. The text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' input field (`net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) was not deleted. The input field remains focused with the text \\'my_note\\', and the virtual keyboard is still visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note. The next step will be to attempt deleting the text character by character using `KEYCODE_DEL` events.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevent. The \\'Name\\' input field is focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to delete the last character \\'e\\' from \\'my_note\\', resulting in \\'my_not\\'. This is the first of 7 planned `KEYCODE_DEL` events to clear the field. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_DEL` action failed. The text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' input field (`net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) was not deleted. The input field remains focused with the text \\'my_note\\', and the virtual keyboard is still visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the inability to modify the filename is a critical blocker.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"X\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the character \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`, currently contains \\'my_note\\', and is focused. This action will test if the input field is responsive to text input. If successful, the text in the field will become \\'my_noteX\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field was successful. Instead of appending \\'X\\' to \\'my_note\\', the action replaced the entire content of the field with \\'X\\'. This is a highly beneficial outcome because it means the field is responsive to text input and the previous, undeletable text \\'my_note\\' has been effectively cleared. The agent is now significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note. The next step is to input the actual desired filename.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 27: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"fair_ant_XOdi\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`, currently contains \\'X\\', and is focused. This action should replace \\'X\\' with \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'. If successful, the \\'Name\\' field will contain \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This input field currently has a context menu (\\'Paste\\', three-dots) active above it. This tap is intended to dismiss the context menu and ensure the input field is ready for text deletion and input. If successful, the context menu will disappear, and the cursor should remain in the \\'Name\\' field. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the text \\'my_note\\' (at approximately `[370, 150]`) was successful. The context menu that was previously visible above the \\'Name\\' input field (containing \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon) has disappeared.

Actual Outcome: The `delete_all_text` action failed. The text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' input field (`net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) was not deleted. The input field remains focused with the text \\'my_note\\', and the virtual keyboard is still visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note. The next step will be to attempt deleting the text character by character using `KEYCODE_DEL` events.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevent. The \\'Name\\' input field is focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to delete the last character \\'e\\' from \\'my_note\\', resulting in \\'my_not\\'. This is the first of 7 planned `KEYCODE_DEL` events to clear the field. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_DEL` action failed. The text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' input field (`net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) was not deleted. The input field remains focused with the text \\'my_note\\', and the virtual keyboard is still visible.

The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`, currently contains \\'my_note\\', and is focused. This action will test if the input field is responsive to text input. If successful, the text in the field will become \\'my_noteX\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field was successful. Instead of appending \\'X\\' to \\'my_note\\', the action replaced the entire content of the field with \\'X\\'. This is a highly beneficial outcome because it means the field is responsive to text input and the previous, undeletable text \\'my_note\\' has been effectively cleared. The agent is now significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note. The next step is to input the actual desired filename.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"fair_ant_XOdi\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`, currently contains \\'X\\', and is focused. This action should replace \\'X\\' with \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'. If successful, the \\'Name\\' field will contain \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\' into the \\'Name\\' field, which contained \\'X\\', resulted in the text \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\'. The input was appended rather than replacing the existing content. Therefore, the filename is currently incorrect (\\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\' instead of \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'). The action brought the agent closer by inputting the characters of the filename, but a correction is needed. The text field remains focused.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"Xfair_ant_XOdi\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Share the entire content of the note with the phone number +13192815309 via SMS using Simple SMS Messenger\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[370,150],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'my_note\\' (approximately at `[370, 150]`) in the \\'Name\\' input field. This input field currently has a context menu (\\'Paste\\', three-dots) active above it. This tap is intended to dismiss the context menu and ensure the input field is ready for text deletion and input. If successful, the context menu will disappear, and the cursor should remain in the \\'Name\\' field. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the text \\'my_note\\' (at approximately `[370, 150]`) was successful. The context menu that was previously visible above the \\'Name\\' input field (containing \\'Paste\\' and a three-dot icon) has disappeared. The \\'Name\\' input field remains focused, containing the text \\'my_note\\', and the virtual keyboard is still visible. This action successfully prepared the input field for text deletion by removing the overlaying context menu, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Attempt to delete all text (\\'my_note\\') from the currently focused \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name` and currently contains \\'my_note\\'. If successful, the \\'Name\\' field will be empty, ready for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The `delete_all_text` action failed. The text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' input field (`net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) was not deleted. The input field remains focused with the text \\'my_note\\', and the virtual keyboard is still visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note. The next step will be to attempt deleting the text character by character using `KEYCODE_DEL` events.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevent. The \\'Name\\' input field is focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to delete the last character \\'e\\' from \\'my_note\\', resulting in \\'my_not\\'. This is the first of 7 planned `KEYCODE_DEL` events to clear the field. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_DEL` action failed. The text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' input field (`net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) was not deleted. The input field remains focused with the text \\'my_note\\', and the virtual keyboard is still visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the inability to modify the filename is a critical blocker.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"X\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the character \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`, currently contains \\'my_note\\', and is focused. This action will test if the input field is responsive to text input. If successful, the text in the field will become \\'my_noteX\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field was successful. Instead of appending \\'X\\' to \\'my_note\\', the action replaced the entire content of the field with \\'X\\'. This is a highly beneficial outcome because it means the field is responsive to text input and the previous, undeletable text \\'my_note\\' has been effectively cleared. The agent is now significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note. The next step is to input the actual desired filename.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"fair_ant_XOdi\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`, currently contains \\'X\\', and is focused. This action should replace \\'X\\' with \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'. If successful, the \\'Name\\' field will contain \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\' into the \\'Name\\' field, which contained \\'X\\', resulted in the text \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\'. The input was appended rather than replacing the existing content. Therefore, the filename is currently incorrect (\\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\' instead of \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'). The action brought the agent closer by inputting the characters of the filename, but a correction is needed. The text field remains focused.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 28: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"X\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the character \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`, currently contains \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\', and is focused. This action is intended to replace the current content \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\' with \\'X\\', based on the behavior observed in Step 26. If successful, the field will contain \\'X\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Attempt to delete all text (\\'my_note\\') from the currently focused \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name` and currently contains \\'my_note\\'. If successful, the \\'Name\\' field will be empty, ready for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The `delete_all_text` action failed. The text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' input field (`net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) was not deleted. The input field remains focused with the text \\'my_note\\', and the virtual keyboard is still visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note. The next step will be to attempt deleting the text character by character using `KEYCODE_DEL` events.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevent. The \\'Name\\' input field is focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to delete the last character \\'e\\' from \\'my_note\\', resulting in \\'my_not\\'. This is the first of 7 planned `KEYCODE_DEL` events to clear the field. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_DEL` action failed. The text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' input field (`net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) was not deleted. The input field remains focused with the text \\'my_note\\', and the virtual keyboard is still visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the inability to modify the filename is a critical blocker.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"X\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the character \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`, currently contains \\'my_note\\', and is focused. This action will test if the input field is responsive to text input. If successful, the text in the field will become \\'my_noteX\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field was successful. Instead of appending \\'X\\' to \\'my_note\\', the action replaced the entire content of the field with \\'X\\'. This is a highly beneficial outcome because it means the field is responsive to text input and the previous, undeletable text \\'my_note\\' has been effectively cleared. The agent is now significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note. The next step is to input the actual desired filename.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"fair_ant_XOdi\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`, currently contains \\'X\\', and is focused. This action should replace \\'X\\' with \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'. If successful, the \\'Name\\' field will contain \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\' into the \\'Name\\' field, which contained \\'X\\', resulted in the text \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\'. The input was appended rather than replacing the existing content. Therefore, the filename is currently incorrect (\\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\' instead of \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'). The action brought the agent closer by inputting the characters of the filename, but a correction is needed. The text field remains focused.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"X\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the character \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`, currently contains \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\', and is focused. This action is intended to replace the current content \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\' with \\'X\\', based on the behavior observed in Step 26. If successful, the field will contain \\'X\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field, which previously contained \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\', resulted in the text \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\'. The input \\'X\\' was appended to the existing string, rather than replacing it as hoped. This outcome moves the agent further from the goal of setting the filename to \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'. The text field remains focused. A correction is necessary.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"Xfair_ant_XOdiX\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name` and currently contains \\'my_note\\'. If successful, the \\'Name\\' field will be empty, ready for the new filename input.

The input field remains focused with the text \\'my_note\\', and the virtual keyboard is still visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the inability to modify the filename is a critical blocker.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"X\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the character \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`, currently contains \\'my_note\\', and is focused. This action will test if the input field is responsive to text input. If successful, the text in the field will become \\'my_noteX\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field was successful. Instead of appending \\'X\\' to \\'my_note\\', the action replaced the entire content of the field with \\'X\\'. This is a highly beneficial outcome because it means the field is responsive to text input and the previous, undeletable text \\'my_note\\' has been effectively cleared. The agent is now significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note. The next step is to input the actual desired filename.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"fair_ant_XOdi\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`, currently contains \\'X\\', and is focused. This action should replace \\'X\\' with \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'. If successful, the \\'Name\\' field will contain \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\' into the \\'Name\\' field, which contained \\'X\\', resulted in the text \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\'. The input was appended rather than replacing the existing content. Therefore, the filename is currently incorrect (\\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\' instead of \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'). The action brought the agent closer by inputting the characters of the filename, but a correction is needed. The text field remains focused.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"X\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the character \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`, currently contains \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\', and is focused. This action is intended to replace the current content \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\' with \\'X\\', based on the behavior observed in Step 26. If successful, the field will contain \\'X\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field, which previously contained \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\', resulted in the text \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\'. The input \\'X\\' was appended to the existing string, rather than replacing it as hoped. This outcome moves the agent further from the goal of setting the filename to \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'. The text field remains focused. A correction is necessary.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 29: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

The tap coordinates are `[381, 346]`, which is the center of the input field based on the provided bounds `[369,84,392,607]`. This action is intended to select all text within the input field, so that the subsequent text input will replace the current content. The field is expected to remain focused.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The agent is now significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note. The next step is to input the actual desired filename.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"fair_ant_XOdi\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`, currently contains \\'X\\', and is focused. This action should replace \\'X\\' with \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'. If successful, the \\'Name\\' field will contain \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\' into the \\'Name\\' field, which contained \\'X\\', resulted in the text \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\'. The input was appended rather than replacing the existing content. Therefore, the filename is currently incorrect (\\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\' instead of \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'). The action brought the agent closer by inputting the characters of the filename, but a correction is needed. The text field remains focused.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"X\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the character \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`, currently contains \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\', and is focused. This action is intended to replace the current content \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\' with \\'X\\', based on the behavior observed in Step 26. If successful, the field will contain \\'X\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field, which previously contained \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\', resulted in the text \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\'. The input \\'X\\' was appended to the existing string, rather than replacing it as hoped. This outcome moves the agent further from the goal of setting the filename to \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'. The text field remains focused. A correction is necessary.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[381,346],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' input field, which currently contains \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\' and is focused. The tap coordinates are `[381, 346]`, which is the center of the input field based on the provided bounds `[369,84,392,607]`. This action is intended to select all text within the input field, so that the subsequent text input will replace the current content. The field is expected to remain focused. Actual Outcome: The tap action was performed on the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`), which contained \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\' and was focused. The goal was to select all text in the field. However, there is no visual indication that the text was selected, as the content \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\' remains unchanged. The action did not bring the agent closer to correcting the filename because the text was not cleared or prepared for replacement. The next action must focus on clearing or correctly setting the filename.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"Xfair_ant_XOdiX\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Share the entire content of the note with the phone number +13192815309 via SMS using Simple SMS Messenger\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a `KEYCODE_DEL` keyevent. The \\'Name\\' input field is focused and contains \\'my_note\\'. This action is intended to delete the last character \\'e\\' from \\'my_note\\', resulting in \\'my_not\\'. This is the first of 7 planned `KEYCODE_DEL` events to clear the field. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_DEL` action failed. The text \\'my_note\\' in the \\'Name\\' input field (`net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`) was not deleted. The input field remains focused with the text \\'my_note\\', and the virtual keyboard is still visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the inability to modify the filename is a critical blocker.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"X\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the character \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`, currently contains \\'my_note\\', and is focused. This action will test if the input field is responsive to text input. If successful, the text in the field will become \\'my_noteX\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field was successful. Instead of appending \\'X\\' to \\'my_note\\', the action replaced the entire content of the field with \\'X\\'. This is a highly beneficial outcome because it means the field is responsive to text input and the previous, undeletable text \\'my_note\\' has been effectively cleared. The agent is now significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note. The next step is to input the actual desired filename.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"fair_ant_XOdi\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`, currently contains \\'X\\', and is focused. This action should replace \\'X\\' with \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'. If successful, the \\'Name\\' field will contain \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\' into the \\'Name\\' field, which contained \\'X\\', resulted in the text \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\'. The input was appended rather than replacing the existing content. Therefore, the filename is currently incorrect (\\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\' instead of \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'). The action brought the agent closer by inputting the characters of the filename, but a correction is needed. The text field remains focused.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"X\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the character \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`, currently contains \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\', and is focused. This action is intended to replace the current content \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\' with \\'X\\', based on the behavior observed in Step 26. If successful, the field will contain \\'X\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field, which previously contained \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\', resulted in the text \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\'. The input \\'X\\' was appended to the existing string, rather than replacing it as hoped. This outcome moves the agent further from the goal of setting the filename to \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'. The text field remains focused. A correction is necessary.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[381,346],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' input field, which currently contains \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\' and is focused. The tap coordinates are `[381, 346]`, which is the center of the input field based on the provided bounds `[369,84,392,607]`. This action is intended to select all text within the input field, so that the subsequent text input will replace the current content. The field is expected to remain focused. Actual Outcome: The tap action was performed on the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`), which contained \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\' and was focused. The goal was to select all text in the field. However, there is no visual indication that the text was selected, as the content \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\' remains unchanged. The action did not bring the agent closer to correcting the filename because the text was not cleared or prepared for replacement. The next action must focus on clearing or correctly setting the filename.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 30: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text in the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`). The field is currently focused and contains \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\'. This action will clear the field, making it ready for the correct filename input. The field is expected to remain focused and become empty. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The action did not clear the field as expected; instead, it changed the field's content to 'my_note'. This is an unexpected behavior for `delete_all_text` but it reverts the field to a state ('my_note') that was previously encountered. In Step 26, when the field contained 'my_note', inputting 'X' successfully replaced the entire content with 'X'. This suggests a viable strategy: first input 'X' to hopefully replace 'my_note', and then input the desired filename 'fair_ant_XOdi' to hopefully replace 'X'.

The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`, currently contains \\'my_note\\', and is focused. This action will test if the input field is responsive to text input. If successful, the text in the field will become \\'my_noteX\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field was successful. Instead of appending \\'X\\' to \\'my_note\\', the action replaced the entire content of the field with \\'X\\'. This is a highly beneficial outcome because it means the field is responsive to text input and the previous, undeletable text \\'my_note\\' has been effectively cleared. The agent is now significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note. The next step is to input the actual desired filename.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"fair_ant_XOdi\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`, currently contains \\'X\\', and is focused. This action should replace \\'X\\' with \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'. If successful, the \\'Name\\' field will contain \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\' into the \\'Name\\' field, which contained \\'X\\', resulted in the text \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\'. The input was appended rather than replacing the existing content. Therefore, the filename is currently incorrect (\\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\' instead of \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'). The action brought the agent closer by inputting the characters of the filename, but a correction is needed. The text field remains focused.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"X\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the character \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`, currently contains \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\', and is focused. This action is intended to replace the current content \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\' with \\'X\\', based on the behavior observed in Step 26. If successful, the field will contain \\'X\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field, which previously contained \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\', resulted in the text \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\'. The input \\'X\\' was appended to the existing string, rather than replacing it as hoped. This outcome moves the agent further from the goal of setting the filename to \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'. The text field remains focused. A correction is necessary.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[381,346],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' input field, which currently contains \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\' and is focused. The tap coordinates are `[381, 346]`, which is the center of the input field based on the provided bounds `[369,84,392,607]`. This action is intended to select all text within the input field, so that the subsequent text input will replace the current content. The field is expected to remain focused. Actual Outcome: The tap action was performed on the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`), which contained \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\' and was focused. The goal was to select all text in the field. However, there is no visual indication that the text was selected, as the content \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\' remains unchanged. The action did not bring the agent closer to correcting the filename because the text was not cleared or prepared for replacement. The next action must focus on clearing or correctly setting the filename.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text in the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`). The field is currently focused and contains \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\'. This action will clear the field, making it ready for the correct filename input. The field is expected to remain focused and become empty. Actual Outcome: The `delete_all_text` action was performed on the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`), which contained \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\'. Instead of clearing the field to be empty, the action changed the content of the field to \\'my_note\\'. The field remains focused. This outcome was unexpected, as `delete_all_text` usually clears the field. However, it brings the field to a state (\\'my_note\\') where a previous action (inputting \\'X\\' in Step 26) successfully replaced the content. This means we can retry the strategy that worked from the \\'my_note\\' state. The action did not directly achieve the goal of an empty field, but it reset the field to a potentially more manageable state.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`, currently contains \\'my_note\\', and is focused. This action will test if the input field is responsive to text input. If successful, the text in the field will become \\'my_noteX\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field was successful. Instead of appending \\'X\\' to \\'my_note\\', the action replaced the entire content of the field with \\'X\\'. This is a highly beneficial outcome because it means the field is responsive to text input and the previous, undeletable text \\'my_note\\' has been effectively cleared. The agent is now significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the note. The next step is to input the actual desired filename.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"fair_ant_XOdi\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`, currently contains \\'X\\', and is focused. This action should replace \\'X\\' with \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'. If successful, the \\'Name\\' field will contain \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\' into the \\'Name\\' field, which contained \\'X\\', resulted in the text \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\'. The input was appended rather than replacing the existing content. Therefore, the filename is currently incorrect (\\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\' instead of \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'). The action brought the agent closer by inputting the characters of the filename, but a correction is needed. The text field remains focused.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"X\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the character \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`, currently contains \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\', and is focused. This action is intended to replace the current content \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\' with \\'X\\', based on the behavior observed in Step 26. If successful, the field will contain \\'X\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field, which previously contained \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\', resulted in the text \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\'. The input \\'X\\' was appended to the existing string, rather than replacing it as hoped. This outcome moves the agent further from the goal of setting the filename to \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'. The text field remains focused. A correction is necessary.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[381,346],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' input field, which currently contains \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\' and is focused. The tap coordinates are `[381, 346]`, which is the center of the input field based on the provided bounds `[369,84,392,607]`. This action is intended to select all text within the input field, so that the subsequent text input will replace the current content. The field is expected to remain focused. Actual Outcome: The tap action was performed on the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`), which contained \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\' and was focused. The goal was to select all text in the field. However, there is no visual indication that the text was selected, as the content \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\' remains unchanged. The action did not bring the agent closer to correcting the filename because the text was not cleared or prepared for replacement. The next action must focus on clearing or correctly setting the filename.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text in the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`). The field is currently focused and contains \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\'. This action will clear the field, making it ready for the correct filename input. The field is expected to remain focused and become empty. Actual Outcome: The `delete_all_text` action was performed on the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`), which contained \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\'. Instead of clearing the field to be empty, the action changed the content of the field to \\'my_note\\'. The field remains focused. This outcome was unexpected, as `delete_all_text` usually clears the field. However, it brings the field to a state (\\'my_note\\') where a previous action (inputting \\'X\\' in Step 26) successfully replaced the content. This means we can retry the strategy that worked from the \\'my_note\\' state. The action did not directly achieve the goal of an empty field, but it reset the field to a potentially more manageable state.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 31: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"X\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the character \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`, currently contains \\'my_note\\', and is focused. Based on previous behavior (Step 26), this action is expected to replace \\'my_note\\' with \\'X\\'. If successful, the \\'Name\\' field will contain \\'X\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`, currently contains \\'X\\', and is focused. This action should replace \\'X\\' with \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'. If successful, the \\'Name\\' field will contain \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\' into the \\'Name\\' field, which contained \\'X\\', resulted in the text \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\'. The input was appended rather than replacing the existing content. Therefore, the filename is currently incorrect (\\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\' instead of \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'). The action brought the agent closer by inputting the characters of the filename, but a correction is needed. The text field remains focused.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"X\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the character \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`, currently contains \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\', and is focused. This action is intended to replace the current content \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\' with \\'X\\', based on the behavior observed in Step 26. If successful, the field will contain \\'X\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field, which previously contained \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\', resulted in the text \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\'. The input \\'X\\' was appended to the existing string, rather than replacing it as hoped. This outcome moves the agent further from the goal of setting the filename to \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'. The text field remains focused. A correction is necessary.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[381,346],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' input field, which currently contains \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\' and is focused. The tap coordinates are `[381, 346]`, which is the center of the input field based on the provided bounds `[369,84,392,607]`. This action is intended to select all text within the input field, so that the subsequent text input will replace the current content. The field is expected to remain focused. Actual Outcome: The tap action was performed on the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`), which contained \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\' and was focused. The goal was to select all text in the field. However, there is no visual indication that the text was selected, as the content \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\' remains unchanged. The action did not bring the agent closer to correcting the filename because the text was not cleared or prepared for replacement. The next action must focus on clearing or correctly setting the filename.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text in the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`). The field is currently focused and contains \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\'. This action will clear the field, making it ready for the correct filename input. The field is expected to remain focused and become empty. Actual Outcome: The `delete_all_text` action was performed on the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`), which contained \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\'. Instead of clearing the field to be empty, the action changed the content of the field to \\'my_note\\'. The field remains focused. This outcome was unexpected, as `delete_all_text` usually clears the field. However, it brings the field to a state (\\'my_note\\') where a previous action (inputting \\'X\\' in Step 26) successfully replaced the content. This means we can retry the strategy that worked from the \\'my_note\\' state. The action did not directly achieve the goal of an empty field, but it reset the field to a potentially more manageable state.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"X\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the character \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`, currently contains \\'my_note\\', and is focused. Based on previous behavior (Step 26), this action is expected to replace \\'my_note\\' with \\'X\\'. If successful, the \\'Name\\' field will contain \\'X\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`), which previously contained \\'my_note\\', was successful. The content of the field was replaced with \\'X\\'. The field remains focused. This outcome aligns with the behavior observed in Step 26 and moves the agent closer to setting the correct filename. The next step is to input the main part of the desired filename, \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"X\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Share the entire content of the note with the phone number +13192815309 via SMS using Simple SMS Messenger\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"fair_ant_XOdi\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`, currently contains \\'X\\', and is focused. This action should replace \\'X\\' with \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'. If successful, the \\'Name\\' field will contain \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\' into the \\'Name\\' field, which contained \\'X\\', resulted in the text \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\'. The input was appended rather than replacing the existing content. Therefore, the filename is currently incorrect (\\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\' instead of \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'). The action brought the agent closer by inputting the characters of the filename, but a correction is needed. The text field remains focused.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"X\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the character \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`, currently contains \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\', and is focused. This action is intended to replace the current content \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\' with \\'X\\', based on the behavior observed in Step 26. If successful, the field will contain \\'X\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field, which previously contained \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\', resulted in the text \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\'. The input \\'X\\' was appended to the existing string, rather than replacing it as hoped. This outcome moves the agent further from the goal of setting the filename to \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'. The text field remains focused. A correction is necessary.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[381,346],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' input field, which currently contains \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\' and is focused. The tap coordinates are `[381, 346]`, which is the center of the input field based on the provided bounds `[369,84,392,607]`. This action is intended to select all text within the input field, so that the subsequent text input will replace the current content. The field is expected to remain focused. Actual Outcome: The tap action was performed on the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`), which contained \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\' and was focused. The goal was to select all text in the field. However, there is no visual indication that the text was selected, as the content \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\' remains unchanged. The action did not bring the agent closer to correcting the filename because the text was not cleared or prepared for replacement. The next action must focus on clearing or correctly setting the filename.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text in the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`). The field is currently focused and contains \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\'. This action will clear the field, making it ready for the correct filename input. The field is expected to remain focused and become empty. Actual Outcome: The `delete_all_text` action was performed on the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`), which contained \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\'. Instead of clearing the field to be empty, the action changed the content of the field to \\'my_note\\'. The field remains focused. This outcome was unexpected, as `delete_all_text` usually clears the field. However, it brings the field to a state (\\'my_note\\') where a previous action (inputting \\'X\\' in Step 26) successfully replaced the content. This means we can retry the strategy that worked from the \\'my_note\\' state. The action did not directly achieve the goal of an empty field, but it reset the field to a potentially more manageable state.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"X\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the character \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`, currently contains \\'my_note\\', and is focused. Based on previous behavior (Step 26), this action is expected to replace \\'my_note\\' with \\'X\\'. If successful, the \\'Name\\' field will contain \\'X\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`), which previously contained \\'my_note\\', was successful. The content of the field was replaced with \\'X\\'. The field remains focused. This outcome aligns with the behavior observed in Step 26 and moves the agent closer to setting the correct filename. The next step is to input the main part of the desired filename, \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 32: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"fair_ant_XOdi\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`, currently contains \\'X\\', and is focused. This action is intended to replace \\'X\\' with \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'. If successful, the \\'Name\\' field will contain \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'.

Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`, currently contains \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\', and is focused. This action is intended to replace the current content \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\' with \\'X\\', based on the behavior observed in Step 26. If successful, the field will contain \\'X\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field, which previously contained \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\', resulted in the text \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\'. The input \\'X\\' was appended to the existing string, rather than replacing it as hoped. This outcome moves the agent further from the goal of setting the filename to \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'. The text field remains focused. A correction is necessary.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[381,346],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' input field, which currently contains \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\' and is focused. The tap coordinates are `[381, 346]`, which is the center of the input field based on the provided bounds `[369,84,392,607]`. This action is intended to select all text within the input field, so that the subsequent text input will replace the current content. The field is expected to remain focused. Actual Outcome: The tap action was performed on the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`), which contained \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\' and was focused. The goal was to select all text in the field. However, there is no visual indication that the text was selected, as the content \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\' remains unchanged. The action did not bring the agent closer to correcting the filename because the text was not cleared or prepared for replacement. The next action must focus on clearing or correctly setting the filename.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text in the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`). The field is currently focused and contains \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\'. This action will clear the field, making it ready for the correct filename input. The field is expected to remain focused and become empty. Actual Outcome: The `delete_all_text` action was performed on the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`), which contained \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\'. Instead of clearing the field to be empty, the action changed the content of the field to \\'my_note\\'. The field remains focused. This outcome was unexpected, as `delete_all_text` usually clears the field. However, it brings the field to a state (\\'my_note\\') where a previous action (inputting \\'X\\' in Step 26) successfully replaced the content. This means we can retry the strategy that worked from the \\'my_note\\' state. The action did not directly achieve the goal of an empty field, but it reset the field to a potentially more manageable state.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"X\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the character \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`, currently contains \\'my_note\\', and is focused. Based on previous behavior (Step 26), this action is expected to replace \\'my_note\\' with \\'X\\'. If successful, the \\'Name\\' field will contain \\'X\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`), which previously contained \\'my_note\\', was successful. The content of the field was replaced with \\'X\\'. The field remains focused. This outcome aligns with the behavior observed in Step 26 and moves the agent closer to setting the correct filename. The next step is to input the main part of the desired filename, \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'.\\n Step 32: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"fair_ant_XOdi\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`, currently contains \\'X\\', and is focused. This action is intended to replace \\'X\\' with \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'. If successful, the \\'Name\\' field will contain \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\' into the \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`), which previously contained \\'X\\', resulted in the text \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\'. The input was appended to the existing content instead of replacing it. This means the filename is currently incorrect. The action partially moved towards the goal by adding the required characters, but a correction (deleting the leading \\'X\\') is now necessary. The text field remains focused.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"Xfair_ant_XOdi\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information.

Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field.

Share the entire content of the note with the phone number +13192815309 via SMS using Simple SMS Messenger\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"X\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the character \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`, currently contains \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\', and is focused. This action is intended to replace the current content \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\' with \\'X\\', based on the behavior observed in Step 26. If successful, the field will contain \\'X\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field, which previously contained \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\', resulted in the text \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\'. The input \\'X\\' was appended to the existing string, rather than replacing it as hoped. This outcome moves the agent further from the goal of setting the filename to \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'. The text field remains focused. A correction is necessary.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[381,346],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' input field, which currently contains \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\' and is focused. The tap coordinates are `[381, 346]`, which is the center of the input field based on the provided bounds `[369,84,392,607]`. This action is intended to select all text within the input field, so that the subsequent text input will replace the current content. The field is expected to remain focused. Actual Outcome: The tap action was performed on the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`), which contained \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\' and was focused. The goal was to select all text in the field. However, there is no visual indication that the text was selected, as the content \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\' remains unchanged. The action did not bring the agent closer to correcting the filename because the text was not cleared or prepared for replacement. The next action must focus on clearing or correctly setting the filename.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text in the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`). The field is currently focused and contains \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\'. This action will clear the field, making it ready for the correct filename input. The field is expected to remain focused and become empty. Actual Outcome: The `delete_all_text` action was performed on the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`), which contained \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\'. Instead of clearing the field to be empty, the action changed the content of the field to \\'my_note\\'. The field remains focused. This outcome was unexpected, as `delete_all_text` usually clears the field. However, it brings the field to a state (\\'my_note\\') where a previous action (inputting \\'X\\' in Step 26) successfully replaced the content. This means we can retry the strategy that worked from the \\'my_note\\' state. The action did not directly achieve the goal of an empty field, but it reset the field to a potentially more manageable state.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"X\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the character \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`, currently contains \\'my_note\\', and is focused. Based on previous behavior (Step 26), this action is expected to replace \\'my_note\\' with \\'X\\'. If successful, the \\'Name\\' field will contain \\'X\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`), which previously contained \\'my_note\\', was successful. The content of the field was replaced with \\'X\\'. The field remains focused. This outcome aligns with the behavior observed in Step 26 and moves the agent closer to setting the correct filename. The next step is to input the main part of the desired filename, \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'.\\n Step 32: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"fair_ant_XOdi\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`, currently contains \\'X\\', and is focused. This action is intended to replace \\'X\\' with \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'. If successful, the \\'Name\\' field will contain \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\' into the \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`), which previously contained \\'X\\', resulted in the text \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\'. The input was appended to the existing content instead of replacing it. This means the filename is currently incorrect. The action partially moved towards the goal by adding the required characters, but a correction (deleting the leading \\'X\\') is now necessary. The text field remains focused.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 33: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text in the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`). The field is currently focused and contains \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\'. This action is expected to either clear the field or reset it to \\'my_note\\'. If it resets to \\'my_note\\', the subsequent input of \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\' should replace it. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Markor App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Markor app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[381,346],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' input field, which currently contains \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\' and is focused. The tap coordinates are `[381, 346]`, which is the center of the input field based on the provided bounds `[369,84,392,607]`. This action is intended to select all text within the input field, so that the subsequent text input will replace the current content. The field is expected to remain focused. Actual Outcome: The tap action was performed on the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`), which contained \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\' and was focused. The goal was to select all text in the field. However, there is no visual indication that the text was selected, as the content \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\' remains unchanged. The action did not bring the agent closer to correcting the filename because the text was not cleared or prepared for replacement. The next action must focus on clearing or correctly setting the filename.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text in the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`). The field is currently focused and contains \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\'. This action will clear the field, making it ready for the correct filename input. The field is expected to remain focused and become empty. Actual Outcome: The `delete_all_text` action was performed on the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`), which contained \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\'. Instead of clearing the field to be empty, the action changed the content of the field to \\'my_note\\'. The field remains focused. This outcome was unexpected, as `delete_all_text` usually clears the field. However, it brings the field to a state (\\'my_note\\') where a previous action (inputting \\'X\\' in Step 26) successfully replaced the content. This means we can retry the strategy that worked from the \\'my_note\\' state. The action did not directly achieve the goal of an empty field, but it reset the field to a potentially more manageable state.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"X\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the character \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`, currently contains \\'my_note\\', and is focused. Based on previous behavior (Step 26), this action is expected to replace \\'my_note\\' with \\'X\\'. If successful, the \\'Name\\' field will contain \\'X\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`), which previously contained \\'my_note\\', was successful. The content of the field was replaced with \\'X\\'. The field remains focused. This outcome aligns with the behavior observed in Step 26 and moves the agent closer to setting the correct filename. The next step is to input the main part of the desired filename, \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'.\\n Step 32: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"fair_ant_XOdi\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`, currently contains \\'X\\', and is focused. This action is intended to replace \\'X\\' with \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'. If successful, the \\'Name\\' field will contain \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\' into the \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`), which previously contained \\'X\\', resulted in the text \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\'. The input was appended to the existing content instead of replacing it. This means the filename is currently incorrect. The action partially moved towards the goal by adding the required characters, but a correction (deleting the leading \\'X\\') is now necessary. The text field remains focused.\\n Step 33: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text in the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`). The field is currently focused and contains \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\'. This action is expected to either clear the field or reset it to \\'my_note\\'. If it resets to \\'my_note\\', the subsequent input of \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\' should replace it. Actual Outcome: The `delete_all_text` action was performed on the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`), which previously contained \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\'. Instead of clearing the field to be empty, the action changed the content of the field to \\'my_note\\'. The field remains focused. This outcome, while unexpected for a typical `delete_all_text` function, is consistent with previous behavior in this app (Step 30). It resets the field to a state (\\'my_note\\') where subsequent text input has been observed to replace the entire content (Step 31). Therefore, this action brings the agent closer to correctly setting the filename, as the next step will be to input \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\', which should replace \\'my_note\\'.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"my_note\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Share the entire content of the note with the phone number +13192815309 via SMS using Simple SMS Messenger\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[381,346],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Name\\' input field, which currently contains \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\' and is focused. The tap coordinates are `[381, 346]`, which is the center of the input field based on the provided bounds `[369,84,392,607]`. This action is intended to select all text within the input field, so that the subsequent text input will replace the current content. The field is expected to remain focused. Actual Outcome: The tap action was performed on the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`), which contained \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\' and was focused. The goal was to select all text in the field. However, there is no visual indication that the text was selected, as the content \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\' remains unchanged. The action did not bring the agent closer to correcting the filename because the text was not cleared or prepared for replacement. The next action must focus on clearing or correctly setting the filename.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text in the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`). The field is currently focused and contains \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\'. This action will clear the field, making it ready for the correct filename input. The field is expected to remain focused and become empty. Actual Outcome: The `delete_all_text` action was performed on the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`), which contained \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\'. Instead of clearing the field to be empty, the action changed the content of the field to \\'my_note\\'. The field remains focused. This outcome was unexpected, as `delete_all_text` usually clears the field. However, it brings the field to a state (\\'my_note\\') where a previous action (inputting \\'X\\' in Step 26) successfully replaced the content. This means we can retry the strategy that worked from the \\'my_note\\' state. The action did not directly achieve the goal of an empty field, but it reset the field to a potentially more manageable state.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"X\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the character \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`, currently contains \\'my_note\\', and is focused. Based on previous behavior (Step 26), this action is expected to replace \\'my_note\\' with \\'X\\'. If successful, the \\'Name\\' field will contain \\'X\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`), which previously contained \\'my_note\\', was successful. The content of the field was replaced with \\'X\\'. The field remains focused. This outcome aligns with the behavior observed in Step 26 and moves the agent closer to setting the correct filename. The next step is to input the main part of the desired filename, \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'.\\n Step 32: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"fair_ant_XOdi\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`, currently contains \\'X\\', and is focused. This action is intended to replace \\'X\\' with \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'. If successful, the \\'Name\\' field will contain \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\' into the \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`), which previously contained \\'X\\', resulted in the text \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\'. The input was appended to the existing content instead of replacing it. This means the filename is currently incorrect. The action partially moved towards the goal by adding the required characters, but a correction (deleting the leading \\'X\\') is now necessary. The text field remains focused.\\n Step 33: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text in the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`). The field is currently focused and contains \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\'. This action is expected to either clear the field or reset it to \\'my_note\\'. If it resets to \\'my_note\\', the subsequent input of \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\' should replace it. Actual Outcome: The `delete_all_text` action was performed on the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`), which previously contained \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\'. Instead of clearing the field to be empty, the action changed the content of the field to \\'my_note\\'. The field remains focused. This outcome, while unexpected for a typical `delete_all_text` function, is consistent with previous behavior in this app (Step 30). It resets the field to a state (\\'my_note\\') where subsequent text input has been observed to replace the entire content (Step 31).

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text in the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`). The field is currently focused and contains \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\'. This action will clear the field, making it ready for the correct filename input. The field is expected to remain focused and become empty. Actual Outcome: The `delete_all_text` action was performed on the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`), which contained \\'Xfair_ant_XOdiX\\'. Instead of clearing the field to be empty, the action changed the content of the field to \\'my_note\\'. The field remains focused. This outcome was unexpected, as `delete_all_text` usually clears the field. However, it brings the field to a state (\\'my_note\\') where a previous action (inputting \\'X\\' in Step 26) successfully replaced the content. This means we can retry the strategy that worked from the \\'my_note\\' state. The action did not directly achieve the goal of an empty field, but it reset the field to a potentially more manageable state.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"X\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the character \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`, currently contains \\'my_note\\', and is focused. Based on previous behavior (Step 26), this action is expected to replace \\'my_note\\' with \\'X\\'. If successful, the \\'Name\\' field will contain \\'X\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'X\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`), which previously contained \\'my_note\\', was successful. The content of the field was replaced with \\'X\\'. The field remains focused. This outcome aligns with the behavior observed in Step 26 and moves the agent closer to setting the correct filename. The next step is to input the main part of the desired filename, \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'.\\n Step 32: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"fair_ant_XOdi\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`, currently contains \\'X\\', and is focused. This action is intended to replace \\'X\\' with \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'. If successful, the \\'Name\\' field will contain \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\' into the \\'Name\\' field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`), which previously contained \\'X\\', resulted in the text \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\'. The input was appended to the existing content instead of replacing it. This means the filename is currently incorrect. The action partially moved towards the goal by adding the required characters, but a correction (deleting the leading \\'X\\') is now necessary. The text field remains focused.\\n Step 33: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text in the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`). The field is currently focused and contains \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\'. This action is expected to either clear the field or reset it to \\'my_note\\'. If it resets to \\'my_note\\', the subsequent input of \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\' should replace it. Actual Outcome: The `delete_all_text` action was performed on the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`), which previously contained \\'Xfair_ant_XOdi\\'. Instead of clearing the field to be empty, the action changed the content of the field to \\'my_note\\'. The field remains focused. This outcome, while unexpected for a typical `delete_all_text` function, is consistent with previous behavior in this app (Step 30). It resets the field to a state (\\'my_note\\') where subsequent text input has been observed to replace the entire content (Step 31). Therefore, this action brings the agent closer to correctly setting the filename, as the next step will be to input \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\', which should replace \\'my_note\\'.\\n Step 34: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"fair_ant_XOdi\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field. The field is `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`, currently contains \\'my_note\\', and is focused. This action is expected to replace \\'my_note\\' with \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'. If successful, the \\'Name\\' field will contain \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\' into the \\'Name\\' input field (resource-id `net.gsantner.markor:id/new_file_dialog__name`), which previously contained \\'my_note\\', was successful. The content of the field was replaced with \\'fair_ant_XOdi\\'. The field remains focused. This outcome aligns with the desired behavior and brings the agent significantly closer to completing the current subgoal of naming the note correctly.

The text you can edit is: \"fair_ant_XOdi\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",
