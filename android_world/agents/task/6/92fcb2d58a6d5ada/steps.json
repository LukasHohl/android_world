Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to open the \\'Gallery\\' app. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Gallery\\' app icon successfully launched the Simple Gallery Pro application. The app\\'s main screen is now displayed, showing a \\'Search folders\\' bar and a \\'DCIM\\' folder among other content. This action successfully completed the first subgoal and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.35\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [79, 171, 99, 461], \\'text\\': \\'Search folders\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [168, 7, 189, 307], \\'text\\': \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd_ Innovation and Excellence\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [199, 8, 209, 275], \\'text\\': \\'2023-01-24, Webcam, $38.40\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [299, 18, 315, 107], \\'text\\': \\'DCIM\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [330, 11, 344, 247], \\'text\\': \\'you for your purchase! Visit us at: WWW tech-gadgets com\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 640, 114, 723]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 194, 40, 242]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 753, 114, 839]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 853, 112, 945]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [140, 0, 351, 499]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [13, 819, 40, 893]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 47, 39, 188]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 900, 40, 947]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is taken to find and open the \\'Gallery\\' app as per the first subgoal. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'Gallery\\' app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[773,388],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Gallery\\' app icon to open the app. The \\'Gallery\\' app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. This action is expected to open the \\'Gallery\\' app. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Gallery\\' app icon successfully launched the Simple Gallery Pro application. The app\\'s main screen is now displayed, showing a \\'Search folders\\' bar and a \\'DCIM\\' folder among other content. This action successfully completed the first subgoal and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[245,249],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'DCIM\\' folder to open it. The \\'DCIM\\' folder is currently visible on the screen. This action is expected to open the \\'DCIM\\' folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'DCIM\\' folder successfully opened it. The screen now displays the contents of the DCIM folder, with a search bar specific to this folder (\\'Search in DCIM\\'). This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully navigating into the required folder. The next step is to locate the target image within this folder.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 3: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down the contents of the DCIM folder. This is done to reveal more files and hopefully find \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. The screen currently shows the top part of the DCIM folder\\'s content.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is taken to find and open the \\'Gallery\\' app as per the first subgoal. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'Gallery\\' app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[773,388],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Gallery\\' app icon to open the app. The \\'Gallery\\' app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. This action is expected to open the \\'Gallery\\' app. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Gallery\\' app icon successfully launched the Simple Gallery Pro application. The app\\'s main screen is now displayed, showing a \\'Search folders\\' bar and a \\'DCIM\\' folder among other content. This action successfully completed the first subgoal and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[245,249],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'DCIM\\' folder to open it. The \\'DCIM\\' folder is currently visible on the screen. This action is expected to open the \\'DCIM\\' folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'DCIM\\' folder successfully opened it. The screen now displays the contents of the DCIM folder, with a search bar specific to this folder (\\'Search in DCIM\\'). This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully navigating into the required folder. The next step is to locate the target image within this folder.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down the contents of the DCIM folder. This is done to reveal more files and hopefully find \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. The screen currently shows the top part of the DCIM folder\\'s content. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the contents of the DCIM folder upwards. While the screen content moved as expected, the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' is still not visible. The action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by revealing more of the folder\\'s content, but the image has not yet been found. Further scrolling or using the search function is necessary.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.36\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 396], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: -960.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 66, 503], \\'text\\': \\'[Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 66, 681], \\'text\\': \\'Yv:-0.960\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [84, 7, 97, 206], \\'text\\': \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd Innovation and Excellence\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [105, 7, 110, 184], \\'text\\': \\'2023-01-24, Webcam, 538.40\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [192, 7, 200, 163], \\'text\\': \\'Ihank you for your ourchasel Visir us aI: WvW.Tech-adqers-com\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [117, 0, 205, 335]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 141, 37, 188]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 38, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 904, 36, 945]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 821, 36, 862]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 865, 36, 900]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

However, this was not the desired outcome as the agent was supposed to be searching for an image within the DCIM folder. Instead, the action took the agent out of the DCIM folder and back to the main folder listing screen of the Gallery app. This moved the agent further away from completing the active subgoal. To get back on track, the agent needs to tap on the \\'DCIM\\' folder again.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.36\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 396], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: -960.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 681], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: -0.960\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [79, 171, 99, 461], \\'text\\': \\'Search folders\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [168, 7, 189, 307], \\'text\\': \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd_ Innovation and Excellence\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [199, 8, 209, 275], \\'text\\': \\'2023-01-24, Webcam, $38.40\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [299, 18, 315, 107], \\'text\\': \\'DCIM\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [330, 11, 344, 247], \\'text\\': \\'you for your purchase!

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is taken to find and open the \\'Gallery\\' app as per the first subgoal. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'Gallery\\' app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[773,388],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Gallery\\' app icon to open the app. The \\'Gallery\\' app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. This action is expected to open the \\'Gallery\\' app. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Gallery\\' app icon successfully launched the Simple Gallery Pro application. The app\\'s main screen is now displayed, showing a \\'Search folders\\' bar and a \\'DCIM\\' folder among other content. This action successfully completed the first subgoal and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[245,249],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'DCIM\\' folder to open it. The \\'DCIM\\' folder is currently visible on the screen. This action is expected to open the \\'DCIM\\' folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'DCIM\\' folder successfully opened it. The screen now displays the contents of the DCIM folder, with a search bar specific to this folder (\\'Search in DCIM\\'). This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully navigating into the required folder. The next step is to locate the target image within this folder.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down the contents of the DCIM folder. This is done to reveal more files and hopefully find \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. The screen currently shows the top part of the DCIM folder\\'s content. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the contents of the DCIM folder upwards. While the screen content moved as expected, the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' is still not visible. The action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by revealing more of the folder\\'s content, but the image has not yet been found. Further scrolling or using the search function is necessary.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button to exit the image viewer and return to the DCIM folder view. The screen currently shows an image. This action is predicted to navigate back to the list of files and folders within the DCIM directory. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully navigated to the previous screen. However, this was not the desired outcome as the agent was supposed to be searching for an image within the DCIM folder. Instead, the action took the agent out of the DCIM folder and back to the main folder listing screen of the Gallery app. This moved the agent further away from completing the active subgoal. To get back on track, the agent needs to tap on the \\'DCIM\\' folder again.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 5: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[773,388],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Gallery\\' app icon to open the app. The \\'Gallery\\' app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. This action is expected to open the \\'Gallery\\' app. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Gallery\\' app icon successfully launched the Simple Gallery Pro application. The app\\'s main screen is now displayed, showing a \\'Search folders\\' bar and a \\'DCIM\\' folder among other content. This action successfully completed the first subgoal and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[245,249],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'DCIM\\' folder to open it. The \\'DCIM\\' folder is currently visible on the screen. This action is expected to open the \\'DCIM\\' folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'DCIM\\' folder successfully opened it. The screen now displays the contents of the DCIM folder, with a search bar specific to this folder (\\'Search in DCIM\\'). This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully navigating into the required folder. The next step is to locate the target image within this folder.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down the contents of the DCIM folder. This is done to reveal more files and hopefully find \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. The screen currently shows the top part of the DCIM folder\\'s content. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the contents of the DCIM folder upwards. While the screen content moved as expected, the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' is still not visible. The action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by revealing more of the folder\\'s content, but the image has not yet been found. Further scrolling or using the search function is necessary.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button to exit the image viewer and return to the DCIM folder view. The screen currently shows an image. This action is predicted to navigate back to the list of files and folders within the DCIM directory. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully navigated to the previous screen. However, this was not the desired outcome as the agent was supposed to be searching for an image within the DCIM folder. Instead, the action took the agent out of the DCIM folder and back to the main folder listing screen of the Gallery app. This moved the agent further away from completing the active subgoal. To get back on track, the agent needs to tap on the \\'DCIM\\' folder again.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[252,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'DCIM\\' folder to open it. The \\'DCIM\\' folder is currently visible on the main screen of the Gallery app. This action is expected to open the \\'DCIM\\' folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'DCIM\\' folder successfully opened it. The screen now displays the contents of the DCIM folder, with a search bar specific to this folder (\\'Search in DCIM\\'). This action corrected the mistake from the previous step and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully navigating back into the required folder. The next step is to locate the target image within this folder.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.37\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [79, 171, 99, 477], \\'text\\': \\'Search in DCIM\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [154, 7, 167, 206], \\'text\\': \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd Innovation and Excellence\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [175, 7, 180, 184], \\'text\\': \\'2023-01-24, Webcam, 538.40\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [262, 7, 270, 165], \\'text\\': \\'Ihank you for your ourchasel Visir us al: WvW.Tech-adqers-com\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [123, 0, 275, 331]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 633, 114, 727]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 746, 110, 836]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 193, 39, 242]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 850, 111, 941]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [11, 819, 42, 943]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 40, 41, 196]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[773,388],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Gallery\\' app icon to open the app. The \\'Gallery\\' app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. This action is expected to open the \\'Gallery\\' app. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Gallery\\' app icon successfully launched the Simple Gallery Pro application. The app\\'s main screen is now displayed, showing a \\'Search folders\\' bar and a \\'DCIM\\' folder among other content. This action successfully completed the first subgoal and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[245,249],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'DCIM\\' folder to open it. The \\'DCIM\\' folder is currently visible on the screen. This action is expected to open the \\'DCIM\\' folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'DCIM\\' folder successfully opened it. The screen now displays the contents of the DCIM folder, with a search bar specific to this folder (\\'Search in DCIM\\'). This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully navigating into the required folder. The next step is to locate the target image within this folder.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down the contents of the DCIM folder. This is done to reveal more files and hopefully find \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. The screen currently shows the top part of the DCIM folder\\'s content. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the contents of the DCIM folder upwards. While the screen content moved as expected, the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' is still not visible. The action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by revealing more of the folder\\'s content, but the image has not yet been found. Further scrolling or using the search function is necessary.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button to exit the image viewer and return to the DCIM folder view. The screen currently shows an image. This action is predicted to navigate back to the list of files and folders within the DCIM directory. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully navigated to the previous screen. However, this was not the desired outcome as the agent was supposed to be searching for an image within the DCIM folder. Instead, the action took the agent out of the DCIM folder and back to the main folder listing screen of the Gallery app. This moved the agent further away from completing the active subgoal. To get back on track, the agent needs to tap on the \\'DCIM\\' folder again.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[252,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'DCIM\\' folder to open it. The \\'DCIM\\' folder is currently visible on the main screen of the Gallery app. This action is expected to open the \\'DCIM\\' folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'DCIM\\' folder successfully opened it. The screen now displays the contents of the DCIM folder, with a search bar specific to this folder (\\'Search in DCIM\\'). This action corrected the mistake from the previous step and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully navigating back into the required folder. The next step is to locate the target image within this folder.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 6: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down the contents of the DCIM folder. This is done to reveal more files and hopefully find \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. The screen currently shows the top part of the DCIM folder\\'s content.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[245,249],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'DCIM\\' folder to open it. The \\'DCIM\\' folder is currently visible on the screen. This action is expected to open the \\'DCIM\\' folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'DCIM\\' folder successfully opened it. The screen now displays the contents of the DCIM folder, with a search bar specific to this folder (\\'Search in DCIM\\'). This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully navigating into the required folder. The next step is to locate the target image within this folder.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down the contents of the DCIM folder. This is done to reveal more files and hopefully find \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. The screen currently shows the top part of the DCIM folder\\'s content. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the contents of the DCIM folder upwards. While the screen content moved as expected, the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' is still not visible. The action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by revealing more of the folder\\'s content, but the image has not yet been found. Further scrolling or using the search function is necessary.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button to exit the image viewer and return to the DCIM folder view. The screen currently shows an image. This action is predicted to navigate back to the list of files and folders within the DCIM directory. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully navigated to the previous screen. However, this was not the desired outcome as the agent was supposed to be searching for an image within the DCIM folder. Instead, the action took the agent out of the DCIM folder and back to the main folder listing screen of the Gallery app. This moved the agent further away from completing the active subgoal. To get back on track, the agent needs to tap on the \\'DCIM\\' folder again.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[252,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'DCIM\\' folder to open it. The \\'DCIM\\' folder is currently visible on the main screen of the Gallery app. This action is expected to open the \\'DCIM\\' folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'DCIM\\' folder successfully opened it. The screen now displays the contents of the DCIM folder, with a search bar specific to this folder (\\'Search in DCIM\\'). This action corrected the mistake from the previous step and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully navigating back into the required folder. The next step is to locate the target image within this folder.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down the contents of the DCIM folder. This is done to reveal more files and hopefully find \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. The screen currently shows the top part of the DCIM folder\\'s content. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the contents of the DCIM folder downwards. The screen content moved as expected, but the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' is still not visible. The \"Search in DCIM\" bar, which was previously visible at the top, is now scrolled off-screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by revealing more of the folder\\'s content, but the image has not yet been found. Since the image is not found after two scrolls, the next step is to use the search functionality. To do this, we first need to scroll back up to make the search bar visible.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.38\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 396], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: -960.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 66, 503], \\'text\\': \\'[Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 66, 681], \\'text\\': \\'Yv:-0.960\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [84, 7, 97, 206], \\'text\\': \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd Innovation and Excellence\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [105, 7, 110, 184], \\'text\\': \\'2023-01-24, Webcam, 538.40\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [192, 7, 200, 163], \\'text\\': \\'Ihank you for your ourchasel Visir us aI: WvW.Tech-adqers-com\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [117, 0, 205, 335]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 140, 37, 188]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 37, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 821, 36, 862]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 865, 37, 900]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 904, 36, 944]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[245,249],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'DCIM\\' folder to open it. The \\'DCIM\\' folder is currently visible on the screen. This action is expected to open the \\'DCIM\\' folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'DCIM\\' folder successfully opened it. The screen now displays the contents of the DCIM folder, with a search bar specific to this folder (\\'Search in DCIM\\'). This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully navigating into the required folder. The next step is to locate the target image within this folder.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down the contents of the DCIM folder. This is done to reveal more files and hopefully find \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. The screen currently shows the top part of the DCIM folder\\'s content. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the contents of the DCIM folder upwards. While the screen content moved as expected, the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' is still not visible. The action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by revealing more of the folder\\'s content, but the image has not yet been found. Further scrolling or using the search function is necessary.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button to exit the image viewer and return to the DCIM folder view. The screen currently shows an image. This action is predicted to navigate back to the list of files and folders within the DCIM directory. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully navigated to the previous screen. However, this was not the desired outcome as the agent was supposed to be searching for an image within the DCIM folder. Instead, the action took the agent out of the DCIM folder and back to the main folder listing screen of the Gallery app. This moved the agent further away from completing the active subgoal. To get back on track, the agent needs to tap on the \\'DCIM\\' folder again.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[252,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'DCIM\\' folder to open it. The \\'DCIM\\' folder is currently visible on the main screen of the Gallery app. This action is expected to open the \\'DCIM\\' folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'DCIM\\' folder successfully opened it. The screen now displays the contents of the DCIM folder, with a search bar specific to this folder (\\'Search in DCIM\\'). This action corrected the mistake from the previous step and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully navigating back into the required folder. The next step is to locate the target image within this folder.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down the contents of the DCIM folder. This is done to reveal more files and hopefully find \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. The screen currently shows the top part of the DCIM folder\\'s content. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the contents of the DCIM folder downwards. The screen content moved as expected, but the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' is still not visible. The \"Search in DCIM\" bar, which was previously visible at the top, is now scrolled off-screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by revealing more of the folder\\'s content, but the image has not yet been found. Since the image is not found after two scrolls, the next step is to use the search functionality. To do this, we first need to scroll back up to make the search bar visible.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 7: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[300,500],\"end_point\":[700,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down from [300, 500] to [700, 500] to scroll the content of the DCIM folder down. This is done to reveal the \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar, which was previously scrolled off-screen. The screen currently shows the lower part of the DCIM folder\\'s content. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open \\'Gallery\\' (Simple Gallery Pro) app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'Gallery\\' app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is done to reveal more files and hopefully find \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. The screen currently shows the top part of the DCIM folder\\'s content. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the contents of the DCIM folder upwards. While the screen content moved as expected, the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' is still not visible. The action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by revealing more of the folder\\'s content, but the image has not yet been found. Further scrolling or using the search function is necessary.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button to exit the image viewer and return to the DCIM folder view. The screen currently shows an image. This action is predicted to navigate back to the list of files and folders within the DCIM directory. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully navigated to the previous screen. However, this was not the desired outcome as the agent was supposed to be searching for an image within the DCIM folder. Instead, the action took the agent out of the DCIM folder and back to the main folder listing screen of the Gallery app. This moved the agent further away from completing the active subgoal. To get back on track, the agent needs to tap on the \\'DCIM\\' folder again.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[252,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'DCIM\\' folder to open it. The \\'DCIM\\' folder is currently visible on the main screen of the Gallery app. This action is expected to open the \\'DCIM\\' folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'DCIM\\' folder successfully opened it. The screen now displays the contents of the DCIM folder, with a search bar specific to this folder (\\'Search in DCIM\\'). This action corrected the mistake from the previous step and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully navigating back into the required folder. The next step is to locate the target image within this folder.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down the contents of the DCIM folder. This is done to reveal more files and hopefully find \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. The screen currently shows the top part of the DCIM folder\\'s content. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the contents of the DCIM folder downwards. The screen content moved as expected, but the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' is still not visible. The \"Search in DCIM\" bar, which was previously visible at the top, is now scrolled off-screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by revealing more of the folder\\'s content, but the image has not yet been found. Since the image is not found after two scrolls, the next step is to use the search functionality. To do this, we first need to scroll back up to make the search bar visible.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[300,500],\"end_point\":[700,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down from [300, 500] to [700, 500] to scroll the content of the DCIM folder down. This is done to reveal the \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar, which was previously scrolled off-screen. The screen currently shows the lower part of the DCIM folder\\'s content. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the contents of the DCIM folder downwards, revealing the \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar at the top of the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the search functionality accessible.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.38\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 392], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 960.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 674], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.960\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [79, 171, 99, 477], \\'text\\': \\'Search in DCIM\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [154, 7, 167, 206], \\'text\\': \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd Innovation and Excellence\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [175, 7, 180, 184], \\'text\\': \\'2023-01-24, Webcam, 538.40\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [262, 7, 270, 165], \\'text\\': \\'Ihank you for your ourchasel Visir us al: WvW.Tech-adqers-com\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [123, 1, 275, 331]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 634, 113, 726]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [70, 747, 110, 835]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 194, 39, 242]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 851, 111, 940]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [13, 821, 38, 899]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 903, 38, 946]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 43, 39, 188]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.39\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [76, 170, 102, 478], \\'text\\': \\'\u00dfearch in DCIM\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [154, 7, 167, 206], \\'text\\': \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd Innovation and Excellence\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [175, 7, 180, 184], \\'text\\': \\'2023-01-24, Webcam, 538.40\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [262, 7, 270, 165], \\'text\\': \\'Ihank you for your ourchasel Visir us al: WvW.Tech-adqers-com\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [124, 0, 275, 336]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 634, 114, 727]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 747, 110, 835]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 194, 40, 242]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 850, 112, 942]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [13, 820, 39, 896]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 903, 38, 947]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"1\", text=\"Search in DCIM\", resource-id=\"com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro:id/top_toolbar_search\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[147,149][626,275]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"Search in DCIM\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nIn Simple Gallery Pro, copy receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg in DCIM and save a copy with the same name in Download\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down the contents of the DCIM folder. This is done to reveal more files and hopefully find \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. The screen currently shows the top part of the DCIM folder\\'s content. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the contents of the DCIM folder upwards. While the screen content moved as expected, the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' is still not visible. The action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by revealing more of the folder\\'s content, but the image has not yet been found. Further scrolling or using the search function is necessary.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button to exit the image viewer and return to the DCIM folder view. The screen currently shows an image. This action is predicted to navigate back to the list of files and folders within the DCIM directory. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully navigated to the previous screen. However, this was not the desired outcome as the agent was supposed to be searching for an image within the DCIM folder. Instead, the action took the agent out of the DCIM folder and back to the main folder listing screen of the Gallery app. This moved the agent further away from completing the active subgoal. To get back on track, the agent needs to tap on the \\'DCIM\\' folder again.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[252,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'DCIM\\' folder to open it. The \\'DCIM\\' folder is currently visible on the main screen of the Gallery app. This action is expected to open the \\'DCIM\\' folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'DCIM\\' folder successfully opened it. The screen now displays the contents of the DCIM folder, with a search bar specific to this folder (\\'Search in DCIM\\'). This action corrected the mistake from the previous step and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully navigating back into the required folder. The next step is to locate the target image within this folder.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down the contents of the DCIM folder. This is done to reveal more files and hopefully find \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. The screen currently shows the top part of the DCIM folder\\'s content. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the contents of the DCIM folder downwards. The screen content moved as expected, but the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' is still not visible. The \"Search in DCIM\" bar, which was previously visible at the top, is now scrolled off-screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by revealing more of the folder\\'s content, but the image has not yet been found. Since the image is not found after two scrolls, the next step is to use the search functionality. To do this, we first need to scroll back up to make the search bar visible.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[300,500],\"end_point\":[700,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down from [300, 500] to [700, 500] to scroll the content of the DCIM folder down. This is done to reveal the \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar, which was previously scrolled off-screen. The screen currently shows the lower part of the DCIM folder\\'s content. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the contents of the DCIM folder downwards, revealing the \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar at the top of the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the search functionality accessible.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 8: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,324],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar. The search bar is currently visible at the top of the screen. This action is expected to activate the search bar, allowing text input for the filename. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open \\'Gallery\\' (Simple Gallery Pro) app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'Gallery\\' app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Instead, the action took the agent out of the DCIM folder and back to the main folder listing screen of the Gallery app. This moved the agent further away from completing the active subgoal. To get back on track, the agent needs to tap on the \\'DCIM\\' folder again.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[252,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'DCIM\\' folder to open it. The \\'DCIM\\' folder is currently visible on the main screen of the Gallery app. This action is expected to open the \\'DCIM\\' folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'DCIM\\' folder successfully opened it. The screen now displays the contents of the DCIM folder, with a search bar specific to this folder (\\'Search in DCIM\\'). This action corrected the mistake from the previous step and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully navigating back into the required folder. The next step is to locate the target image within this folder.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down the contents of the DCIM folder. This is done to reveal more files and hopefully find \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. The screen currently shows the top part of the DCIM folder\\'s content. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the contents of the DCIM folder downwards. The screen content moved as expected, but the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' is still not visible. The \"Search in DCIM\" bar, which was previously visible at the top, is now scrolled off-screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by revealing more of the folder\\'s content, but the image has not yet been found. Since the image is not found after two scrolls, the next step is to use the search functionality. To do this, we first need to scroll back up to make the search bar visible.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[300,500],\"end_point\":[700,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down from [300, 500] to [700, 500] to scroll the content of the DCIM folder down. This is done to reveal the \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar, which was previously scrolled off-screen. The screen currently shows the lower part of the DCIM folder\\'s content. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the contents of the DCIM folder downwards, revealing the \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar at the top of the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the search functionality accessible.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,324],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar. The search bar is currently visible at the top of the screen. This action is expected to activate the search bar, allowing text input for the filename. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar was successful. The search bar is now active, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, allowing for text input. The text field \\'Search in DCIM\\' is focused. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing for the search of the target image.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.39\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [76, 170, 102, 478], \\'text\\': \\'\u00dfearch in DCIM\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [154, 7, 167, 206], \\'text\\': \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd Innovation and Excellence\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [175, 7, 180, 184], \\'text\\': \\'2023-01-24, Webcam, 538.40\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [262, 7, 270, 165], \\'text\\': \\'Ihank you for your ourchasel Visir us al: WvW.Tech-adqers-com\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [124, 0, 275, 336]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 634, 114, 727]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 747, 110, 835]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 194, 40, 242]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 850, 112, 942]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [13, 820, 39, 896]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 903, 38, 947]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"1\", text=\"Search in DCIM\", resource-id=\"com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro:id/top_toolbar_search\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[147,149][626,275]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"Search in DCIM\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nIn Simple Gallery Pro, copy receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg in DCIM and save a copy with the same name in Download\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button to exit the image viewer and return to the DCIM folder view. The screen currently shows an image. This action is predicted to navigate back to the list of files and folders within the DCIM directory. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action successfully navigated to the previous screen. However, this was not the desired outcome as the agent was supposed to be searching for an image within the DCIM folder. Instead, the action took the agent out of the DCIM folder and back to the main folder listing screen of the Gallery app. This moved the agent further away from completing the active subgoal. To get back on track, the agent needs to tap on the \\'DCIM\\' folder again.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[252,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'DCIM\\' folder to open it. The \\'DCIM\\' folder is currently visible on the main screen of the Gallery app. This action is expected to open the \\'DCIM\\' folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'DCIM\\' folder successfully opened it. The screen now displays the contents of the DCIM folder, with a search bar specific to this folder (\\'Search in DCIM\\'). This action corrected the mistake from the previous step and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully navigating back into the required folder. The next step is to locate the target image within this folder.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down the contents of the DCIM folder. This is done to reveal more files and hopefully find \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. The screen currently shows the top part of the DCIM folder\\'s content. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the contents of the DCIM folder downwards. The screen content moved as expected, but the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' is still not visible. The \"Search in DCIM\" bar, which was previously visible at the top, is now scrolled off-screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by revealing more of the folder\\'s content, but the image has not yet been found. Since the image is not found after two scrolls, the next step is to use the search functionality. To do this, we first need to scroll back up to make the search bar visible.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[300,500],\"end_point\":[700,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down from [300, 500] to [700, 500] to scroll the content of the DCIM folder down. This is done to reveal the \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar, which was previously scrolled off-screen. The screen currently shows the lower part of the DCIM folder\\'s content. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the contents of the DCIM folder downwards, revealing the \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar at the top of the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the search functionality accessible.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,324],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar. The search bar is currently visible at the top of the screen. This action is expected to activate the search bar, allowing text input for the filename. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar was successful. The search bar is now active, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, allowing for text input. The text field \\'Search in DCIM\\' is focused. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing for the search of the target image.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 9: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\\' into the focused \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field. The text field currently contains \\'Search in DCIM\\'. This action will replace the placeholder text with the filename and then, due to the \\'\\\\n\\', initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the gallery will display search results for the entered filename. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open \\'Gallery\\' (Simple Gallery Pro) app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'Gallery\\' app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[252,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'DCIM\\' folder to open it. The \\'DCIM\\' folder is currently visible on the main screen of the Gallery app. This action is expected to open the \\'DCIM\\' folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'DCIM\\' folder successfully opened it. The screen now displays the contents of the DCIM folder, with a search bar specific to this folder (\\'Search in DCIM\\'). This action corrected the mistake from the previous step and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully navigating back into the required folder. The next step is to locate the target image within this folder.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down the contents of the DCIM folder. This is done to reveal more files and hopefully find \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. The screen currently shows the top part of the DCIM folder\\'s content. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the contents of the DCIM folder downwards. The screen content moved as expected, but the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' is still not visible. The \"Search in DCIM\" bar, which was previously visible at the top, is now scrolled off-screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by revealing more of the folder\\'s content, but the image has not yet been found. Since the image is not found after two scrolls, the next step is to use the search functionality. To do this, we first need to scroll back up to make the search bar visible.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[300,500],\"end_point\":[700,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down from [300, 500] to [700, 500] to scroll the content of the DCIM folder down. This is done to reveal the \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar, which was previously scrolled off-screen. The screen currently shows the lower part of the DCIM folder\\'s content. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the contents of the DCIM folder downwards, revealing the \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar at the top of the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the search functionality accessible.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,324],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar. The search bar is currently visible at the top of the screen. This action is expected to activate the search bar, allowing text input for the filename. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar was successful. The search bar is now active, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, allowing for text input. The text field \\'Search in DCIM\\' is focused. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing for the search of the target image.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\\' into the focused \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field. The text field currently contains \\'Search in DCIM\\'. This action will replace the placeholder text with the filename and then, due to the \\'\\\\n\\', initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the gallery will display search results for the entered filename. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\\' into the search bar resulted in the text field (com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro:id/top_toolbar_search) being updated with \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' according to the XML data. Visually, the search bar shows a truncated/altered version (\\'201_22_sure_frog jpg\\'). The screen content below the search bar did not change to display the target image. The action successfully entered the search term, but the image is not yet located. An explicit \\'Enter\\' key press is needed to ensure the search is executed.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.39\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [74, 169, 105, 588], \\'text\\': \\'201_22_sure_frog jpg\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [154, 7, 167, 206], \\'text\\': \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd Innovation and Excellence\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [175, 7, 180, 184], \\'text\\': \\'2023-01-24, Webcam, 538.40\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [262, 7, 270, 165], \\'text\\': \\'Ihank you for your ourchasel Visir us al: WvW.Tech-adqers-com\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [124, 0, 275, 336]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 634, 115, 724]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 749, 114, 835]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 194, 39, 241]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 821, 38, 903]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 843, 115, 951]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"1\", text=\"receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\", resource-id=\"com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro:id/top_toolbar_search\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[147,149][626,275]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nIn Simple Gallery Pro, copy receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg in DCIM and save a copy with the same name in Download\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[252,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'DCIM\\' folder to open it. The \\'DCIM\\' folder is currently visible on the main screen of the Gallery app. This action is expected to open the \\'DCIM\\' folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'DCIM\\' folder successfully opened it. The screen now displays the contents of the DCIM folder, with a search bar specific to this folder (\\'Search in DCIM\\'). This action corrected the mistake from the previous step and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully navigating back into the required folder. The next step is to locate the target image within this folder.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down the contents of the DCIM folder. This is done to reveal more files and hopefully find \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. The screen currently shows the top part of the DCIM folder\\'s content. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the contents of the DCIM folder downwards. The screen content moved as expected, but the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' is still not visible. The \"Search in DCIM\" bar, which was previously visible at the top, is now scrolled off-screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by revealing more of the folder\\'s content, but the image has not yet been found. Since the image is not found after two scrolls, the next step is to use the search functionality. To do this, we first need to scroll back up to make the search bar visible.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[300,500],\"end_point\":[700,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down from [300, 500] to [700, 500] to scroll the content of the DCIM folder down. This is done to reveal the \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar, which was previously scrolled off-screen. The screen currently shows the lower part of the DCIM folder\\'s content. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the contents of the DCIM folder downwards, revealing the \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar at the top of the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the search functionality accessible.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,324],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar. The search bar is currently visible at the top of the screen. This action is expected to activate the search bar, allowing text input for the filename. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar was successful. The search bar is now active, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, allowing for text input. The text field \\'Search in DCIM\\' is focused. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing for the search of the target image.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\\' into the focused \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field. The text field currently contains \\'Search in DCIM\\'. This action will replace the placeholder text with the filename and then, due to the \\'\\\\n\\', initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the gallery will display search results for the entered filename. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\\' into the search bar resulted in the text field (com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro:id/top_toolbar_search) being updated with \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' according to the XML data. Visually, the search bar shows a truncated/altered version (\\'201_22_sure_frog jpg\\'). The screen content below the search bar did not change to display the target image. The action successfully entered the search term, but the image is not yet located. An explicit \\'Enter\\' key press is needed to ensure the search is executed.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 10: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send KEYCODE_ENTER (66) to execute the search. The search bar currently contains \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' (though visually truncated). This action is expected to trigger the search and display the results, hopefully showing the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open \\'Gallery\\' (Simple Gallery Pro) app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'Gallery\\' app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is done to reveal more files and hopefully find \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. The screen currently shows the top part of the DCIM folder\\'s content. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the contents of the DCIM folder downwards. The screen content moved as expected, but the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' is still not visible. The \"Search in DCIM\" bar, which was previously visible at the top, is now scrolled off-screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by revealing more of the folder\\'s content, but the image has not yet been found. Since the image is not found after two scrolls, the next step is to use the search functionality. To do this, we first need to scroll back up to make the search bar visible.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[300,500],\"end_point\":[700,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down from [300, 500] to [700, 500] to scroll the content of the DCIM folder down. This is done to reveal the \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar, which was previously scrolled off-screen. The screen currently shows the lower part of the DCIM folder\\'s content. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the contents of the DCIM folder downwards, revealing the \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar at the top of the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the search functionality accessible.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,324],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar. The search bar is currently visible at the top of the screen. This action is expected to activate the search bar, allowing text input for the filename. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar was successful. The search bar is now active, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, allowing for text input. The text field \\'Search in DCIM\\' is focused. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing for the search of the target image.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\\' into the focused \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field. The text field currently contains \\'Search in DCIM\\'. This action will replace the placeholder text with the filename and then, due to the \\'\\\\n\\', initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the gallery will display search results for the entered filename. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\\' into the search bar resulted in the text field (com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro:id/top_toolbar_search) being updated with \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' according to the XML data. Visually, the search bar shows a truncated/altered version (\\'201_22_sure_frog jpg\\'). The screen content below the search bar did not change to display the target image. The action successfully entered the search term, but the image is not yet located. An explicit \\'Enter\\' key press is needed to ensure the search is executed.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send KEYCODE_ENTER (66) to execute the search. The search bar currently contains \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' (though visually truncated). This action is expected to trigger the search and display the results, hopefully showing the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of sending KEYCODE_ENTER (66) did not result in any visible change on the screen. The screen was already displaying the search result from the previous text input action, which was the image \\'_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\', not the target \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The search for the full filename was unsuccessful in locating the correct image. A new search strategy is required.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.40\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [74, 169, 105, 588], \\'text\\': \\'201_22_sure_frog jpg\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [154, 7, 167, 206], \\'text\\': \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd Innovation and Excellence\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [175, 7, 180, 184], \\'text\\': \\'2023-01-24, Webcam, 538.40\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [262, 7, 270, 165], \\'text\\': \\'Ihank you for your ourchasel Visir us al: WvW.Tech-adqers-com\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [124, 0, 275, 336]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 634, 115, 724]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 748, 114, 835]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 194, 39, 241]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 821, 38, 903]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 843, 115, 951]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"1\", text=\"receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\", resource-id=\"com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro:id/top_toolbar_search\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[147,149][626,275]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is done to reveal more files and hopefully find \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. The screen currently shows the top part of the DCIM folder\\'s content. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the contents of the DCIM folder downwards. The screen content moved as expected, but the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' is still not visible. The \"Search in DCIM\" bar, which was previously visible at the top, is now scrolled off-screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by revealing more of the folder\\'s content, but the image has not yet been found. Since the image is not found after two scrolls, the next step is to use the search functionality. To do this, we first need to scroll back up to make the search bar visible.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[300,500],\"end_point\":[700,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down from [300, 500] to [700, 500] to scroll the content of the DCIM folder down. This is done to reveal the \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar, which was previously scrolled off-screen. The screen currently shows the lower part of the DCIM folder\\'s content. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the contents of the DCIM folder downwards, revealing the \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar at the top of the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the search functionality accessible.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,324],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar. The search bar is currently visible at the top of the screen. This action is expected to activate the search bar, allowing text input for the filename. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar was successful. The search bar is now active, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, allowing for text input. The text field \\'Search in DCIM\\' is focused. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing for the search of the target image.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\\' into the focused \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field. The text field currently contains \\'Search in DCIM\\'. This action will replace the placeholder text with the filename and then, due to the \\'\\\\n\\', initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the gallery will display search results for the entered filename. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\\' into the search bar resulted in the text field (com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro:id/top_toolbar_search) being updated with \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' according to the XML data. Visually, the search bar shows a truncated/altered version (\\'201_22_sure_frog jpg\\'). The screen content below the search bar did not change to display the target image. The action successfully entered the search term, but the image is not yet located. An explicit \\'Enter\\' key press is needed to ensure the search is executed.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send KEYCODE_ENTER (66) to execute the search. The search bar currently contains \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' (though visually truncated). This action is expected to trigger the search and display the results, hopefully showing the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of sending KEYCODE_ENTER (66) did not result in any visible change on the screen. The screen was already displaying the search result from the previous text input action, which was the image \\'_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\', not the target \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The search for the full filename was unsuccessful in locating the correct image. A new search strategy is required.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 11: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the focused search bar (`com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro:id/top_toolbar_search`). The search bar currently contains \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. This action will clear the search bar to prepare for a new search term. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will be empty. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open \\'Gallery\\' (Simple Gallery Pro) app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'Gallery\\' app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is done to reveal the \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar, which was previously scrolled off-screen. The screen currently shows the lower part of the DCIM folder\\'s content. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the contents of the DCIM folder downwards, revealing the \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar at the top of the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the search functionality accessible.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,324],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar. The search bar is currently visible at the top of the screen. This action is expected to activate the search bar, allowing text input for the filename. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar was successful. The search bar is now active, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, allowing for text input. The text field \\'Search in DCIM\\' is focused. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing for the search of the target image.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\\' into the focused \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field. The text field currently contains \\'Search in DCIM\\'. This action will replace the placeholder text with the filename and then, due to the \\'\\\\n\\', initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the gallery will display search results for the entered filename. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\\' into the search bar resulted in the text field (com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro:id/top_toolbar_search) being updated with \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' according to the XML data. Visually, the search bar shows a truncated/altered version (\\'201_22_sure_frog jpg\\'). The screen content below the search bar did not change to display the target image. The action successfully entered the search term, but the image is not yet located. An explicit \\'Enter\\' key press is needed to ensure the search is executed.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send KEYCODE_ENTER (66) to execute the search. The search bar currently contains \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' (though visually truncated). This action is expected to trigger the search and display the results, hopefully showing the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of sending KEYCODE_ENTER (66) did not result in any visible change on the screen. The screen was already displaying the search result from the previous text input action, which was the image \\'_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\', not the target \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The search for the full filename was unsuccessful in locating the correct image. A new search strategy is required.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the focused search bar (`com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro:id/top_toolbar_search`). The search bar currently contains \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. This action will clear the search bar to prepare for a new search term. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will be empty. Actual Outcome: The action of deleting all text in the focused text field was successful. The search bar, which previously contained \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' (visually truncated to \\'_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'), is now empty and displays the placeholder text \\'Search in DCIM\\'. The virtual keyboard remains visible. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by clearing the search field for a new search attempt.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.42\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [76, 170, 102, 478], \\'text\\': \\'\u00dfearch in DCIM\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [154, 7, 167, 206], \\'text\\': \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd Innovation and Excellence\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [175, 7, 180, 184], \\'text\\': \\'2023-01-24, Webcam, 538.40\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [262, 7, 270, 165], \\'text\\': \\'Ihank you for your ourchasel Visir us al: WvW.Tech-adqers-com\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [124, 0, 275, 336]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 634, 114, 727]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 747, 110, 835]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 194, 39, 242]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 820, 39, 896]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 850, 112, 942]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 903, 38, 947]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 114, 115, 632]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"1\", text=\"Search in DCIM\", resource-id=\"com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro:id/top_toolbar_search\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[147,149][626,275]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"Search in DCIM\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"receipt\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nIn Simple Gallery Pro, copy receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg in DCIM and save a copy with the same name in Download\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[300,500],\"end_point\":[700,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down from [300, 500] to [700, 500] to scroll the content of the DCIM folder down. This is done to reveal the \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar, which was previously scrolled off-screen. The screen currently shows the lower part of the DCIM folder\\'s content. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the contents of the DCIM folder downwards, revealing the \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar at the top of the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the search functionality accessible.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,324],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar. The search bar is currently visible at the top of the screen. This action is expected to activate the search bar, allowing text input for the filename. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar was successful. The search bar is now active, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, allowing for text input. The text field \\'Search in DCIM\\' is focused. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing for the search of the target image.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\\' into the focused \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field. The text field currently contains \\'Search in DCIM\\'. This action will replace the placeholder text with the filename and then, due to the \\'\\\\n\\', initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the gallery will display search results for the entered filename. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\\' into the search bar resulted in the text field (com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro:id/top_toolbar_search) being updated with \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' according to the XML data. Visually, the search bar shows a truncated/altered version (\\'201_22_sure_frog jpg\\'). The screen content below the search bar did not change to display the target image. The action successfully entered the search term, but the image is not yet located. An explicit \\'Enter\\' key press is needed to ensure the search is executed.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send KEYCODE_ENTER (66) to execute the search. The search bar currently contains \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' (though visually truncated). This action is expected to trigger the search and display the results, hopefully showing the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of sending KEYCODE_ENTER (66) did not result in any visible change on the screen. The screen was already displaying the search result from the previous text input action, which was the image \\'_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\', not the target \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The search for the full filename was unsuccessful in locating the correct image. A new search strategy is required.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the focused search bar (`com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro:id/top_toolbar_search`). The search bar currently contains \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. This action will clear the search bar to prepare for a new search term. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will be empty. Actual Outcome: The action of deleting all text in the focused text field was successful. The search bar, which previously contained \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' (visually truncated to \\'_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'), is now empty and displays the placeholder text \\'Search in DCIM\\'. The virtual keyboard remains visible. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by clearing the search field for a new search attempt.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 12: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"receipt\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'receipt\\' into the focused \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field. The text field currently contains \\'Search in DCIM\\' (placeholder). This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'receipt\\'. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will contain \\'receipt\\', and the gallery will prepare to display search results for this term. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open \\'Gallery\\' (Simple Gallery Pro) app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'Gallery\\' app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar was successful. The search bar is now active, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, allowing for text input. The text field \\'Search in DCIM\\' is focused. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing for the search of the target image.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\\' into the focused \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field. The text field currently contains \\'Search in DCIM\\'. This action will replace the placeholder text with the filename and then, due to the \\'\\\\n\\', initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the gallery will display search results for the entered filename. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\\' into the search bar resulted in the text field (com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro:id/top_toolbar_search) being updated with \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' according to the XML data. Visually, the search bar shows a truncated/altered version (\\'201_22_sure_frog jpg\\'). The screen content below the search bar did not change to display the target image. The action successfully entered the search term, but the image is not yet located. An explicit \\'Enter\\' key press is needed to ensure the search is executed.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send KEYCODE_ENTER (66) to execute the search. The search bar currently contains \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' (though visually truncated). This action is expected to trigger the search and display the results, hopefully showing the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of sending KEYCODE_ENTER (66) did not result in any visible change on the screen. The screen was already displaying the search result from the previous text input action, which was the image \\'_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\', not the target \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The search for the full filename was unsuccessful in locating the correct image. A new search strategy is required.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the focused search bar (`com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro:id/top_toolbar_search`). The search bar currently contains \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. This action will clear the search bar to prepare for a new search term. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will be empty. Actual Outcome: The action of deleting all text in the focused text field was successful. The search bar, which previously contained \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' (visually truncated to \\'_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'), is now empty and displays the placeholder text \\'Search in DCIM\\'. The virtual keyboard remains visible. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by clearing the search field for a new search attempt.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"receipt\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'receipt\\' into the focused \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field. The text field currently contains \\'Search in DCIM\\' (placeholder). This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'receipt\\'. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will contain \\'receipt\\', and the gallery will prepare to display search results for this term. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'receipt\\' into the focused text field was successful. The search bar (com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro:id/top_toolbar_search) now contains the text \\'receipt\\', replacing the previous placeholder text. The virtual keyboard remains visible. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing a new search query.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.42\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [78, 170, 104, 317], \\'text\\': \\'receipt\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [154, 7, 167, 206], \\'text\\': \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd Innovation and Excellence\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [175, 7, 180, 184], \\'text\\': \\'2023-01-24, Webcam, 538.40\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [262, 7, 270, 165], \\'text\\': \\'Ihank you for your ourchasel Visir us al: WvW.Tech-adqers-com\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [123, 0, 275, 331]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 748, 110, 834]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 636, 115, 725]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 194, 38, 241]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [13, 820, 39, 896]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 847, 113, 946]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 904, 37, 947]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"1\", text=\"receipt\", resource-id=\"com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro:id/top_toolbar_search\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[147,149][626,275]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"receipt\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"receipt\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nIn Simple Gallery Pro, copy receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg in DCIM and save a copy with the same name in Download\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,324],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar. The search bar is currently visible at the top of the screen. This action is expected to activate the search bar, allowing text input for the filename. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar was successful. The search bar is now active, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, allowing for text input. The text field \\'Search in DCIM\\' is focused. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing for the search of the target image.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\\' into the focused \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field. The text field currently contains \\'Search in DCIM\\'. This action will replace the placeholder text with the filename and then, due to the \\'\\\\n\\', initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the gallery will display search results for the entered filename. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\\' into the search bar resulted in the text field (com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro:id/top_toolbar_search) being updated with \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' according to the XML data. Visually, the search bar shows a truncated/altered version (\\'201_22_sure_frog jpg\\'). The screen content below the search bar did not change to display the target image. The action successfully entered the search term, but the image is not yet located. An explicit \\'Enter\\' key press is needed to ensure the search is executed.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send KEYCODE_ENTER (66) to execute the search. The search bar currently contains \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' (though visually truncated). This action is expected to trigger the search and display the results, hopefully showing the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of sending KEYCODE_ENTER (66) did not result in any visible change on the screen. The screen was already displaying the search result from the previous text input action, which was the image \\'_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\', not the target \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The search for the full filename was unsuccessful in locating the correct image. A new search strategy is required.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the focused search bar (`com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro:id/top_toolbar_search`). The search bar currently contains \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. This action will clear the search bar to prepare for a new search term. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will be empty. Actual Outcome: The action of deleting all text in the focused text field was successful. The search bar, which previously contained \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' (visually truncated to \\'_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'), is now empty and displays the placeholder text \\'Search in DCIM\\'. The virtual keyboard remains visible. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by clearing the search field for a new search attempt.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"receipt\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'receipt\\' into the focused \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field. The text field currently contains \\'Search in DCIM\\' (placeholder). This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'receipt\\'. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will contain \\'receipt\\', and the gallery will prepare to display search results for this term. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'receipt\\' into the focused text field was successful. The search bar (com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro:id/top_toolbar_search) now contains the text \\'receipt\\', replacing the previous placeholder text. The virtual keyboard remains visible. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing a new search query.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 13: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send KEYCODE_ENTER (66) to execute the search. The search bar currently contains \\'receipt\\'. This action is expected to trigger the search and display the results for images containing \\'receipt\\' in their name or metadata. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open \\'Gallery\\' (Simple Gallery Pro) app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'Gallery\\' app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text field currently contains \\'Search in DCIM\\'. This action will replace the placeholder text with the filename and then, due to the \\'\\\\n\\', initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the gallery will display search results for the entered filename. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\\' into the search bar resulted in the text field (com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro:id/top_toolbar_search) being updated with \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' according to the XML data. Visually, the search bar shows a truncated/altered version (\\'201_22_sure_frog jpg\\'). The screen content below the search bar did not change to display the target image. The action successfully entered the search term, but the image is not yet located. An explicit \\'Enter\\' key press is needed to ensure the search is executed.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send KEYCODE_ENTER (66) to execute the search. The search bar currently contains \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' (though visually truncated). This action is expected to trigger the search and display the results, hopefully showing the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of sending KEYCODE_ENTER (66) did not result in any visible change on the screen. The screen was already displaying the search result from the previous text input action, which was the image \\'_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\', not the target \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The search for the full filename was unsuccessful in locating the correct image. A new search strategy is required.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the focused search bar (`com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro:id/top_toolbar_search`). The search bar currently contains \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. This action will clear the search bar to prepare for a new search term. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will be empty. Actual Outcome: The action of deleting all text in the focused text field was successful. The search bar, which previously contained \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' (visually truncated to \\'_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'), is now empty and displays the placeholder text \\'Search in DCIM\\'. The virtual keyboard remains visible. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by clearing the search field for a new search attempt.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"receipt\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'receipt\\' into the focused \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field. The text field currently contains \\'Search in DCIM\\' (placeholder). This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'receipt\\'. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will contain \\'receipt\\', and the gallery will prepare to display search results for this term. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'receipt\\' into the focused text field was successful. The search bar (com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro:id/top_toolbar_search) now contains the text \\'receipt\\', replacing the previous placeholder text. The virtual keyboard remains visible. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing a new search query.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send KEYCODE_ENTER (66) to execute the search. The search bar currently contains \\'receipt\\'. This action is expected to trigger the search and display the results for images containing \\'receipt\\' in their name or metadata. Actual Outcome: The action of sending KEYCODE_ENTER (66) to execute the search for \\'receipt\\' did not result in any visible change on the screen. The search bar still contains \\'receipt\\', and the displayed image (\\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\', dated \\'2023-01-24\\') is not the target image. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' was not found. The search was unsuccessful.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.42\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [78, 170, 104, 317], \\'text\\': \\'receipt\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [154, 7, 167, 206], \\'text\\': \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd Innovation and Excellence\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [175, 7, 180, 184], \\'text\\': \\'2023-01-24, Webcam, 538.40\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [262, 7, 270, 165], \\'text\\': \\'Ihank you for your ourchasel Visir us al: WvW.Tech-adqers-com\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [123, 0, 275, 331]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 748, 111, 834]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 637, 115, 724]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 194, 38, 241]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 847, 113, 945]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 821, 38, 894]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 904, 38, 947]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"1\", text=\"receipt\", resource-id=\"com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro:id/top_toolbar_search\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[147,149][626,275]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"receipt\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text field currently contains \\'Search in DCIM\\'. This action will replace the placeholder text with the filename and then, due to the \\'\\\\n\\', initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the gallery will display search results for the entered filename. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\\' into the search bar resulted in the text field (com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro:id/top_toolbar_search) being updated with \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' according to the XML data. Visually, the search bar shows a truncated/altered version (\\'201_22_sure_frog jpg\\'). The screen content below the search bar did not change to display the target image. The action successfully entered the search term, but the image is not yet located. An explicit \\'Enter\\' key press is needed to ensure the search is executed.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send KEYCODE_ENTER (66) to execute the search. The search bar currently contains \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' (though visually truncated). This action is expected to trigger the search and display the results, hopefully showing the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of sending KEYCODE_ENTER (66) did not result in any visible change on the screen. The screen was already displaying the search result from the previous text input action, which was the image \\'_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\', not the target \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The search for the full filename was unsuccessful in locating the correct image. A new search strategy is required.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the focused search bar (`com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro:id/top_toolbar_search`). The search bar currently contains \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. This action will clear the search bar to prepare for a new search term. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will be empty. Actual Outcome: The action of deleting all text in the focused text field was successful. The search bar, which previously contained \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' (visually truncated to \\'_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'), is now empty and displays the placeholder text \\'Search in DCIM\\'. The virtual keyboard remains visible. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by clearing the search field for a new search attempt.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"receipt\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'receipt\\' into the focused \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field. The text field currently contains \\'Search in DCIM\\' (placeholder). This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'receipt\\'. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will contain \\'receipt\\', and the gallery will prepare to display search results for this term. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'receipt\\' into the focused text field was successful. The search bar (com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro:id/top_toolbar_search) now contains the text \\'receipt\\', replacing the previous placeholder text. The virtual keyboard remains visible. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing a new search query.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send KEYCODE_ENTER (66) to execute the search. The search bar currently contains \\'receipt\\'. This action is expected to trigger the search and display the results for images containing \\'receipt\\' in their name or metadata. Actual Outcome: The action of sending KEYCODE_ENTER (66) to execute the search for \\'receipt\\' did not result in any visible change on the screen. The search bar still contains \\'receipt\\', and the displayed image (\\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\', dated \\'2023-01-24\\') is not the target image. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' was not found. The search was unsuccessful.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 14: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,109],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, located to the left of the \\'receipt\\' text in the search bar. The search bar currently displays \\'receipt\\'. This action is intended to exit the search results view and return to the previous view, which should be the DCIM folder content, allowing for manual browsing of files. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open \\'Gallery\\' (Simple Gallery Pro) app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'Gallery\\' app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The search bar currently contains \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' (though visually truncated). This action is expected to trigger the search and display the results, hopefully showing the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of sending KEYCODE_ENTER (66) did not result in any visible change on the screen. The screen was already displaying the search result from the previous text input action, which was the image \\'_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\', not the target \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The search for the full filename was unsuccessful in locating the correct image. A new search strategy is required.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the focused search bar (`com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro:id/top_toolbar_search`). The search bar currently contains \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. This action will clear the search bar to prepare for a new search term. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will be empty. Actual Outcome: The action of deleting all text in the focused text field was successful. The search bar, which previously contained \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' (visually truncated to \\'_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'), is now empty and displays the placeholder text \\'Search in DCIM\\'. The virtual keyboard remains visible. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by clearing the search field for a new search attempt.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"receipt\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'receipt\\' into the focused \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field. The text field currently contains \\'Search in DCIM\\' (placeholder). This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'receipt\\'. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will contain \\'receipt\\', and the gallery will prepare to display search results for this term. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'receipt\\' into the focused text field was successful. The search bar (com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro:id/top_toolbar_search) now contains the text \\'receipt\\', replacing the previous placeholder text. The virtual keyboard remains visible. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing a new search query.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send KEYCODE_ENTER (66) to execute the search. The search bar currently contains \\'receipt\\'. This action is expected to trigger the search and display the results for images containing \\'receipt\\' in their name or metadata. Actual Outcome: The action of sending KEYCODE_ENTER (66) to execute the search for \\'receipt\\' did not result in any visible change on the screen. The search bar still contains \\'receipt\\', and the displayed image (\\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\', dated \\'2023-01-24\\') is not the target image. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' was not found. The search was unsuccessful.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,109],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, located to the left of the \\'receipt\\' text in the search bar. The search bar currently displays \\'receipt\\'. This action is intended to exit the search results view and return to the previous view, which should be the DCIM folder content, allowing for manual browsing of files. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon (which was to the left of the \\'receipt\\' text in the search bar) was successful. It cleared the text \\'receipt\\' from the search bar, which now displays the placeholder \\'Search in DCIM\\'. The virtual keyboard was also closed. The agent is now in an empty search interface within the DCIM folder. This action brought the agent closer to the subgoal by preparing to exit the search mode, but it did not yet return to the DCIM folder\\'s file listing. To return to the DCIM folder view, another tap on the back arrow (now to the left of \\'Search in DCIM\\') is needed.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.43\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [79, 171, 99, 477], \\'text\\': \\'Search in DCIM\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [154, 7, 167, 206], \\'text\\': \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd Innovation and Excellence\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [175, 7, 180, 184], \\'text\\': \\'2023-01-24, Webcam, 538.40\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [262, 7, 270, 165], \\'text\\': \\'Ihank you for your ourchasel Visir us al: WvW.Tech-adqers-com\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [124, 0, 275, 336]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 633, 114, 726]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 747, 110, 836]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 193, 39, 242]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 848, 111, 948]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [11, 819, 42, 945]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 40, 41, 195]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Actual Outcome: The action of sending KEYCODE_ENTER (66) did not result in any visible change on the screen. The screen was already displaying the search result from the previous text input action, which was the image \\'_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\', not the target \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The search for the full filename was unsuccessful in locating the correct image. A new search strategy is required.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the focused search bar (`com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro:id/top_toolbar_search`). The search bar currently contains \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. This action will clear the search bar to prepare for a new search term. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will be empty. Actual Outcome: The action of deleting all text in the focused text field was successful. The search bar, which previously contained \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' (visually truncated to \\'_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'), is now empty and displays the placeholder text \\'Search in DCIM\\'. The virtual keyboard remains visible. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by clearing the search field for a new search attempt.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"receipt\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'receipt\\' into the focused \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field. The text field currently contains \\'Search in DCIM\\' (placeholder). This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'receipt\\'. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will contain \\'receipt\\', and the gallery will prepare to display search results for this term. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'receipt\\' into the focused text field was successful. The search bar (com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro:id/top_toolbar_search) now contains the text \\'receipt\\', replacing the previous placeholder text. The virtual keyboard remains visible. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing a new search query.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send KEYCODE_ENTER (66) to execute the search. The search bar currently contains \\'receipt\\'. This action is expected to trigger the search and display the results for images containing \\'receipt\\' in their name or metadata. Actual Outcome: The action of sending KEYCODE_ENTER (66) to execute the search for \\'receipt\\' did not result in any visible change on the screen. The search bar still contains \\'receipt\\', and the displayed image (\\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\', dated \\'2023-01-24\\') is not the target image. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' was not found. The search was unsuccessful.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,109],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, located to the left of the \\'receipt\\' text in the search bar. The search bar currently displays \\'receipt\\'. This action is intended to exit the search results view and return to the previous view, which should be the DCIM folder content, allowing for manual browsing of files. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon (which was to the left of the \\'receipt\\' text in the search bar) was successful. It cleared the text \\'receipt\\' from the search bar, which now displays the placeholder \\'Search in DCIM\\'. The virtual keyboard was also closed. The agent is now in an empty search interface within the DCIM folder. This action brought the agent closer to the subgoal by preparing to exit the search mode, but it did not yet return to the DCIM folder\\'s file listing. To return to the DCIM folder view, another tap on the back arrow (now to the left of \\'Search in DCIM\\') is needed.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 15: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,109],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, located to the left of \\'Search in DCIM\\'. The current view is an empty search interface within the DCIM folder. This action is intended to exit the search interface and return to the DCIM folder view, displaying its contents. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open \\'Gallery\\' (Simple Gallery Pro) app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'Gallery\\' app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The search bar currently contains \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. This action will clear the search bar to prepare for a new search term. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will be empty. Actual Outcome: The action of deleting all text in the focused text field was successful. The search bar, which previously contained \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' (visually truncated to \\'_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'), is now empty and displays the placeholder text \\'Search in DCIM\\'. The virtual keyboard remains visible. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by clearing the search field for a new search attempt.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"receipt\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'receipt\\' into the focused \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field. The text field currently contains \\'Search in DCIM\\' (placeholder). This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'receipt\\'. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will contain \\'receipt\\', and the gallery will prepare to display search results for this term. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'receipt\\' into the focused text field was successful. The search bar (com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro:id/top_toolbar_search) now contains the text \\'receipt\\', replacing the previous placeholder text. The virtual keyboard remains visible. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing a new search query.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send KEYCODE_ENTER (66) to execute the search. The search bar currently contains \\'receipt\\'. This action is expected to trigger the search and display the results for images containing \\'receipt\\' in their name or metadata. Actual Outcome: The action of sending KEYCODE_ENTER (66) to execute the search for \\'receipt\\' did not result in any visible change on the screen. The search bar still contains \\'receipt\\', and the displayed image (\\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\', dated \\'2023-01-24\\') is not the target image. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' was not found. The search was unsuccessful.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,109],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, located to the left of the \\'receipt\\' text in the search bar. The search bar currently displays \\'receipt\\'. This action is intended to exit the search results view and return to the previous view, which should be the DCIM folder content, allowing for manual browsing of files. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon (which was to the left of the \\'receipt\\' text in the search bar) was successful. It cleared the text \\'receipt\\' from the search bar, which now displays the placeholder \\'Search in DCIM\\'. The virtual keyboard was also closed. The agent is now in an empty search interface within the DCIM folder. This action brought the agent closer to the subgoal by preparing to exit the search mode, but it did not yet return to the DCIM folder\\'s file listing. To return to the DCIM folder view, another tap on the back arrow (now to the left of \\'Search in DCIM\\') is needed.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,109],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, located to the left of \\'Search in DCIM\\'. The current view is an empty search interface within the DCIM folder. This action is intended to exit the search interface and return to the DCIM folder view, displaying its contents. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon (when \\'Search in DCIM\\' was displayed) successfully exited the search mode. However, instead of returning to the DCIM folder\\'s content view, it returned to a higher-level view where folders are listed, including \\'DCIM\\'. The search bar now displays \\'Search folders\\'. The DCIM folder is visible as an item on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to the subgoal by exiting the failed search, but an additional step is needed to re-enter the DCIM folder to browse its contents.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.44\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [79, 171, 99, 461], \\'text\\': \\'Search folders\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [168, 7, 189, 307], \\'text\\': \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd_ Innovation and Excellence\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [199, 8, 209, 275], \\'text\\': \\'2023-01-24, Webcam, $38.40\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [299, 18, 315, 107], \\'text\\': \\'DCIM\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [330, 11, 344, 247], \\'text\\': \\'you for your purchase! Visit us at: WWW tech-gadgets com\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 640, 114, 723]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 194, 39, 242]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 753, 114, 839]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 853, 112, 946]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [142, 0, 351, 500]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [13, 819, 39, 895]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 44, 40, 188]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 902, 38, 947]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the focused search bar (`com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro:id/top_toolbar_search`). The search bar currently contains \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. This action will clear the search bar to prepare for a new search term. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will be empty. Actual Outcome: The action of deleting all text in the focused text field was successful. The search bar, which previously contained \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' (visually truncated to \\'_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'), is now empty and displays the placeholder text \\'Search in DCIM\\'. The virtual keyboard remains visible. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by clearing the search field for a new search attempt.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"receipt\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'receipt\\' into the focused \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field. The text field currently contains \\'Search in DCIM\\' (placeholder). This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'receipt\\'. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will contain \\'receipt\\', and the gallery will prepare to display search results for this term. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'receipt\\' into the focused text field was successful. The search bar (com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro:id/top_toolbar_search) now contains the text \\'receipt\\', replacing the previous placeholder text. The virtual keyboard remains visible. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing a new search query.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send KEYCODE_ENTER (66) to execute the search. The search bar currently contains \\'receipt\\'. This action is expected to trigger the search and display the results for images containing \\'receipt\\' in their name or metadata. Actual Outcome: The action of sending KEYCODE_ENTER (66) to execute the search for \\'receipt\\' did not result in any visible change on the screen. The search bar still contains \\'receipt\\', and the displayed image (\\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\', dated \\'2023-01-24\\') is not the target image. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' was not found. The search was unsuccessful.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,109],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, located to the left of the \\'receipt\\' text in the search bar. The search bar currently displays \\'receipt\\'. This action is intended to exit the search results view and return to the previous view, which should be the DCIM folder content, allowing for manual browsing of files. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon (which was to the left of the \\'receipt\\' text in the search bar) was successful. It cleared the text \\'receipt\\' from the search bar, which now displays the placeholder \\'Search in DCIM\\'. The virtual keyboard was also closed. The agent is now in an empty search interface within the DCIM folder. This action brought the agent closer to the subgoal by preparing to exit the search mode, but it did not yet return to the DCIM folder\\'s file listing. To return to the DCIM folder view, another tap on the back arrow (now to the left of \\'Search in DCIM\\') is needed.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,109],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, located to the left of \\'Search in DCIM\\'. The current view is an empty search interface within the DCIM folder. This action is intended to exit the search interface and return to the DCIM folder view, displaying its contents. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon (when \\'Search in DCIM\\' was displayed) successfully exited the search mode. However, instead of returning to the DCIM folder\\'s content view, it returned to a higher-level view where folders are listed, including \\'DCIM\\'. The search bar now displays \\'Search folders\\'. The DCIM folder is visible as an item on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to the subgoal by exiting the failed search, but an additional step is needed to re-enter the DCIM folder to browse its contents.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 16: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

The predicted outcome is that the screen will show the files and subfolders within the DCIM directory.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text field currently contains \\'Search in DCIM\\' (placeholder). This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'receipt\\'. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will contain \\'receipt\\', and the gallery will prepare to display search results for this term. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'receipt\\' into the focused text field was successful. The search bar (com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro:id/top_toolbar_search) now contains the text \\'receipt\\', replacing the previous placeholder text. The virtual keyboard remains visible. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing a new search query.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send KEYCODE_ENTER (66) to execute the search. The search bar currently contains \\'receipt\\'. This action is expected to trigger the search and display the results for images containing \\'receipt\\' in their name or metadata. Actual Outcome: The action of sending KEYCODE_ENTER (66) to execute the search for \\'receipt\\' did not result in any visible change on the screen. The search bar still contains \\'receipt\\', and the displayed image (\\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\', dated \\'2023-01-24\\') is not the target image. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' was not found. The search was unsuccessful.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,109],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, located to the left of the \\'receipt\\' text in the search bar. The search bar currently displays \\'receipt\\'. This action is intended to exit the search results view and return to the previous view, which should be the DCIM folder content, allowing for manual browsing of files. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon (which was to the left of the \\'receipt\\' text in the search bar) was successful. It cleared the text \\'receipt\\' from the search bar, which now displays the placeholder \\'Search in DCIM\\'. The virtual keyboard was also closed. The agent is now in an empty search interface within the DCIM folder. This action brought the agent closer to the subgoal by preparing to exit the search mode, but it did not yet return to the DCIM folder\\'s file listing. To return to the DCIM folder view, another tap on the back arrow (now to the left of \\'Search in DCIM\\') is needed.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,109],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, located to the left of \\'Search in DCIM\\'. The current view is an empty search interface within the DCIM folder. This action is intended to exit the search interface and return to the DCIM folder view, displaying its contents. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon (when \\'Search in DCIM\\' was displayed) successfully exited the search mode. However, instead of returning to the DCIM folder\\'s content view, it returned to a higher-level view where folders are listed, including \\'DCIM\\'. The search bar now displays \\'Search folders\\'. The DCIM folder is visible as an item on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to the subgoal by exiting the failed search, but an additional step is needed to re-enter the DCIM folder to browse its contents.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[307,62],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'DCIM\\' folder. The \\'DCIM\\' folder is currently visible in a list of folders. This action will open the DCIM folder, displaying its contents. The predicted outcome is that the screen will show the files and subfolders within the DCIM directory. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'DCIM\\' folder was successful. The Gallery app navigated into the DCIM folder. The screen now displays the contents of the DCIM folder, and the search bar at the top reads \\'Search in DCIM\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by opening the correct folder. The next step is to find the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' within this folder, likely by scrolling.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.45\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [79, 171, 99, 477], \\'text\\': \\'Search in DCIM\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [154, 7, 167, 206], \\'text\\': \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd Innovation and Excellence\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [175, 7, 180, 184], \\'text\\': \\'2023-01-24, Webcam, 538.40\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [262, 7, 270, 165], \\'text\\': \\'Ihank you for your ourchasel Visir us al: WvW.Tech-adqers-com\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [123, 1, 275, 331]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 634, 114, 726]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 747, 110, 836]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 849, 112, 948]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 193, 39, 242]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [10, 818, 43, 895]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 40, 41, 195]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text field currently contains \\'Search in DCIM\\' (placeholder). This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'receipt\\'. The predicted outcome is that the search bar will contain \\'receipt\\', and the gallery will prepare to display search results for this term. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'receipt\\' into the focused text field was successful. The search bar (com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro:id/top_toolbar_search) now contains the text \\'receipt\\', replacing the previous placeholder text. The virtual keyboard remains visible. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing a new search query.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send KEYCODE_ENTER (66) to execute the search. The search bar currently contains \\'receipt\\'. This action is expected to trigger the search and display the results for images containing \\'receipt\\' in their name or metadata. Actual Outcome: The action of sending KEYCODE_ENTER (66) to execute the search for \\'receipt\\' did not result in any visible change on the screen. The search bar still contains \\'receipt\\', and the displayed image (\\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\', dated \\'2023-01-24\\') is not the target image. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' was not found. The search was unsuccessful.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,109],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, located to the left of the \\'receipt\\' text in the search bar. The search bar currently displays \\'receipt\\'. This action is intended to exit the search results view and return to the previous view, which should be the DCIM folder content, allowing for manual browsing of files. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon (which was to the left of the \\'receipt\\' text in the search bar) was successful. It cleared the text \\'receipt\\' from the search bar, which now displays the placeholder \\'Search in DCIM\\'. The virtual keyboard was also closed. The agent is now in an empty search interface within the DCIM folder. This action brought the agent closer to the subgoal by preparing to exit the search mode, but it did not yet return to the DCIM folder\\'s file listing. To return to the DCIM folder view, another tap on the back arrow (now to the left of \\'Search in DCIM\\') is needed.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,109],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, located to the left of \\'Search in DCIM\\'. The current view is an empty search interface within the DCIM folder. This action is intended to exit the search interface and return to the DCIM folder view, displaying its contents. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon (when \\'Search in DCIM\\' was displayed) successfully exited the search mode. However, instead of returning to the DCIM folder\\'s content view, it returned to a higher-level view where folders are listed, including \\'DCIM\\'. The search bar now displays \\'Search folders\\'. The DCIM folder is visible as an item on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to the subgoal by exiting the failed search, but an additional step is needed to re-enter the DCIM folder to browse its contents.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[307,62],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'DCIM\\' folder. The \\'DCIM\\' folder is currently visible in a list of folders. This action will open the DCIM folder, displaying its contents. The predicted outcome is that the screen will show the files and subfolders within the DCIM directory. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'DCIM\\' folder was successful. The Gallery app navigated into the DCIM folder. The screen now displays the contents of the DCIM folder, and the search bar at the top reads \\'Search in DCIM\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by opening the correct folder. The next step is to find the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' within this folder, likely by scrolling.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 17: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen to scroll down through the contents of the DCIM folder. The current view shows an image \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\' at the top of the list. This action is intended to reveal more files located below the currently visible area, hopefully including the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The search bar currently contains \\'receipt\\'. This action is expected to trigger the search and display the results for images containing \\'receipt\\' in their name or metadata. Actual Outcome: The action of sending KEYCODE_ENTER (66) to execute the search for \\'receipt\\' did not result in any visible change on the screen. The search bar still contains \\'receipt\\', and the displayed image (\\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\', dated \\'2023-01-24\\') is not the target image. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' was not found. The search was unsuccessful.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,109],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, located to the left of the \\'receipt\\' text in the search bar. The search bar currently displays \\'receipt\\'. This action is intended to exit the search results view and return to the previous view, which should be the DCIM folder content, allowing for manual browsing of files. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon (which was to the left of the \\'receipt\\' text in the search bar) was successful. It cleared the text \\'receipt\\' from the search bar, which now displays the placeholder \\'Search in DCIM\\'. The virtual keyboard was also closed. The agent is now in an empty search interface within the DCIM folder. This action brought the agent closer to the subgoal by preparing to exit the search mode, but it did not yet return to the DCIM folder\\'s file listing. To return to the DCIM folder view, another tap on the back arrow (now to the left of \\'Search in DCIM\\') is needed.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,109],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, located to the left of \\'Search in DCIM\\'. The current view is an empty search interface within the DCIM folder. This action is intended to exit the search interface and return to the DCIM folder view, displaying its contents. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon (when \\'Search in DCIM\\' was displayed) successfully exited the search mode. However, instead of returning to the DCIM folder\\'s content view, it returned to a higher-level view where folders are listed, including \\'DCIM\\'. The search bar now displays \\'Search folders\\'. The DCIM folder is visible as an item on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to the subgoal by exiting the failed search, but an additional step is needed to re-enter the DCIM folder to browse its contents.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[307,62],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'DCIM\\' folder. The \\'DCIM\\' folder is currently visible in a list of folders. This action will open the DCIM folder, displaying its contents. The predicted outcome is that the screen will show the files and subfolders within the DCIM directory. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'DCIM\\' folder was successful. The Gallery app navigated into the DCIM folder. The screen now displays the contents of the DCIM folder, and the search bar at the top reads \\'Search in DCIM\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by opening the correct folder. The next step is to find the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' within this folder, likely by scrolling.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen to scroll down through the contents of the DCIM folder. The current view shows an image \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\' at the top of the list. This action is intended to reveal more files located below the currently visible area, hopefully including the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the content of the DCIM folder. New items are now visible on the screen, but the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' has not yet been found. The action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by revealing more content, but further scrolling is needed.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The search bar currently contains \\'receipt\\'. This action is expected to trigger the search and display the results for images containing \\'receipt\\' in their name or metadata. Actual Outcome: The action of sending KEYCODE_ENTER (66) to execute the search for \\'receipt\\' did not result in any visible change on the screen. The search bar still contains \\'receipt\\', and the displayed image (\\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\', dated \\'2023-01-24\\') is not the target image. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' was not found. The search was unsuccessful.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,109],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, located to the left of the \\'receipt\\' text in the search bar. The search bar currently displays \\'receipt\\'. This action is intended to exit the search results view and return to the previous view, which should be the DCIM folder content, allowing for manual browsing of files. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon (which was to the left of the \\'receipt\\' text in the search bar) was successful. It cleared the text \\'receipt\\' from the search bar, which now displays the placeholder \\'Search in DCIM\\'. The virtual keyboard was also closed. The agent is now in an empty search interface within the DCIM folder. This action brought the agent closer to the subgoal by preparing to exit the search mode, but it did not yet return to the DCIM folder\\'s file listing. To return to the DCIM folder view, another tap on the back arrow (now to the left of \\'Search in DCIM\\') is needed.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,109],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, located to the left of \\'Search in DCIM\\'. The current view is an empty search interface within the DCIM folder. This action is intended to exit the search interface and return to the DCIM folder view, displaying its contents. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon (when \\'Search in DCIM\\' was displayed) successfully exited the search mode. However, instead of returning to the DCIM folder\\'s content view, it returned to a higher-level view where folders are listed, including \\'DCIM\\'. The search bar now displays \\'Search folders\\'. The DCIM folder is visible as an item on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to the subgoal by exiting the failed search, but an additional step is needed to re-enter the DCIM folder to browse its contents.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[307,62],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'DCIM\\' folder. The \\'DCIM\\' folder is currently visible in a list of folders. This action will open the DCIM folder, displaying its contents. The predicted outcome is that the screen will show the files and subfolders within the DCIM directory. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'DCIM\\' folder was successful. The Gallery app navigated into the DCIM folder. The screen now displays the contents of the DCIM folder, and the search bar at the top reads \\'Search in DCIM\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by opening the correct folder. The next step is to find the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' within this folder, likely by scrolling.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen to scroll down through the contents of the DCIM folder.

This action is intended to reveal more files located below the currently visible area, hopefully including the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the content of the DCIM folder. New items are now visible on the screen, but the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' has not yet been found.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,109],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, located to the left of the \\'receipt\\' text in the search bar. The search bar currently displays \\'receipt\\'. This action is intended to exit the search results view and return to the previous view, which should be the DCIM folder content, allowing for manual browsing of files. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon (which was to the left of the \\'receipt\\' text in the search bar) was successful. It cleared the text \\'receipt\\' from the search bar, which now displays the placeholder \\'Search in DCIM\\'. The virtual keyboard was also closed. The agent is now in an empty search interface within the DCIM folder. This action brought the agent closer to the subgoal by preparing to exit the search mode, but it did not yet return to the DCIM folder\\'s file listing. To return to the DCIM folder view, another tap on the back arrow (now to the left of \\'Search in DCIM\\') is needed.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,109],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, located to the left of \\'Search in DCIM\\'. The current view is an empty search interface within the DCIM folder. This action is intended to exit the search interface and return to the DCIM folder view, displaying its contents. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon (when \\'Search in DCIM\\' was displayed) successfully exited the search mode. However, instead of returning to the DCIM folder\\'s content view, it returned to a higher-level view where folders are listed, including \\'DCIM\\'. The search bar now displays \\'Search folders\\'. The DCIM folder is visible as an item on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to the subgoal by exiting the failed search, but an additional step is needed to re-enter the DCIM folder to browse its contents.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[307,62],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'DCIM\\' folder. The \\'DCIM\\' folder is currently visible in a list of folders. This action will open the DCIM folder, displaying its contents. The predicted outcome is that the screen will show the files and subfolders within the DCIM directory. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'DCIM\\' folder was successful. The Gallery app navigated into the DCIM folder. The screen now displays the contents of the DCIM folder, and the search bar at the top reads \\'Search in DCIM\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by opening the correct folder. The next step is to find the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' within this folder, likely by scrolling.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen to scroll down through the contents of the DCIM folder. The current view shows an image \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\' at the top of the list. This action is intended to reveal more files located below the currently visible area, hopefully including the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the content of the DCIM folder. New items are now visible on the screen, but the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' has not yet been found. The action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by revealing more content, but further scrolling is needed.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen to scroll down through the contents of the DCIM folder. The current view shows an image \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\' at the top of the list. This action is intended to reveal more files located below the currently visible area, hopefully including the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe up action (intended to scroll down) did not result in any visible change on the screen. The same image (\\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\') remained visible. This suggests that the end of the scrollable content in the downward direction has been reached. The action did not bring the agent closer to finding the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.46\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 396], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: -960.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 66, 503], \\'text\\': \\'[Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 66, 681], \\'text\\': \\'Yv:-0.960\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [84, 7, 97, 206], \\'text\\': \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd Innovation and Excellence\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [105, 7, 110, 184], \\'text\\': \\'2023-01-24, Webcam, 538.40\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [192, 7, 200, 163], \\'text\\': \\'Ihank you for your ourchasel Visir us aI: WvW.Tech-adqers-com\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [117, 0, 205, 335]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 141, 37, 188]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 38, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 821, 36, 862]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 865, 37, 900]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 904, 36, 944]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,109],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, located to the left of the \\'receipt\\' text in the search bar. The search bar currently displays \\'receipt\\'. This action is intended to exit the search results view and return to the previous view, which should be the DCIM folder content, allowing for manual browsing of files. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon (which was to the left of the \\'receipt\\' text in the search bar) was successful. It cleared the text \\'receipt\\' from the search bar, which now displays the placeholder \\'Search in DCIM\\'. The virtual keyboard was also closed. The agent is now in an empty search interface within the DCIM folder. This action brought the agent closer to the subgoal by preparing to exit the search mode, but it did not yet return to the DCIM folder\\'s file listing. To return to the DCIM folder view, another tap on the back arrow (now to the left of \\'Search in DCIM\\') is needed.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,109],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, located to the left of \\'Search in DCIM\\'. The current view is an empty search interface within the DCIM folder. This action is intended to exit the search interface and return to the DCIM folder view, displaying its contents. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon (when \\'Search in DCIM\\' was displayed) successfully exited the search mode. However, instead of returning to the DCIM folder\\'s content view, it returned to a higher-level view where folders are listed, including \\'DCIM\\'. The search bar now displays \\'Search folders\\'. The DCIM folder is visible as an item on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to the subgoal by exiting the failed search, but an additional step is needed to re-enter the DCIM folder to browse its contents.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[307,62],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'DCIM\\' folder. The \\'DCIM\\' folder is currently visible in a list of folders. This action will open the DCIM folder, displaying its contents. The predicted outcome is that the screen will show the files and subfolders within the DCIM directory. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'DCIM\\' folder was successful. The Gallery app navigated into the DCIM folder. The screen now displays the contents of the DCIM folder, and the search bar at the top reads \\'Search in DCIM\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by opening the correct folder. The next step is to find the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' within this folder, likely by scrolling.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen to scroll down through the contents of the DCIM folder. The current view shows an image \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\' at the top of the list. This action is intended to reveal more files located below the currently visible area, hopefully including the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the content of the DCIM folder. New items are now visible on the screen, but the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' has not yet been found. The action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by revealing more content, but further scrolling is needed.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen to scroll down through the contents of the DCIM folder. The current view shows an image \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\' at the top of the list. This action is intended to reveal more files located below the currently visible area, hopefully including the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe up action (intended to scroll down) did not result in any visible change on the screen. The same image (\\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\') remained visible. This suggests that the end of the scrollable content in the downward direction has been reached. The action did not bring the agent closer to finding the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 19: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[300,500],\"end_point\":[700,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down on the screen (from [300,500] to [700,500]) to scroll up and check if the image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' was missed or is located above the currently visible items. The current view shows an image \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\' at the top of the list. This action is intended to reveal files located above the currently visible area.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,109],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, located to the left of \\'Search in DCIM\\'. The current view is an empty search interface within the DCIM folder. This action is intended to exit the search interface and return to the DCIM folder view, displaying its contents. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon (when \\'Search in DCIM\\' was displayed) successfully exited the search mode. However, instead of returning to the DCIM folder\\'s content view, it returned to a higher-level view where folders are listed, including \\'DCIM\\'. The search bar now displays \\'Search folders\\'. The DCIM folder is visible as an item on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to the subgoal by exiting the failed search, but an additional step is needed to re-enter the DCIM folder to browse its contents.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[307,62],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'DCIM\\' folder. The \\'DCIM\\' folder is currently visible in a list of folders. This action will open the DCIM folder, displaying its contents. The predicted outcome is that the screen will show the files and subfolders within the DCIM directory. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'DCIM\\' folder was successful. The Gallery app navigated into the DCIM folder. The screen now displays the contents of the DCIM folder, and the search bar at the top reads \\'Search in DCIM\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by opening the correct folder. The next step is to find the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' within this folder, likely by scrolling.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen to scroll down through the contents of the DCIM folder. The current view shows an image \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\' at the top of the list. This action is intended to reveal more files located below the currently visible area, hopefully including the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the content of the DCIM folder. New items are now visible on the screen, but the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' has not yet been found. The action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by revealing more content, but further scrolling is needed.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen to scroll down through the contents of the DCIM folder. The current view shows an image \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\' at the top of the list. This action is intended to reveal more files located below the currently visible area, hopefully including the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe up action (intended to scroll down) did not result in any visible change on the screen. The same image (\\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\') remained visible. This suggests that the end of the scrollable content in the downward direction has been reached. The action did not bring the agent closer to finding the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[300,500],\"end_point\":[700,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down on the screen (from [300,500] to [700,500]) to scroll up and check if the image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' was missed or is located above the currently visible items. The current view shows an image \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\' at the top of the list. This action is intended to reveal files located above the currently visible area. Actual Outcome: The swipe down action successfully scrolled the content of the DCIM folder upwards. The \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar is now visible at the top. The target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' was not found through this scrolling action. This action helps confirm that simple scrolling is insufficient, pushing the strategy towards using the search functionality again. The agent is closer to exhausting browsing options and moving to a more targeted search.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.48\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 392], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 960.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 674], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.960\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [79, 171, 99, 477], \\'text\\': \\'Search in DCIM\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [154, 7, 167, 206], \\'text\\': \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd Innovation and Excellence\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [175, 7, 180, 184], \\'text\\': \\'2023-01-24, Webcam, 538.40\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [262, 7, 270, 165], \\'text\\': \\'Ihank you for your ourchasel Visir us al: WvW.Tech-adqers-com\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [123, 1, 275, 331]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 634, 113, 727]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [70, 746, 110, 835]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 193, 39, 242]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 851, 111, 940]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [12, 820, 40, 896]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 903, 38, 947]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 40, 41, 193]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,109],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, located to the left of \\'Search in DCIM\\'. The current view is an empty search interface within the DCIM folder. This action is intended to exit the search interface and return to the DCIM folder view, displaying its contents. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon (when \\'Search in DCIM\\' was displayed) successfully exited the search mode. However, instead of returning to the DCIM folder\\'s content view, it returned to a higher-level view where folders are listed, including \\'DCIM\\'. The search bar now displays \\'Search folders\\'. The DCIM folder is visible as an item on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to the subgoal by exiting the failed search, but an additional step is needed to re-enter the DCIM folder to browse its contents.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[307,62],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'DCIM\\' folder. The \\'DCIM\\' folder is currently visible in a list of folders. This action will open the DCIM folder, displaying its contents. The predicted outcome is that the screen will show the files and subfolders within the DCIM directory. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'DCIM\\' folder was successful. The Gallery app navigated into the DCIM folder. The screen now displays the contents of the DCIM folder, and the search bar at the top reads \\'Search in DCIM\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by opening the correct folder. The next step is to find the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' within this folder, likely by scrolling.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen to scroll down through the contents of the DCIM folder. The current view shows an image \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\' at the top of the list. This action is intended to reveal more files located below the currently visible area, hopefully including the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the content of the DCIM folder. New items are now visible on the screen, but the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' has not yet been found. The action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by revealing more content, but further scrolling is needed.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen to scroll down through the contents of the DCIM folder. The current view shows an image \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\' at the top of the list. This action is intended to reveal more files located below the currently visible area, hopefully including the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe up action (intended to scroll down) did not result in any visible change on the screen. The same image (\\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\') remained visible. This suggests that the end of the scrollable content in the downward direction has been reached. The action did not bring the agent closer to finding the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[300,500],\"end_point\":[700,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down on the screen (from [300,500] to [700,500]) to scroll up and check if the image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' was missed or is located above the currently visible items. The current view shows an image \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\' at the top of the list. This action is intended to reveal files located above the currently visible area. Actual Outcome: The swipe down action successfully scrolled the content of the DCIM folder upwards. The \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar is now visible at the top. The target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' was not found through this scrolling action. This action helps confirm that simple scrolling is insufficient, pushing the strategy towards using the search functionality again. The agent is closer to exhausting browsing options and moving to a more targeted search.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 20: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,324],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field. The text field is located at the top of the screen, with text \\'Search in DCIM\\' and bounding box [79, 171, 99, 477]. Tapping its center [89, 324] should activate it and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing for text input to search for the file.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[307,62],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'DCIM\\' folder. The \\'DCIM\\' folder is currently visible in a list of folders. This action will open the DCIM folder, displaying its contents. The predicted outcome is that the screen will show the files and subfolders within the DCIM directory. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'DCIM\\' folder was successful. The Gallery app navigated into the DCIM folder. The screen now displays the contents of the DCIM folder, and the search bar at the top reads \\'Search in DCIM\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by opening the correct folder. The next step is to find the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' within this folder, likely by scrolling.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen to scroll down through the contents of the DCIM folder. The current view shows an image \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\' at the top of the list. This action is intended to reveal more files located below the currently visible area, hopefully including the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the content of the DCIM folder. New items are now visible on the screen, but the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' has not yet been found. The action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by revealing more content, but further scrolling is needed.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen to scroll down through the contents of the DCIM folder. The current view shows an image \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\' at the top of the list. This action is intended to reveal more files located below the currently visible area, hopefully including the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe up action (intended to scroll down) did not result in any visible change on the screen. The same image (\\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\') remained visible. This suggests that the end of the scrollable content in the downward direction has been reached. The action did not bring the agent closer to finding the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[300,500],\"end_point\":[700,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down on the screen (from [300,500] to [700,500]) to scroll up and check if the image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' was missed or is located above the currently visible items. The current view shows an image \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\' at the top of the list. This action is intended to reveal files located above the currently visible area. Actual Outcome: The swipe down action successfully scrolled the content of the DCIM folder upwards. The \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar is now visible at the top. The target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' was not found through this scrolling action. This action helps confirm that simple scrolling is insufficient, pushing the strategy towards using the search functionality again. The agent is closer to exhausting browsing options and moving to a more targeted search.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,324],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field. The text field is located at the top of the screen, with text \\'Search in DCIM\\' and bounding box [79, 171, 99, 477]. Tapping its center [89, 324] should activate it and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing for text input to search for the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field was successful. The text field is now active and focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared (indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\'). The screen content changed to reflect the active input state. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the search interface for input.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.48\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [76, 170, 102, 478], \\'text\\': \\'\u00dfearch in DCIM\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [154, 7, 167, 206], \\'text\\': \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd Innovation and Excellence\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [175, 7, 180, 184], \\'text\\': \\'2023-01-24, Webcam, 538.40\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [262, 7, 270, 165], \\'text\\': \\'Ihank you for your ourchasel Visir us al: WvW.Tech-adqers-com\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [124, 0, 275, 336]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 634, 114, 727]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 747, 110, 835]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 194, 40, 242]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 850, 112, 942]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [13, 820, 40, 895]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 40, 41, 193]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 115, 115, 632]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"1\", text=\"Search in DCIM\", resource-id=\"com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro:id/top_toolbar_search\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[147,149][626,275]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"Search in DCIM\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[307,62],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'DCIM\\' folder. The \\'DCIM\\' folder is currently visible in a list of folders. This action will open the DCIM folder, displaying its contents. The predicted outcome is that the screen will show the files and subfolders within the DCIM directory. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'DCIM\\' folder was successful. The Gallery app navigated into the DCIM folder. The screen now displays the contents of the DCIM folder, and the search bar at the top reads \\'Search in DCIM\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by opening the correct folder. The next step is to find the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' within this folder, likely by scrolling.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen to scroll down through the contents of the DCIM folder. The current view shows an image \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\' at the top of the list. This action is intended to reveal more files located below the currently visible area, hopefully including the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the content of the DCIM folder. New items are now visible on the screen, but the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' has not yet been found. The action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by revealing more content, but further scrolling is needed.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen to scroll down through the contents of the DCIM folder. The current view shows an image \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\' at the top of the list. This action is intended to reveal more files located below the currently visible area, hopefully including the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe up action (intended to scroll down) did not result in any visible change on the screen. The same image (\\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\') remained visible. This suggests that the end of the scrollable content in the downward direction has been reached. The action did not bring the agent closer to finding the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[300,500],\"end_point\":[700,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down on the screen (from [300,500] to [700,500]) to scroll up and check if the image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' was missed or is located above the currently visible items. The current view shows an image \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\' at the top of the list. This action is intended to reveal files located above the currently visible area. Actual Outcome: The swipe down action successfully scrolled the content of the DCIM folder upwards. The \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar is now visible at the top. The target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' was not found through this scrolling action. This action helps confirm that simple scrolling is insufficient, pushing the strategy towards using the search functionality again. The agent is closer to exhausting browsing options and moving to a more targeted search.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,324],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field. The text field is located at the top of the screen, with text \\'Search in DCIM\\' and bounding box [79, 171, 99, 477]. Tapping its center [89, 324] should activate it and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing for text input to search for the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field was successful. The text field is now active and focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared (indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\'). The screen content changed to reflect the active input state. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the search interface for input.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 21: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\\' into the currently focused \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field. The text field currently contains \\'Search in DCIM\\' as placeholder text. This action will replace the placeholder with the filename and the \\'\\\\n\\' will trigger the search. The predicted outcome is that the gallery will search for the specified file, and the screen will update to show the search results. Hopefully, the target image will be displayed. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open \\'Gallery\\' (Simple Gallery Pro) app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'Gallery\\' app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution.

The current view shows an image \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\' at the top of the list. This action is intended to reveal more files located below the currently visible area, hopefully including the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the content of the DCIM folder. New items are now visible on the screen, but the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' has not yet been found. The action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by revealing more content, but further scrolling is needed.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen to scroll down through the contents of the DCIM folder. The current view shows an image \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\' at the top of the list. This action is intended to reveal more files located below the currently visible area, hopefully including the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe up action (intended to scroll down) did not result in any visible change on the screen. The same image (\\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\') remained visible. This suggests that the end of the scrollable content in the downward direction has been reached. The action did not bring the agent closer to finding the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[300,500],\"end_point\":[700,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down on the screen (from [300,500] to [700,500]) to scroll up and check if the image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' was missed or is located above the currently visible items. The current view shows an image \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\' at the top of the list. This action is intended to reveal files located above the currently visible area. Actual Outcome: The swipe down action successfully scrolled the content of the DCIM folder upwards. The \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar is now visible at the top. The target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' was not found through this scrolling action. This action helps confirm that simple scrolling is insufficient, pushing the strategy towards using the search functionality again. The agent is closer to exhausting browsing options and moving to a more targeted search.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,324],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field. The text field is located at the top of the screen, with text \\'Search in DCIM\\' and bounding box [79, 171, 99, 477]. Tapping its center [89, 324] should activate it and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing for text input to search for the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field was successful. The text field is now active and focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared (indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\'). The screen content changed to reflect the active input state. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the search interface for input.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\\' into the currently focused \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field. The text field currently contains \\'Search in DCIM\\' as placeholder text. This action will replace the placeholder with the filename and the \\'\\\\n\\' will trigger the search. The predicted outcome is that the gallery will search for the specified file, and the screen will update to show the search results. Hopefully, the target image will be displayed. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\\' successfully placed the filename into the active search field. The search field now contains \"receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\". However, the search was not executed, as the screen did not update to show any search results; the content below the search bar remained the same. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by preparing the search query, but an explicit step to trigger the search is now necessary.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.49\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [74, 169, 105, 588], \\'text\\': \\'201_22_sure_frog jpg\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [154, 7, 167, 206], \\'text\\': \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd Innovation and Excellence\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [175, 7, 180, 184], \\'text\\': \\'2023-01-24, Webcam, 538.40\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [262, 7, 270, 165], \\'text\\': \\'Ihank you for your ourchasel Visir us al: WvW.Tech-adqers-com\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [124, 0, 275, 336]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 634, 115, 724]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 748, 114, 835]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 194, 39, 241]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 821, 38, 903]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 843, 115, 951]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"1\", text=\"receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\", resource-id=\"com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro:id/top_toolbar_search\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[147,149][626,275]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The current view shows an image \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\' at the top of the list. This action is intended to reveal more files located below the currently visible area, hopefully including the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the content of the DCIM folder. New items are now visible on the screen, but the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' has not yet been found. The action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by revealing more content, but further scrolling is needed.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen to scroll down through the contents of the DCIM folder. The current view shows an image \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\' at the top of the list. This action is intended to reveal more files located below the currently visible area, hopefully including the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe up action (intended to scroll down) did not result in any visible change on the screen. The same image (\\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\') remained visible. This suggests that the end of the scrollable content in the downward direction has been reached. The action did not bring the agent closer to finding the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[300,500],\"end_point\":[700,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down on the screen (from [300,500] to [700,500]) to scroll up and check if the image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' was missed or is located above the currently visible items. The current view shows an image \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\' at the top of the list. This action is intended to reveal files located above the currently visible area. Actual Outcome: The swipe down action successfully scrolled the content of the DCIM folder upwards. The \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar is now visible at the top. The target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' was not found through this scrolling action. This action helps confirm that simple scrolling is insufficient, pushing the strategy towards using the search functionality again. The agent is closer to exhausting browsing options and moving to a more targeted search.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,324],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field. The text field is located at the top of the screen, with text \\'Search in DCIM\\' and bounding box [79, 171, 99, 477]. Tapping its center [89, 324] should activate it and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing for text input to search for the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field was successful. The text field is now active and focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared (indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\'). The screen content changed to reflect the active input state. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the search interface for input.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\\' into the currently focused \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field. The text field currently contains \\'Search in DCIM\\' as placeholder text. This action will replace the placeholder with the filename and the \\'\\\\n\\' will trigger the search. The predicted outcome is that the gallery will search for the specified file, and the screen will update to show the search results. Hopefully, the target image will be displayed. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\\' successfully placed the filename into the active search field. The search field now contains \"receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\". However, the search was not executed, as the screen did not update to show any search results; the content below the search bar remained the same. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by preparing the search query, but an explicit step to trigger the search is now necessary.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 22: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send an ENTER keyevent (keycode 66) to execute the search for \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' in the DCIM folder. The search field is currently focused and contains the correct filename. This action should trigger the search, and the screen should update to show the search results. Hopefully, the target image will be displayed.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps.

The current view shows an image \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\' at the top of the list. This action is intended to reveal more files located below the currently visible area, hopefully including the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe up action (intended to scroll down) did not result in any visible change on the screen. The same image (\\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\') remained visible. This suggests that the end of the scrollable content in the downward direction has been reached. The action did not bring the agent closer to finding the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[300,500],\"end_point\":[700,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down on the screen (from [300,500] to [700,500]) to scroll up and check if the image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' was missed or is located above the currently visible items. The current view shows an image \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\' at the top of the list. This action is intended to reveal files located above the currently visible area. Actual Outcome: The swipe down action successfully scrolled the content of the DCIM folder upwards. The \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar is now visible at the top. The target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' was not found through this scrolling action. This action helps confirm that simple scrolling is insufficient, pushing the strategy towards using the search functionality again. The agent is closer to exhausting browsing options and moving to a more targeted search.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,324],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field. The text field is located at the top of the screen, with text \\'Search in DCIM\\' and bounding box [79, 171, 99, 477]. Tapping its center [89, 324] should activate it and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing for text input to search for the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field was successful. The text field is now active and focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared (indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\'). The screen content changed to reflect the active input state. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the search interface for input.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\\' into the currently focused \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field. The text field currently contains \\'Search in DCIM\\' as placeholder text. This action will replace the placeholder with the filename and the \\'\\\\n\\' will trigger the search. The predicted outcome is that the gallery will search for the specified file, and the screen will update to show the search results. Hopefully, the target image will be displayed. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\\' successfully placed the filename into the active search field. The search field now contains \"receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\". However, the search was not executed, as the screen did not update to show any search results; the content below the search bar remained the same. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by preparing the search query, but an explicit step to trigger the search is now necessary.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send an ENTER keyevent (keycode 66) to execute the search for \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' in the DCIM folder. The search field is currently focused and contains the correct filename. This action should trigger the search, and the screen should update to show the search results. Hopefully, the target image will be displayed. Actual Outcome: The ENTER keyevent was sent to execute the search. The text displayed in the search bar changed, but no search results for \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' were shown. This indicates the image was not found with the full filename. The action was successful in executing the search, but the outcome was that the file was not found. This moves the agent to the next step of trying a partial search, as per the plan.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.50\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [77, 169, 104, 584], \\'text\\': \\'~01_22_sure_frog jpg\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [154, 7, 167, 206], \\'text\\': \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd Innovation and Excellence\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [175, 7, 180, 184], \\'text\\': \\'2023-01-24, Webcam, 538.40\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [262, 7, 270, 165], \\'text\\': \\'Ihank you for your ourchasel Visir us al: WvW.Tech-adqers-com\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [123, 0, 275, 336]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 633, 115, 726]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 747, 115, 837]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 194, 39, 241]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 842, 115, 953]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 821, 38, 893]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"1\", text=\"receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\", resource-id=\"com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro:id/top_toolbar_search\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[147,149][626,275]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The current view shows an image \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\' at the top of the list. This action is intended to reveal more files located below the currently visible area, hopefully including the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe up action (intended to scroll down) did not result in any visible change on the screen. The same image (\\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\') remained visible. This suggests that the end of the scrollable content in the downward direction has been reached. The action did not bring the agent closer to finding the target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[300,500],\"end_point\":[700,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down on the screen (from [300,500] to [700,500]) to scroll up and check if the image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' was missed or is located above the currently visible items. The current view shows an image \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\' at the top of the list. This action is intended to reveal files located above the currently visible area. Actual Outcome: The swipe down action successfully scrolled the content of the DCIM folder upwards. The \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar is now visible at the top. The target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' was not found through this scrolling action. This action helps confirm that simple scrolling is insufficient, pushing the strategy towards using the search functionality again. The agent is closer to exhausting browsing options and moving to a more targeted search.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,324],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field. The text field is located at the top of the screen, with text \\'Search in DCIM\\' and bounding box [79, 171, 99, 477]. Tapping its center [89, 324] should activate it and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing for text input to search for the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field was successful. The text field is now active and focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared (indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\'). The screen content changed to reflect the active input state. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the search interface for input.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\\' into the currently focused \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field. The text field currently contains \\'Search in DCIM\\' as placeholder text. This action will replace the placeholder with the filename and the \\'\\\\n\\' will trigger the search. The predicted outcome is that the gallery will search for the specified file, and the screen will update to show the search results. Hopefully, the target image will be displayed. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\\' successfully placed the filename into the active search field. The search field now contains \"receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\". However, the search was not executed, as the screen did not update to show any search results; the content below the search bar remained the same. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by preparing the search query, but an explicit step to trigger the search is now necessary.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send an ENTER keyevent (keycode 66) to execute the search for \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' in the DCIM folder. The search field is currently focused and contains the correct filename. This action should trigger the search, and the screen should update to show the search results. Hopefully, the target image will be displayed. Actual Outcome: The ENTER keyevent was sent to execute the search. The text displayed in the search bar changed, but no search results for \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' were shown. This indicates the image was not found with the full filename. The action was successful in executing the search, but the outcome was that the file was not found. This moves the agent to the next step of trying a partial search, as per the plan.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 23: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused search field, which contains \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. This will prepare the field for a new search query with a partial filename. The predicted outcome is that the search field will become empty. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open \\'Gallery\\' (Simple Gallery Pro) app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'Gallery\\' app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17.

The current view shows an image \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\' at the top of the list. This action is intended to reveal files located above the currently visible area. Actual Outcome: The swipe down action successfully scrolled the content of the DCIM folder upwards. The \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar is now visible at the top. The target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' was not found through this scrolling action. This action helps confirm that simple scrolling is insufficient, pushing the strategy towards using the search functionality again. The agent is closer to exhausting browsing options and moving to a more targeted search.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,324],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field. The text field is located at the top of the screen, with text \\'Search in DCIM\\' and bounding box [79, 171, 99, 477]. Tapping its center [89, 324] should activate it and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing for text input to search for the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field was successful. The text field is now active and focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared (indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\'). The screen content changed to reflect the active input state. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the search interface for input.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\\' into the currently focused \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field. The text field currently contains \\'Search in DCIM\\' as placeholder text. This action will replace the placeholder with the filename and the \\'\\\\n\\' will trigger the search. The predicted outcome is that the gallery will search for the specified file, and the screen will update to show the search results. Hopefully, the target image will be displayed. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\\' successfully placed the filename into the active search field. The search field now contains \"receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\". However, the search was not executed, as the screen did not update to show any search results; the content below the search bar remained the same. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by preparing the search query, but an explicit step to trigger the search is now necessary.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send an ENTER keyevent (keycode 66) to execute the search for \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' in the DCIM folder. The search field is currently focused and contains the correct filename. This action should trigger the search, and the screen should update to show the search results. Hopefully, the target image will be displayed. Actual Outcome: The ENTER keyevent was sent to execute the search. The text displayed in the search bar changed, but no search results for \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' were shown. This indicates the image was not found with the full filename. The action was successful in executing the search, but the outcome was that the file was not found. This moves the agent to the next step of trying a partial search, as per the plan.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused search field, which contains \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. This will prepare the field for a new search query with a partial filename. The predicted outcome is that the search field will become empty. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' was successful. The previous search query \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' was removed from the search field. The search field now displays its placeholder text \\'Search in DCIM\\' and remains focused, with the virtual keyboard active. This prepares the agent for the next step of inputting a partial filename to continue the search for the target image, thus bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.50\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [76, 170, 102, 478], \\'text\\': \\'\u00dfearch in DCIM\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [154, 7, 167, 206], \\'text\\': \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd Innovation and Excellence\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [175, 7, 180, 184], \\'text\\': \\'2023-01-24, Webcam, 538.40\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [262, 7, 270, 165], \\'text\\': \\'Ihank you for your ourchasel Visir us al: WvW.Tech-adqers-com\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [124, 0, 275, 336]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 634, 114, 727]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 747, 110, 835]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 194, 40, 242]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [13, 821, 38, 899]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 850, 112, 942]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 903, 38, 947]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 114, 115, 633]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"1\", text=\"Search in DCIM\", resource-id=\"com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro:id/top_toolbar_search\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[147,149][626,275]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"Search in DCIM\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The current view shows an image \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd...\\' at the top of the list. This action is intended to reveal files located above the currently visible area. Actual Outcome: The swipe down action successfully scrolled the content of the DCIM folder upwards. The \\'Search in DCIM\\' bar is now visible at the top. The target image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' was not found through this scrolling action. This action helps confirm that simple scrolling is insufficient, pushing the strategy towards using the search functionality again. The agent is closer to exhausting browsing options and moving to a more targeted search.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,324],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field. The text field is located at the top of the screen, with text \\'Search in DCIM\\' and bounding box [79, 171, 99, 477]. Tapping its center [89, 324] should activate it and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing for text input to search for the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field was successful. The text field is now active and focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared (indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\'). The screen content changed to reflect the active input state. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the search interface for input.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\\' into the currently focused \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field. The text field currently contains \\'Search in DCIM\\' as placeholder text. This action will replace the placeholder with the filename and the \\'\\\\n\\' will trigger the search. The predicted outcome is that the gallery will search for the specified file, and the screen will update to show the search results. Hopefully, the target image will be displayed. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\\' successfully placed the filename into the active search field. The search field now contains \"receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\". However, the search was not executed, as the screen did not update to show any search results; the content below the search bar remained the same. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by preparing the search query, but an explicit step to trigger the search is now necessary.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send an ENTER keyevent (keycode 66) to execute the search for \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' in the DCIM folder. The search field is currently focused and contains the correct filename. This action should trigger the search, and the screen should update to show the search results. Hopefully, the target image will be displayed. Actual Outcome: The ENTER keyevent was sent to execute the search. The text displayed in the search bar changed, but no search results for \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' were shown. This indicates the image was not found with the full filename. The action was successful in executing the search, but the outcome was that the file was not found. This moves the agent to the next step of trying a partial search, as per the plan.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused search field, which contains \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. This will prepare the field for a new search query with a partial filename. The predicted outcome is that the search field will become empty. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' was successful. The previous search query \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' was removed from the search field. The search field now displays its placeholder text \\'Search in DCIM\\' and remains focused, with the virtual keyboard active. This prepares the agent for the next step of inputting a partial filename to continue the search for the target image, thus bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 24: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"frog\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the partial filename \\'frog\\' into the currently focused \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field. The text field currently displays \\'Search in DCIM\\' as placeholder text. This action will replace the placeholder with \\'frog\\'. The predicted outcome is that the search field will contain \\'frog\\', preparing for the search execution in the next step. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open \\'Gallery\\' (Simple Gallery Pro) app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'Gallery\\' app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,324],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field. The text field is located at the top of the screen, with text \\'Search in DCIM\\' and bounding box [79, 171, 99, 477]. Tapping its center [89, 324] should activate it and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing for text input to search for the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field was successful. The text field is now active and focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared (indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\'). The screen content changed to reflect the active input state. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the search interface for input.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\\' into the currently focused \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field. The text field currently contains \\'Search in DCIM\\' as placeholder text. This action will replace the placeholder with the filename and the \\'\\\\n\\' will trigger the search. The predicted outcome is that the gallery will search for the specified file, and the screen will update to show the search results. Hopefully, the target image will be displayed. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\\' successfully placed the filename into the active search field. The search field now contains \"receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\". However, the search was not executed, as the screen did not update to show any search results; the content below the search bar remained the same. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by preparing the search query, but an explicit step to trigger the search is now necessary.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send an ENTER keyevent (keycode 66) to execute the search for \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' in the DCIM folder. The search field is currently focused and contains the correct filename. This action should trigger the search, and the screen should update to show the search results. Hopefully, the target image will be displayed. Actual Outcome: The ENTER keyevent was sent to execute the search. The text displayed in the search bar changed, but no search results for \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' were shown. This indicates the image was not found with the full filename. The action was successful in executing the search, but the outcome was that the file was not found. This moves the agent to the next step of trying a partial search, as per the plan.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused search field, which contains \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. This will prepare the field for a new search query with a partial filename. The predicted outcome is that the search field will become empty. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' was successful. The previous search query \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' was removed from the search field. The search field now displays its placeholder text \\'Search in DCIM\\' and remains focused, with the virtual keyboard active. This prepares the agent for the next step of inputting a partial filename to continue the search for the target image, thus bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"frog\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the partial filename \\'frog\\' into the currently focused \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field. The text field currently displays \\'Search in DCIM\\' as placeholder text. This action will replace the placeholder with \\'frog\\'. The predicted outcome is that the search field will contain \\'frog\\', preparing for the search execution in the next step. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'frog\\' into the search field was successful. The search field, which previously displayed \\'Search in DCIM\\', now contains the text \\'frog\\'. The virtual keyboard is still active. No search results are displayed yet, as the search has not been executed. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the partial search query.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 132], \\'text\\': \\'15.51\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [75, 167, 104, 262], \\'text\\': \\'frog\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [154, 7, 167, 206], \\'text\\': \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd Innovation and Excellence\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [175, 7, 180, 184], \\'text\\': \\'2023-01-24, Webcam, 538.40\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [262, 7, 270, 165], \\'text\\': \\'Ihank you for your ourchasel Visir us al: WvW.Tech-adqers-com\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [123, 0, 275, 331]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 635, 115, 726]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 747, 114, 836]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 821, 36, 899]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 194, 38, 241]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 844, 115, 952]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 903, 37, 946]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [73, 169, 105, 263]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"1\", text=\"frog\", resource-id=\"com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro:id/top_toolbar_search\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[147,149][626,275]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"frog\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,324],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field. The text field is located at the top of the screen, with text \\'Search in DCIM\\' and bounding box [79, 171, 99, 477]. Tapping its center [89, 324] should activate it and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing for text input to search for the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field was successful. The text field is now active and focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared (indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\'). The screen content changed to reflect the active input state. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the search interface for input.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\\' into the currently focused \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field. The text field currently contains \\'Search in DCIM\\' as placeholder text. This action will replace the placeholder with the filename and the \\'\\\\n\\' will trigger the search. The predicted outcome is that the gallery will search for the specified file, and the screen will update to show the search results. Hopefully, the target image will be displayed. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\\' successfully placed the filename into the active search field. The search field now contains \"receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\". However, the search was not executed, as the screen did not update to show any search results; the content below the search bar remained the same. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by preparing the search query, but an explicit step to trigger the search is now necessary.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send an ENTER keyevent (keycode 66) to execute the search for \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' in the DCIM folder. The search field is currently focused and contains the correct filename. This action should trigger the search, and the screen should update to show the search results. Hopefully, the target image will be displayed. Actual Outcome: The ENTER keyevent was sent to execute the search. The text displayed in the search bar changed, but no search results for \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' were shown. This indicates the image was not found with the full filename. The action was successful in executing the search, but the outcome was that the file was not found. This moves the agent to the next step of trying a partial search, as per the plan.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused search field, which contains \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. This will prepare the field for a new search query with a partial filename. The predicted outcome is that the search field will become empty. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' was successful. The previous search query \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' was removed from the search field. The search field now displays its placeholder text \\'Search in DCIM\\' and remains focused, with the virtual keyboard active. This prepares the agent for the next step of inputting a partial filename to continue the search for the target image, thus bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"frog\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the partial filename \\'frog\\' into the currently focused \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field. The text field currently displays \\'Search in DCIM\\' as placeholder text. This action will replace the placeholder with \\'frog\\'. The predicted outcome is that the search field will contain \\'frog\\', preparing for the search execution in the next step. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'frog\\' into the search field was successful. The search field, which previously displayed \\'Search in DCIM\\', now contains the text \\'frog\\'. The virtual keyboard is still active. No search results are displayed yet, as the search has not been executed. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the partial search query.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 25: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send an ENTER keyevent (keycode 66) to execute the search for \\'frog\\' in the DCIM folder. The search field is currently focused and contains \\'frog\\'. This action should trigger the search, and the screen should update to show the search results. Hopefully, the target image will be displayed. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open \\'Gallery\\' (Simple Gallery Pro) app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'Gallery\\' app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution.

The text field currently contains \\'Search in DCIM\\' as placeholder text. This action will replace the placeholder with the filename and the \\'\\\\n\\' will trigger the search. The predicted outcome is that the gallery will search for the specified file, and the screen will update to show the search results. Hopefully, the target image will be displayed. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\\' successfully placed the filename into the active search field. The search field now contains \"receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\". However, the search was not executed, as the screen did not update to show any search results; the content below the search bar remained the same. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by preparing the search query, but an explicit step to trigger the search is now necessary.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send an ENTER keyevent (keycode 66) to execute the search for \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' in the DCIM folder. The search field is currently focused and contains the correct filename. This action should trigger the search, and the screen should update to show the search results. Hopefully, the target image will be displayed. Actual Outcome: The ENTER keyevent was sent to execute the search. The text displayed in the search bar changed, but no search results for \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' were shown. This indicates the image was not found with the full filename. The action was successful in executing the search, but the outcome was that the file was not found. This moves the agent to the next step of trying a partial search, as per the plan.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused search field, which contains \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. This will prepare the field for a new search query with a partial filename. The predicted outcome is that the search field will become empty. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' was successful. The previous search query \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' was removed from the search field. The search field now displays its placeholder text \\'Search in DCIM\\' and remains focused, with the virtual keyboard active. This prepares the agent for the next step of inputting a partial filename to continue the search for the target image, thus bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"frog\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the partial filename \\'frog\\' into the currently focused \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field. The text field currently displays \\'Search in DCIM\\' as placeholder text. This action will replace the placeholder with \\'frog\\'. The predicted outcome is that the search field will contain \\'frog\\', preparing for the search execution in the next step. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'frog\\' into the search field was successful. The search field, which previously displayed \\'Search in DCIM\\', now contains the text \\'frog\\'. The virtual keyboard is still active. No search results are displayed yet, as the search has not been executed. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the partial search query.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send an ENTER keyevent (keycode 66) to execute the search for \\'frog\\' in the DCIM folder. The search field is currently focused and contains \\'frog\\'. This action should trigger the search, and the screen should update to show the search results. Hopefully, the target image will be displayed. Actual Outcome: The action of sending an ENTER keyevent (keycode 66) did not result in any visible change on the screen. The search text \\'frog\\' remained in the search bar, and no search results were displayed. Therefore, the image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' was not found using the partial name \\'frog\\'. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of locating the image.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 132], \\'text\\': \\'15.51\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [154, 7, 167, 206], \\'text\\': \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd Innovation and Excellence\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [175, 7, 180, 184], \\'text\\': \\'2023-01-24, Webcam, 538.40\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [262, 7, 270, 165], \\'text\\': \\'Ihank you for your ourchasel Visir us al: WvW.Tech-adqers-com\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [78, 163, 103, 261], \\'text\\': \\'frog\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [123, 0, 275, 331]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 633, 114, 727]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 746, 114, 838]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 194, 38, 241]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 845, 114, 951]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 821, 38, 893]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 904, 38, 947]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"1\", text=\"frog\", resource-id=\"com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro:id/top_toolbar_search\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[147,149][626,275]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"frog\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text field currently contains \\'Search in DCIM\\' as placeholder text. This action will replace the placeholder with the filename and the \\'\\\\n\\' will trigger the search. The predicted outcome is that the gallery will search for the specified file, and the screen will update to show the search results. Hopefully, the target image will be displayed. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\\\n\\' successfully placed the filename into the active search field. The search field now contains \"receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\". However, the search was not executed, as the screen did not update to show any search results; the content below the search bar remained the same. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by preparing the search query, but an explicit step to trigger the search is now necessary.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send an ENTER keyevent (keycode 66) to execute the search for \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' in the DCIM folder. The search field is currently focused and contains the correct filename. This action should trigger the search, and the screen should update to show the search results. Hopefully, the target image will be displayed. Actual Outcome: The ENTER keyevent was sent to execute the search. The text displayed in the search bar changed, but no search results for \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' were shown. This indicates the image was not found with the full filename. The action was successful in executing the search, but the outcome was that the file was not found. This moves the agent to the next step of trying a partial search, as per the plan.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused search field, which contains \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. This will prepare the field for a new search query with a partial filename. The predicted outcome is that the search field will become empty. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' was successful. The previous search query \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' was removed from the search field. The search field now displays its placeholder text \\'Search in DCIM\\' and remains focused, with the virtual keyboard active. This prepares the agent for the next step of inputting a partial filename to continue the search for the target image, thus bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"frog\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the partial filename \\'frog\\' into the currently focused \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field. The text field currently displays \\'Search in DCIM\\' as placeholder text. This action will replace the placeholder with \\'frog\\'. The predicted outcome is that the search field will contain \\'frog\\', preparing for the search execution in the next step. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'frog\\' into the search field was successful. The search field, which previously displayed \\'Search in DCIM\\', now contains the text \\'frog\\'. The virtual keyboard is still active. No search results are displayed yet, as the search has not been executed. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the partial search query.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send an ENTER keyevent (keycode 66) to execute the search for \\'frog\\' in the DCIM folder. The search field is currently focused and contains \\'frog\\'. This action should trigger the search, and the screen should update to show the search results. Hopefully, the target image will be displayed. Actual Outcome: The action of sending an ENTER keyevent (keycode 66) did not result in any visible change on the screen. The search text \\'frog\\' remained in the search bar, and no search results were displayed. Therefore, the image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' was not found using the partial name \\'frog\\'. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of locating the image.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 26: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,100],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, located to the left of the search text \\'frog\\' (estimated center [90, 100]). This action is intended to close the search interface and return to the DCIM folder view, allowing for a visual inspection of its contents. The search bar currently contains \\'frog\\'.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The search field is currently focused and contains the correct filename. This action should trigger the search, and the screen should update to show the search results. Hopefully, the target image will be displayed. Actual Outcome: The ENTER keyevent was sent to execute the search. The text displayed in the search bar changed, but no search results for \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' were shown. This indicates the image was not found with the full filename. The action was successful in executing the search, but the outcome was that the file was not found. This moves the agent to the next step of trying a partial search, as per the plan.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused search field, which contains \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. This will prepare the field for a new search query with a partial filename. The predicted outcome is that the search field will become empty. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' was successful. The previous search query \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' was removed from the search field. The search field now displays its placeholder text \\'Search in DCIM\\' and remains focused, with the virtual keyboard active. This prepares the agent for the next step of inputting a partial filename to continue the search for the target image, thus bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"frog\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the partial filename \\'frog\\' into the currently focused \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field. The text field currently displays \\'Search in DCIM\\' as placeholder text. This action will replace the placeholder with \\'frog\\'. The predicted outcome is that the search field will contain \\'frog\\', preparing for the search execution in the next step. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'frog\\' into the search field was successful. The search field, which previously displayed \\'Search in DCIM\\', now contains the text \\'frog\\'. The virtual keyboard is still active. No search results are displayed yet, as the search has not been executed. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the partial search query.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send an ENTER keyevent (keycode 66) to execute the search for \\'frog\\' in the DCIM folder. The search field is currently focused and contains \\'frog\\'. This action should trigger the search, and the screen should update to show the search results. Hopefully, the target image will be displayed. Actual Outcome: The action of sending an ENTER keyevent (keycode 66) did not result in any visible change on the screen. The search text \\'frog\\' remained in the search bar, and no search results were displayed. Therefore, the image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' was not found using the partial name \\'frog\\'. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of locating the image.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,100],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, located to the left of the search text \\'frog\\' (estimated center [90, 100]). This action is intended to close the search interface and return to the DCIM folder view, allowing for a visual inspection of its contents. The search bar currently contains \\'frog\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon cleared the search text \\'frog\\' from the search bar. The search bar now displays \\'Search in DCIM\\'. The virtual keyboard is no longer visible. However, the agent is still within the search interface of the DCIM folder and has not returned to the general folder view. Therefore, the action did not fully achieve its intended outcome of closing the search interface. It did not bring the agent closer to locating the image by visual inspection, as the folder view is not visible.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.53\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [79, 171, 99, 477], \\'text\\': \\'Search in DCIM\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [154, 7, 167, 206], \\'text\\': \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd Innovation and Excellence\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [175, 7, 180, 184], \\'text\\': \\'2023-01-24, Webcam, 538.40\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [262, 7, 270, 165], \\'text\\': \\'Ihank you for your ourchasel Visir us al: WvW.Tech-adqers-com\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [124, 0, 275, 336]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 633, 114, 726]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 746, 110, 836]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 193, 39, 242]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 848, 112, 948]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [11, 819, 42, 945]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The search field is currently focused and contains the correct filename. This action should trigger the search, and the screen should update to show the search results. Hopefully, the target image will be displayed. Actual Outcome: The ENTER keyevent was sent to execute the search. The text displayed in the search bar changed, but no search results for \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' were shown. This indicates the image was not found with the full filename. The action was successful in executing the search, but the outcome was that the file was not found. This moves the agent to the next step of trying a partial search, as per the plan.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused search field, which contains \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. This will prepare the field for a new search query with a partial filename. The predicted outcome is that the search field will become empty. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' was successful. The previous search query \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' was removed from the search field. The search field now displays its placeholder text \\'Search in DCIM\\' and remains focused, with the virtual keyboard active. This prepares the agent for the next step of inputting a partial filename to continue the search for the target image, thus bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"frog\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the partial filename \\'frog\\' into the currently focused \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field. The text field currently displays \\'Search in DCIM\\' as placeholder text. This action will replace the placeholder with \\'frog\\'. The predicted outcome is that the search field will contain \\'frog\\', preparing for the search execution in the next step. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'frog\\' into the search field was successful. The search field, which previously displayed \\'Search in DCIM\\', now contains the text \\'frog\\'. The virtual keyboard is still active. No search results are displayed yet, as the search has not been executed. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the partial search query.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send an ENTER keyevent (keycode 66) to execute the search for \\'frog\\' in the DCIM folder. The search field is currently focused and contains \\'frog\\'. This action should trigger the search, and the screen should update to show the search results. Hopefully, the target image will be displayed. Actual Outcome: The action of sending an ENTER keyevent (keycode 66) did not result in any visible change on the screen. The search text \\'frog\\' remained in the search bar, and no search results were displayed. Therefore, the image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' was not found using the partial name \\'frog\\'. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of locating the image.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,100],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, located to the left of the search text \\'frog\\' (estimated center [90, 100]). This action is intended to close the search interface and return to the DCIM folder view, allowing for a visual inspection of its contents. The search bar currently contains \\'frog\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon cleared the search text \\'frog\\' from the search bar. The search bar now displays \\'Search in DCIM\\'. The virtual keyboard is no longer visible. However, the agent is still within the search interface of the DCIM folder and has not returned to the general folder view. Therefore, the action did not fully achieve its intended outcome of closing the search interface. It did not bring the agent closer to locating the image by visual inspection, as the folder view is not visible.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 27: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a system back keyevent (keycode \\'KEYCODE_BACK\\') to close the current search interface. The current screen shows the \\'Search in DCIM\\' interface. This action is predicted to return the view to the DCIM folder, allowing for visual inspection of its contents. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open \\'Gallery\\' (Simple Gallery Pro) app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'Gallery\\' app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused search field, which contains \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. This will prepare the field for a new search query with a partial filename. The predicted outcome is that the search field will become empty. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' was successful. The previous search query \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' was removed from the search field. The search field now displays its placeholder text \\'Search in DCIM\\' and remains focused, with the virtual keyboard active. This prepares the agent for the next step of inputting a partial filename to continue the search for the target image, thus bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"frog\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the partial filename \\'frog\\' into the currently focused \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field. The text field currently displays \\'Search in DCIM\\' as placeholder text. This action will replace the placeholder with \\'frog\\'. The predicted outcome is that the search field will contain \\'frog\\', preparing for the search execution in the next step. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'frog\\' into the search field was successful. The search field, which previously displayed \\'Search in DCIM\\', now contains the text \\'frog\\'. The virtual keyboard is still active. No search results are displayed yet, as the search has not been executed. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the partial search query.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send an ENTER keyevent (keycode 66) to execute the search for \\'frog\\' in the DCIM folder. The search field is currently focused and contains \\'frog\\'. This action should trigger the search, and the screen should update to show the search results. Hopefully, the target image will be displayed. Actual Outcome: The action of sending an ENTER keyevent (keycode 66) did not result in any visible change on the screen. The search text \\'frog\\' remained in the search bar, and no search results were displayed. Therefore, the image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' was not found using the partial name \\'frog\\'. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of locating the image.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,100],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, located to the left of the search text \\'frog\\' (estimated center [90, 100]). This action is intended to close the search interface and return to the DCIM folder view, allowing for a visual inspection of its contents. The search bar currently contains \\'frog\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon cleared the search text \\'frog\\' from the search bar. The search bar now displays \\'Search in DCIM\\'. The virtual keyboard is no longer visible. However, the agent is still within the search interface of the DCIM folder and has not returned to the general folder view. Therefore, the action did not fully achieve its intended outcome of closing the search interface. It did not bring the agent closer to locating the image by visual inspection, as the folder view is not visible.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a system back keyevent (keycode \\'KEYCODE_BACK\\') to close the current search interface. The current screen shows the \\'Search in DCIM\\' interface. This action is predicted to return the view to the DCIM folder, allowing for visual inspection of its contents. Actual Outcome: The system back keyevent successfully navigated from the \\'Search in DCIM\\' interface to a \\'Search folders\\' interface where the \\'DCIM\\' folder is now visible as a selectable item. This brings the agent closer to visually inspecting the DCIM folder\\'s contents.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.53\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [79, 171, 99, 461], \\'text\\': \\'Search folders\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [168, 7, 189, 307], \\'text\\': \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd_ Innovation and Excellence\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [199, 8, 209, 275], \\'text\\': \\'2023-01-24, Webcam, $38.40\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [299, 18, 315, 107], \\'text\\': \\'DCIM\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [330, 11, 344, 247], \\'text\\': \\'you for your purchase! Visit us at: WWW tech-gadgets com\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 640, 114, 723]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 194, 39, 242]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 753, 114, 839]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 853, 112, 945]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [143, 0, 351, 500]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 139, 39, 188]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [13, 819, 40, 893]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 901, 40, 947]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete all text from the currently focused search field, which contains \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\'. This will prepare the field for a new search query with a partial filename. The predicted outcome is that the search field will become empty. Actual Outcome: The action \\'Deletes all text in the currently focused text field\\' was successful. The previous search query \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' was removed from the search field. The search field now displays its placeholder text \\'Search in DCIM\\' and remains focused, with the virtual keyboard active. This prepares the agent for the next step of inputting a partial filename to continue the search for the target image, thus bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"frog\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the partial filename \\'frog\\' into the currently focused \\'Search in DCIM\\' text field. The text field currently displays \\'Search in DCIM\\' as placeholder text. This action will replace the placeholder with \\'frog\\'. The predicted outcome is that the search field will contain \\'frog\\', preparing for the search execution in the next step. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'frog\\' into the search field was successful. The search field, which previously displayed \\'Search in DCIM\\', now contains the text \\'frog\\'. The virtual keyboard is still active. No search results are displayed yet, as the search has not been executed. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the partial search query.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send an ENTER keyevent (keycode 66) to execute the search for \\'frog\\' in the DCIM folder. The search field is currently focused and contains \\'frog\\'. This action should trigger the search, and the screen should update to show the search results. Hopefully, the target image will be displayed. Actual Outcome: The action of sending an ENTER keyevent (keycode 66) did not result in any visible change on the screen. The search text \\'frog\\' remained in the search bar, and no search results were displayed. Therefore, the image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' was not found using the partial name \\'frog\\'. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of locating the image.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,100],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, located to the left of the search text \\'frog\\' (estimated center [90, 100]). This action is intended to close the search interface and return to the DCIM folder view, allowing for a visual inspection of its contents. The search bar currently contains \\'frog\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon cleared the search text \\'frog\\' from the search bar. The search bar now displays \\'Search in DCIM\\'. The virtual keyboard is no longer visible. However, the agent is still within the search interface of the DCIM folder and has not returned to the general folder view. Therefore, the action did not fully achieve its intended outcome of closing the search interface. It did not bring the agent closer to locating the image by visual inspection, as the folder view is not visible.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a system back keyevent (keycode \\'KEYCODE_BACK\\') to close the current search interface. The current screen shows the \\'Search in DCIM\\' interface. This action is predicted to return the view to the DCIM folder, allowing for visual inspection of its contents. Actual Outcome: The system back keyevent successfully navigated from the \\'Search in DCIM\\' interface to a \\'Search folders\\' interface where the \\'DCIM\\' folder is now visible as a selectable item. This brings the agent closer to visually inspecting the DCIM folder\\'s contents.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 28: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[247,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'DCIM\\' folder item, which is visible on the screen. The center of the DCIM folder item is approximately [247, 250]. This action is intended to open the DCIM folder, allowing for visual inspection of its contents to find the target image. The predicted outcome is that the screen will display the contents of the DCIM folder. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open \\'Gallery\\' (Simple Gallery Pro) app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'Gallery\\' app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text field currently displays \\'Search in DCIM\\' as placeholder text. This action will replace the placeholder with \\'frog\\'. The predicted outcome is that the search field will contain \\'frog\\', preparing for the search execution in the next step. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'frog\\' into the search field was successful. The search field, which previously displayed \\'Search in DCIM\\', now contains the text \\'frog\\'. The virtual keyboard is still active. No search results are displayed yet, as the search has not been executed. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the partial search query.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send an ENTER keyevent (keycode 66) to execute the search for \\'frog\\' in the DCIM folder. The search field is currently focused and contains \\'frog\\'. This action should trigger the search, and the screen should update to show the search results. Hopefully, the target image will be displayed. Actual Outcome: The action of sending an ENTER keyevent (keycode 66) did not result in any visible change on the screen. The search text \\'frog\\' remained in the search bar, and no search results were displayed. Therefore, the image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' was not found using the partial name \\'frog\\'. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of locating the image.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,100],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, located to the left of the search text \\'frog\\' (estimated center [90, 100]). This action is intended to close the search interface and return to the DCIM folder view, allowing for a visual inspection of its contents. The search bar currently contains \\'frog\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon cleared the search text \\'frog\\' from the search bar. The search bar now displays \\'Search in DCIM\\'. The virtual keyboard is no longer visible. However, the agent is still within the search interface of the DCIM folder and has not returned to the general folder view. Therefore, the action did not fully achieve its intended outcome of closing the search interface. It did not bring the agent closer to locating the image by visual inspection, as the folder view is not visible.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a system back keyevent (keycode \\'KEYCODE_BACK\\') to close the current search interface. The current screen shows the \\'Search in DCIM\\' interface. This action is predicted to return the view to the DCIM folder, allowing for visual inspection of its contents. Actual Outcome: The system back keyevent successfully navigated from the \\'Search in DCIM\\' interface to a \\'Search folders\\' interface where the \\'DCIM\\' folder is now visible as a selectable item. This brings the agent closer to visually inspecting the DCIM folder\\'s contents.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[247,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'DCIM\\' folder item, which is visible on the screen. The center of the DCIM folder item is approximately [247, 250]. This action is intended to open the DCIM folder, allowing for visual inspection of its contents to find the target image. The predicted outcome is that the screen will display the contents of the DCIM folder. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'DCIM\\' folder (at approximately [247, 250]) did not open the folder to display its contents. Instead, it navigated to the \\'Search in DCIM\\' interface. The search bar now reads \\'Search in DCIM\\'. This outcome was not intended, as the goal was to visually inspect the folder. The action did not bring the agent closer to locating the image by visual inspection, as the folder contents are not visible.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.54\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [79, 171, 99, 477], \\'text\\': \\'Search in DCIM\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [154, 7, 167, 206], \\'text\\': \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd Innovation and Excellence\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [175, 7, 180, 184], \\'text\\': \\'2023-01-24, Webcam, 538.40\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [262, 7, 270, 165], \\'text\\': \\'Ihank you for your ourchasel Visir us al: WvW.Tech-adqers-com\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [123, 0, 275, 331]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 633, 114, 727]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 747, 110, 836]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 848, 111, 948]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 193, 39, 242]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [11, 819, 42, 895]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [13, 904, 40, 948]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 40, 41, 196]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text field currently displays \\'Search in DCIM\\' as placeholder text. This action will replace the placeholder with \\'frog\\'. The predicted outcome is that the search field will contain \\'frog\\', preparing for the search execution in the next step. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'frog\\' into the search field was successful. The search field, which previously displayed \\'Search in DCIM\\', now contains the text \\'frog\\'. The virtual keyboard is still active. No search results are displayed yet, as the search has not been executed. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the partial search query.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"66\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send an ENTER keyevent (keycode 66) to execute the search for \\'frog\\' in the DCIM folder. The search field is currently focused and contains \\'frog\\'. This action should trigger the search, and the screen should update to show the search results. Hopefully, the target image will be displayed. Actual Outcome: The action of sending an ENTER keyevent (keycode 66) did not result in any visible change on the screen. The search text \\'frog\\' remained in the search bar, and no search results were displayed. Therefore, the image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' was not found using the partial name \\'frog\\'. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of locating the image.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,100],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, located to the left of the search text \\'frog\\' (estimated center [90, 100]). This action is intended to close the search interface and return to the DCIM folder view, allowing for a visual inspection of its contents. The search bar currently contains \\'frog\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon cleared the search text \\'frog\\' from the search bar. The search bar now displays \\'Search in DCIM\\'. The virtual keyboard is no longer visible. However, the agent is still within the search interface of the DCIM folder and has not returned to the general folder view. Therefore, the action did not fully achieve its intended outcome of closing the search interface. It did not bring the agent closer to locating the image by visual inspection, as the folder view is not visible.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a system back keyevent (keycode \\'KEYCODE_BACK\\') to close the current search interface. The current screen shows the \\'Search in DCIM\\' interface. This action is predicted to return the view to the DCIM folder, allowing for visual inspection of its contents. Actual Outcome: The system back keyevent successfully navigated from the \\'Search in DCIM\\' interface to a \\'Search folders\\' interface where the \\'DCIM\\' folder is now visible as a selectable item. This brings the agent closer to visually inspecting the DCIM folder\\'s contents.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[247,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'DCIM\\' folder item, which is visible on the screen. The center of the DCIM folder item is approximately [247, 250]. This action is intended to open the DCIM folder, allowing for visual inspection of its contents to find the target image. The predicted outcome is that the screen will display the contents of the DCIM folder. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'DCIM\\' folder (at approximately [247, 250]) did not open the folder to display its contents. Instead, it navigated to the \\'Search in DCIM\\' interface. The search bar now reads \\'Search in DCIM\\'. This outcome was not intended, as the goal was to visually inspect the folder. The action did not bring the agent closer to locating the image by visual inspection, as the folder contents are not visible.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 29: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a system back keyevent (keycode \\'KEYCODE_BACK\\') to attempt to exit the current \\'Search in DCIM\\' interface. The current screen shows \\'Search in DCIM\\'. The predicted outcome is that this action will navigate to a previous screen, hopefully allowing access to the DCIM folder\\'s contents directly, or at least to a higher-level folder view. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open \\'Gallery\\' (Simple Gallery Pro) app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'Gallery\\' app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is the same screen that was visible after step 27.

This indicates that tapping a folder name on the 'Search folders' screen initiates a search within that folder, not browsing. To escape this loop and attempt to reach a browsable view of the DCIM folder, the next logical step is to try another `KEYCODE_BACK` action.

The search field is currently focused and contains \\'frog\\'. This action should trigger the search, and the screen should update to show the search results. Hopefully, the target image will be displayed. Actual Outcome: The action of sending an ENTER keyevent (keycode 66) did not result in any visible change on the screen. The search text \\'frog\\' remained in the search bar, and no search results were displayed. Therefore, the image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' was not found using the partial name \\'frog\\'. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of locating the image.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,100],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, located to the left of the search text \\'frog\\' (estimated center [90, 100]). This action is intended to close the search interface and return to the DCIM folder view, allowing for a visual inspection of its contents. The search bar currently contains \\'frog\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon cleared the search text \\'frog\\' from the search bar. The search bar now displays \\'Search in DCIM\\'. The virtual keyboard is no longer visible. However, the agent is still within the search interface of the DCIM folder and has not returned to the general folder view. Therefore, the action did not fully achieve its intended outcome of closing the search interface. It did not bring the agent closer to locating the image by visual inspection, as the folder view is not visible.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a system back keyevent (keycode \\'KEYCODE_BACK\\') to close the current search interface. The current screen shows the \\'Search in DCIM\\' interface. This action is predicted to return the view to the DCIM folder, allowing for visual inspection of its contents. Actual Outcome: The system back keyevent successfully navigated from the \\'Search in DCIM\\' interface to a \\'Search folders\\' interface where the \\'DCIM\\' folder is now visible as a selectable item. This brings the agent closer to visually inspecting the DCIM folder\\'s contents.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[247,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'DCIM\\' folder item, which is visible on the screen. The center of the DCIM folder item is approximately [247, 250]. This action is intended to open the DCIM folder, allowing for visual inspection of its contents to find the target image. The predicted outcome is that the screen will display the contents of the DCIM folder. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'DCIM\\' folder (at approximately [247, 250]) did not open the folder to display its contents. Instead, it navigated to the \\'Search in DCIM\\' interface. The search bar now reads \\'Search in DCIM\\'. This outcome was not intended, as the goal was to visually inspect the folder. The action did not bring the agent closer to locating the image by visual inspection, as the folder contents are not visible.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a system back keyevent (keycode \\'KEYCODE_BACK\\') to attempt to exit the current \\'Search in DCIM\\' interface. The current screen shows \\'Search in DCIM\\'. The predicted outcome is that this action will navigate to a previous screen, hopefully allowing access to the DCIM folder\\'s contents directly, or at least to a higher-level folder view. Actual Outcome: The action of sending a system back keyevent (`KEYCODE_BACK`) successfully navigated from the \\'Search in DCIM\\' interface to the \\'Search folders\\' interface. The \\'DCIM\\' folder is now visible as a selectable item. This action effectively undid the previous tap that led into the \\'Search in DCIM\\' mode. However, it returned the agent to the \\'Search folders\\' screen, from which a previous attempt to open DCIM by tapping on it (Step 28) also resulted in entering search mode rather than browsing the folder\\'s contents. Therefore, while the action correctly navigated back, it did not yet enable visual inspection of the DCIM folder\\'s contents.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.54\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [79, 171, 99, 461], \\'text\\': \\'Search folders\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [168, 7, 189, 307], \\'text\\': \\'Innovate Solutions Ltd_ Innovation and Excellence\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [199, 8, 209, 275], \\'text\\': \\'2023-01-24, Webcam, $38.40\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [299, 18, 315, 107], \\'text\\': \\'DCIM\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [330, 11, 344, 247], \\'text\\': \\'you for your purchase! Visit us at: WWW tech-gadgets com\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [273, 0, 350, 501]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 639, 114, 723]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 753, 114, 839]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 194, 39, 242]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 853, 113, 946]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [11, 818, 42, 894]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 46, 40, 188]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [12, 903, 40, 948]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The search field is currently focused and contains \\'frog\\'. This action should trigger the search, and the screen should update to show the search results. Hopefully, the target image will be displayed. Actual Outcome: The action of sending an ENTER keyevent (keycode 66) did not result in any visible change on the screen. The search text \\'frog\\' remained in the search bar, and no search results were displayed. Therefore, the image \\'receipt_2023_01_22_sure_frog.jpg\\' was not found using the partial name \\'frog\\'. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of locating the image.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,100],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, located to the left of the search text \\'frog\\' (estimated center [90, 100]). This action is intended to close the search interface and return to the DCIM folder view, allowing for a visual inspection of its contents. The search bar currently contains \\'frog\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon cleared the search text \\'frog\\' from the search bar. The search bar now displays \\'Search in DCIM\\'. The virtual keyboard is no longer visible. However, the agent is still within the search interface of the DCIM folder and has not returned to the general folder view. Therefore, the action did not fully achieve its intended outcome of closing the search interface. It did not bring the agent closer to locating the image by visual inspection, as the folder view is not visible.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a system back keyevent (keycode \\'KEYCODE_BACK\\') to close the current search interface. The current screen shows the \\'Search in DCIM\\' interface. This action is predicted to return the view to the DCIM folder, allowing for visual inspection of its contents. Actual Outcome: The system back keyevent successfully navigated from the \\'Search in DCIM\\' interface to a \\'Search folders\\' interface where the \\'DCIM\\' folder is now visible as a selectable item. This brings the agent closer to visually inspecting the DCIM folder\\'s contents.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[247,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'DCIM\\' folder item, which is visible on the screen. The center of the DCIM folder item is approximately [247, 250]. This action is intended to open the DCIM folder, allowing for visual inspection of its contents to find the target image. The predicted outcome is that the screen will display the contents of the DCIM folder. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'DCIM\\' folder (at approximately [247, 250]) did not open the folder to display its contents. Instead, it navigated to the \\'Search in DCIM\\' interface. The search bar now reads \\'Search in DCIM\\'. This outcome was not intended, as the goal was to visually inspect the folder. The action did not bring the agent closer to locating the image by visual inspection, as the folder contents are not visible.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a system back keyevent (keycode \\'KEYCODE_BACK\\') to attempt to exit the current \\'Search in DCIM\\' interface. The current screen shows \\'Search in DCIM\\'. The predicted outcome is that this action will navigate to a previous screen, hopefully allowing access to the DCIM folder\\'s contents directly, or at least to a higher-level folder view. Actual Outcome: The action of sending a system back keyevent (`KEYCODE_BACK`) successfully navigated from the \\'Search in DCIM\\' interface to the \\'Search folders\\' interface. The \\'DCIM\\' folder is now visible as a selectable item. This action effectively undid the previous tap that led into the \\'Search in DCIM\\' mode. However, it returned the agent to the \\'Search folders\\' screen, from which a previous attempt to open DCIM by tapping on it (Step 28) also resulted in entering search mode rather than browsing the folder\\'s contents. Therefore, while the action correctly navigated back, it did not yet enable visual inspection of the DCIM folder\\'s contents.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 30: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a system back keyevent (keycode \\'KEYCODE_BACK\\') to attempt to exit the current \\'Search folders\\' interface. The current screen shows \\'Search folders\\'. The predicted outcome is that this action will navigate to a previous screen, ideally the main gallery screen where folders can be browsed, allowing for a different approach to opening the DCIM folder. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open \\'Gallery\\' (Simple Gallery Pro) app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'Gallery\\' app is open and its main screen is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,100],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, located to the left of the search text \\'frog\\' (estimated center [90, 100]). This action is intended to close the search interface and return to the DCIM folder view, allowing for a visual inspection of its contents. The search bar currently contains \\'frog\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon cleared the search text \\'frog\\' from the search bar. The search bar now displays \\'Search in DCIM\\'. The virtual keyboard is no longer visible. However, the agent is still within the search interface of the DCIM folder and has not returned to the general folder view. Therefore, the action did not fully achieve its intended outcome of closing the search interface. It did not bring the agent closer to locating the image by visual inspection, as the folder view is not visible.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a system back keyevent (keycode \\'KEYCODE_BACK\\') to close the current search interface. The current screen shows the \\'Search in DCIM\\' interface. This action is predicted to return the view to the DCIM folder, allowing for visual inspection of its contents. Actual Outcome: The system back keyevent successfully navigated from the \\'Search in DCIM\\' interface to a \\'Search folders\\' interface where the \\'DCIM\\' folder is now visible as a selectable item. This brings the agent closer to visually inspecting the DCIM folder\\'s contents.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[247,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'DCIM\\' folder item, which is visible on the screen. The center of the DCIM folder item is approximately [247, 250]. This action is intended to open the DCIM folder, allowing for visual inspection of its contents to find the target image. The predicted outcome is that the screen will display the contents of the DCIM folder. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'DCIM\\' folder (at approximately [247, 250]) did not open the folder to display its contents. Instead, it navigated to the \\'Search in DCIM\\' interface. The search bar now reads \\'Search in DCIM\\'. This outcome was not intended, as the goal was to visually inspect the folder. The action did not bring the agent closer to locating the image by visual inspection, as the folder contents are not visible.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a system back keyevent (keycode \\'KEYCODE_BACK\\') to attempt to exit the current \\'Search in DCIM\\' interface. The current screen shows \\'Search in DCIM\\'. The predicted outcome is that this action will navigate to a previous screen, hopefully allowing access to the DCIM folder\\'s contents directly, or at least to a higher-level folder view. Actual Outcome: The action of sending a system back keyevent (`KEYCODE_BACK`) successfully navigated from the \\'Search in DCIM\\' interface to the \\'Search folders\\' interface. The \\'DCIM\\' folder is now visible as a selectable item. This action effectively undid the previous tap that led into the \\'Search in DCIM\\' mode. However, it returned the agent to the \\'Search folders\\' screen, from which a previous attempt to open DCIM by tapping on it (Step 28) also resulted in entering search mode rather than browsing the folder\\'s contents. Therefore, while the action correctly navigated back, it did not yet enable visual inspection of the DCIM folder\\'s contents.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a system back keyevent (keycode \\'KEYCODE_BACK\\') to attempt to exit the current \\'Search folders\\' interface. The current screen shows \\'Search folders\\'. The predicted outcome is that this action will navigate to a previous screen, ideally the main gallery screen where folders can be browsed, allowing for a different approach to opening the DCIM folder. Actual Outcome: The action of sending a system back keyevent (`KEYCODE_BACK`) from the \\'Search folders\\' interface caused the \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' app to close. The device returned to the app drawer. This was not the intended outcome, as the goal was to navigate to a higher-level view within the app. The action moved the agent further from completing the subgoal, as the app now needs to be reopened.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",
