Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [123, 46, 147, 306], \\'text\\': \\'Sun; Oct 15\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 336, 722, 431], \\'text\\': \\'Gmail\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 561, 722, 676], \\'text\\': \\'Photos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [704, 781, 722, 921], \\'text\\': \\'YouTube\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [775, 295, 872, 709], \\'text\\': \\'0 (9\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 72, 855, 232]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [788, 765, 856, 928]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 535, 858, 706]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 299, 856, 466]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [628, 536, 729, 694]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 765, 729, 927]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 300, 730, 463]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [900, 701, 947, 795]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [893, 801, 952, 924]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is taken because the Retro Music app is not visible on the home screen, and opening the app drawer is the standard way to find and launch apps. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen now displays a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Retro Music app, as the app drawer is the place to find and launch apps not on the home screen.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is taken because the Retro Music app is not visible on the home screen, and opening the app drawer is the standard way to find and launch apps. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen now displays a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Retro Music app, as the app drawer is the place to find and launch apps not on the home screen.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 1: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the lower-middle part of the screen (from [800, 500] to [200, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is taken because the Retro Music app is not visible on the home screen, and opening the app drawer is the standard way to find and launch apps. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen now displays a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Retro Music app, as the app drawer is the place to find and launch apps not on the home screen.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the lower-middle part of the screen (from [800, 500] to [200, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. This is done to reveal more apps, hoping to find \\'Retro Music\\'. The current screen shows a list of apps, but \\'Retro Music\\' is not among them.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is taken because the Retro Music app is not visible on the home screen, and opening the app drawer is the standard way to find and launch apps. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen now displays a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Retro Music app, as the app drawer is the place to find and launch apps not on the home screen.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the lower-middle part of the screen (from [800, 500] to [200, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. This is done to reveal more apps, hoping to find \\'Retro Music\\'. The current screen shows a list of apps, but \\'Retro Music\\' is not among them. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, revealing more applications. The \\'Retro Music\\' application is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Retro Music app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[649,608],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Retro Music\\' app icon, which is a cassette tape icon located at approximately [649, 608]. This action is intended to launch the Retro Music application. The icon is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Retro Music\\' app icon successfully launched the application. The app opened to the \\'Songs\\' screen, as indicated by the title \\'Songs\\' at the top and the selected \\'Songs\\' tab in the bottom navigation bar. This action completed the first subgoal and brought the agent closer to the overall user instruction. The next step is to navigate to the playlists section to create a new playlist.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then export the playlist to the Downloads directory on the device.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 4 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (from [900, 500] to [100, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is taken because the Retro Music app is not visible on the home screen, and opening the app drawer is the standard way to find and launch apps. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen now displays a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Retro Music app, as the app drawer is the place to find and launch apps not on the home screen.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the lower-middle part of the screen (from [800, 500] to [200, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. This is done to reveal more apps, hoping to find \\'Retro Music\\'. The current screen shows a list of apps, but \\'Retro Music\\' is not among them. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, revealing more applications. The \\'Retro Music\\' application is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Retro Music app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[649,608],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Retro Music\\' app icon, which is a cassette tape icon located at approximately [649, 608]. This action is intended to launch the Retro Music application. The icon is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Retro Music\\' app icon successfully launched the application. The app opened to the \\'Songs\\' screen, as indicated by the title \\'Songs\\' at the top and the selected \\'Songs\\' tab in the bottom navigation bar. This action completed the first subgoal and brought the agent closer to the overall user instruction. The next step is to navigate to the playlists section to create a new playlist.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[934,699],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' icon (two musical notes) in the bottom navigation bar. This icon is located at approximately [934, 699] (center of the icon with bounding box [906, 630, 963, 769]). This action is expected to navigate to the playlists screen, where a new playlist can be created. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on an icon at [934, 699] (believed to be the \\'Playlists\\' icon), failed. The screen did not change from the \\'Songs\\' view. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To correct this, the next action will be to tap the hamburger menu icon at the bottom right of the screen to find the \\'Playlists\\' section.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 4: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[933,896],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon (three horizontal lines) located at the bottom right of the screen, at approximately [933, 896]. This icon is currently not selected. This action is expected to open a menu or navigate to a screen where the \\'Playlists\\' option can be found. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Retro Music App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Retro Music app is open and its main interface is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Retro Music app, as the app drawer is the place to find and launch apps not on the home screen.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the lower-middle part of the screen (from [800, 500] to [200, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. This is done to reveal more apps, hoping to find \\'Retro Music\\'. The current screen shows a list of apps, but \\'Retro Music\\' is not among them. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, revealing more applications. The \\'Retro Music\\' application is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Retro Music app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[649,608],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Retro Music\\' app icon, which is a cassette tape icon located at approximately [649, 608]. This action is intended to launch the Retro Music application. The icon is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Retro Music\\' app icon successfully launched the application. The app opened to the \\'Songs\\' screen, as indicated by the title \\'Songs\\' at the top and the selected \\'Songs\\' tab in the bottom navigation bar. This action completed the first subgoal and brought the agent closer to the overall user instruction. The next step is to navigate to the playlists section to create a new playlist.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[934,699],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' icon (two musical notes) in the bottom navigation bar. This icon is located at approximately [934, 699] (center of the icon with bounding box [906, 630, 963, 769]). This action is expected to navigate to the playlists screen, where a new playlist can be created. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on an icon at [934, 699] (believed to be the \\'Playlists\\' icon), failed. The screen did not change from the \\'Songs\\' view. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To correct this, the next action will be to tap the hamburger menu icon at the bottom right of the screen to find the \\'Playlists\\' section.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[933,896],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon (three horizontal lines) located at the bottom right of the screen, at approximately [933, 896]. This icon is currently not selected. This action is expected to open a menu or navigate to a screen where the \\'Playlists\\' option can be found. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [933, 896] successfully navigated the app from the \\'Songs\\' screen to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. The title changed to \\'Playlists\\', and the content area now indicates that there are no playlists. This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating a new playlist.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.38\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [76, 397, 107, 609], \\'text\\': \\'Playlists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [545, 222, 577, 779], \\'text\\': \\'You have no playlists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [945, 837, 962, 967], \\'text\\': \\'Playlists\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [900, 806, 971, 995]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [907, 243, 957, 359]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [904, 643, 968, 763]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [908, 47, 957, 153]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [907, 445, 959, 558]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 197, 39, 242]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 917, 109, 978]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [75, 394, 107, 607]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Retro Music\\' app icon successfully launched the application. The app opened to the \\'Songs\\' screen, as indicated by the title \\'Songs\\' at the top and the selected \\'Songs\\' tab in the bottom navigation bar. This action completed the first subgoal and brought the agent closer to the overall user instruction. The next step is to navigate to the playlists section to create a new playlist.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[934,699],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' icon (two musical notes) in the bottom navigation bar. This icon is located at approximately [934, 699] (center of the icon with bounding box [906, 630, 963, 769]). This action is expected to navigate to the playlists screen, where a new playlist can be created. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on an icon at [934, 699] (believed to be the \\'Playlists\\' icon), failed. The screen did not change from the \\'Songs\\' view. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To correct this, the next action will be to tap the hamburger menu icon at the bottom right of the screen to find the \\'Playlists\\' section.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[933,896],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon (three horizontal lines) located at the bottom right of the screen, at approximately [933, 896]. This icon is currently not selected. This action is expected to open a menu or navigate to a screen where the \\'Playlists\\' option can be found. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [933, 896] successfully navigated the app from the \\'Songs\\' screen to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. The title changed to \\'Playlists\\', and the content area now indicates that there are no playlists. This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating a new playlist.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 5: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is done to reveal more apps, hoping to find \\'Retro Music\\'. The current screen shows a list of apps, but \\'Retro Music\\' is not among them. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, revealing more applications. The \\'Retro Music\\' application is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Retro Music app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[649,608],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Retro Music\\' app icon, which is a cassette tape icon located at approximately [649, 608]. This action is intended to launch the Retro Music application. The icon is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Retro Music\\' app icon successfully launched the application. The app opened to the \\'Songs\\' screen, as indicated by the title \\'Songs\\' at the top and the selected \\'Songs\\' tab in the bottom navigation bar. This action completed the first subgoal and brought the agent closer to the overall user instruction. The next step is to navigate to the playlists section to create a new playlist.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[934,699],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' icon (two musical notes) in the bottom navigation bar. This icon is located at approximately [934, 699] (center of the icon with bounding box [906, 630, 963, 769]). This action is expected to navigate to the playlists screen, where a new playlist can be created. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on an icon at [934, 699] (believed to be the \\'Playlists\\' icon), failed. The screen did not change from the \\'Songs\\' view. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To correct this, the next action will be to tap the hamburger menu icon at the bottom right of the screen to find the \\'Playlists\\' section.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[933,896],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon (three horizontal lines) located at the bottom right of the screen, at approximately [933, 896]. This icon is currently not selected. This action is expected to open a menu or navigate to a screen where the \\'Playlists\\' option can be found. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [933, 896] successfully navigated the app from the \\'Songs\\' screen to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. The title changed to \\'Playlists\\', and the content area now indicates that there are no playlists. This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating a new playlist.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,947],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen, at approximately [90, 947]. This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a menu containing options related to playlists, including an option to create a new playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dot menu icon (predicted at [90, 947]) was successful. A pop-up menu appeared on the screen, displaying options: \\'Grid size\\', \\'Sort order\\', \\'New playlist\\', \\'Import playlist\\', and \\'Settings\\'. This action directly advances the current subgoal of creating a new playlist, as the \\'New playlist\\' option is now accessible.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.38\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [75, 394, 108, 717], \\'text\\': \\'Playl Grid size\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [143, 551, 161, 741], \\'text\\': \\'Sort order\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [195, 552, 218, 785], \\'text\\': \\'New playlist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [248, 550, 270, 825], \\'text\\': \\'Import playlist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [300, 548, 322, 709], \\'text\\': \\'Settings\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [545, 222, 577, 779], \\'text\\': \\'You have no playlists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [945, 837, 962, 967], \\'text\\': \\'Playlists\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [899, 803, 970, 995]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [126, 504, 180, 989]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [907, 242, 957, 359]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [908, 46, 956, 153]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [905, 643, 967, 764]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [74, 509, 127, 989]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [908, 445, 957, 558]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [179, 505, 232, 993]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [232, 509, 284, 990]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 194, 38, 244]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then export the playlist to the Downloads directory on the device.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the lower-middle part of the screen (from [800, 500] to [200, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. This is done to reveal more apps, hoping to find \\'Retro Music\\'. The current screen shows a list of apps, but \\'Retro Music\\' is not among them. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, revealing more applications. The \\'Retro Music\\' application is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Retro Music app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[649,608],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Retro Music\\' app icon, which is a cassette tape icon located at approximately [649, 608]. This action is intended to launch the Retro Music application. The icon is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Retro Music\\' app icon successfully launched the application. The app opened to the \\'Songs\\' screen, as indicated by the title \\'Songs\\' at the top and the selected \\'Songs\\' tab in the bottom navigation bar. This action completed the first subgoal and brought the agent closer to the overall user instruction. The next step is to navigate to the playlists section to create a new playlist.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[934,699],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' icon (two musical notes) in the bottom navigation bar. This icon is located at approximately [934, 699] (center of the icon with bounding box [906, 630, 963, 769]). This action is expected to navigate to the playlists screen, where a new playlist can be created. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on an icon at [934, 699] (believed to be the \\'Playlists\\' icon), failed. The screen did not change from the \\'Songs\\' view. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To correct this, the next action will be to tap the hamburger menu icon at the bottom right of the screen to find the \\'Playlists\\' section.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[933,896],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon (three horizontal lines) located at the bottom right of the screen, at approximately [933, 896]. This icon is currently not selected. This action is expected to open a menu or navigate to a screen where the \\'Playlists\\' option can be found. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [933, 896] successfully navigated the app from the \\'Songs\\' screen to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. The title changed to \\'Playlists\\', and the content area now indicates that there are no playlists. This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating a new playlist.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,947],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen, at approximately [90, 947]. This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a menu containing options related to playlists, including an option to create a new playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dot menu icon (predicted at [90, 947]) was successful. A pop-up menu appeared on the screen, displaying options: \\'Grid size\\', \\'Sort order\\', \\'New playlist\\', \\'Import playlist\\', and \\'Settings\\'. This action directly advances the current subgoal of creating a new playlist, as the \\'New playlist\\' option is now accessible.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 6: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[649,608],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Retro Music\\' app icon, which is a cassette tape icon located at approximately [649, 608]. This action is intended to launch the Retro Music application. The icon is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Retro Music\\' app icon successfully launched the application. The app opened to the \\'Songs\\' screen, as indicated by the title \\'Songs\\' at the top and the selected \\'Songs\\' tab in the bottom navigation bar. This action completed the first subgoal and brought the agent closer to the overall user instruction. The next step is to navigate to the playlists section to create a new playlist.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[934,699],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' icon (two musical notes) in the bottom navigation bar. This icon is located at approximately [934, 699] (center of the icon with bounding box [906, 630, 963, 769]). This action is expected to navigate to the playlists screen, where a new playlist can be created. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on an icon at [934, 699] (believed to be the \\'Playlists\\' icon), failed. The screen did not change from the \\'Songs\\' view. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To correct this, the next action will be to tap the hamburger menu icon at the bottom right of the screen to find the \\'Playlists\\' section.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[933,896],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon (three horizontal lines) located at the bottom right of the screen, at approximately [933, 896]. This icon is currently not selected. This action is expected to open a menu or navigate to a screen where the \\'Playlists\\' option can be found. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [933, 896] successfully navigated the app from the \\'Songs\\' screen to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. The title changed to \\'Playlists\\', and the content area now indicates that there are no playlists. This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating a new playlist.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,947],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen, at approximately [90, 947]. This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a menu containing options related to playlists, including an option to create a new playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dot menu icon (predicted at [90, 947]) was successful. A pop-up menu appeared on the screen, displaying options: \\'Grid size\\', \\'Sort order\\', \\'New playlist\\', \\'Import playlist\\', and \\'Settings\\'. This action directly advances the current subgoal of creating a new playlist, as the \\'New playlist\\' option is now accessible.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[206,668],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'New playlist\\' option in the menu. The \\'New playlist\\' text is located at approximately [206, 668]. This action is expected to open a dialog or screen where the new playlist can be named. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'New playlist\\' was successful. A \\'New playlist\\' dialog box appeared, prompting for the playlist name. This dialog includes a text field labeled \\'Playlist name\\' and \\'Cancel\\' and \\'Create\\' buttons. This action brings the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of creating a new playlist, as the interface for naming the playlist is now active.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.39\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 65, 948], \\'text\\': \\'Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [76, 397, 107, 609], \\'text\\': \\'Playlists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [420, 140, 453, 465], \\'text\\': \\'New playlist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [494, 158, 513, 370], \\'text\\': \\'Playlist name\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [583, 537, 598, 650], \\'text\\': \\'Cancel\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [582, 724, 598, 832], \\'text\\': \\'Create\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [945, 837, 962, 967], \\'text\\': \\'Playlists\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [475, 112, 534, 885]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [899, 804, 970, 995]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [904, 640, 971, 767]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [567, 685, 616, 874]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [908, 54, 958, 145]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [566, 498, 617, 689]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [897, 368, 989, 635]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [906, 238, 960, 364]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then export the playlist to the Downloads directory on the device.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[649,608],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Retro Music\\' app icon, which is a cassette tape icon located at approximately [649, 608]. This action is intended to launch the Retro Music application. The icon is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Retro Music\\' app icon successfully launched the application. The app opened to the \\'Songs\\' screen, as indicated by the title \\'Songs\\' at the top and the selected \\'Songs\\' tab in the bottom navigation bar. This action completed the first subgoal and brought the agent closer to the overall user instruction. The next step is to navigate to the playlists section to create a new playlist.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[934,699],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' icon (two musical notes) in the bottom navigation bar. This icon is located at approximately [934, 699] (center of the icon with bounding box [906, 630, 963, 769]). This action is expected to navigate to the playlists screen, where a new playlist can be created. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on an icon at [934, 699] (believed to be the \\'Playlists\\' icon), failed. The screen did not change from the \\'Songs\\' view. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To correct this, the next action will be to tap the hamburger menu icon at the bottom right of the screen to find the \\'Playlists\\' section.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[933,896],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon (three horizontal lines) located at the bottom right of the screen, at approximately [933, 896]. This icon is currently not selected. This action is expected to open a menu or navigate to a screen where the \\'Playlists\\' option can be found. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [933, 896] successfully navigated the app from the \\'Songs\\' screen to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. The title changed to \\'Playlists\\', and the content area now indicates that there are no playlists. This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating a new playlist.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,947],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen, at approximately [90, 947]. This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a menu containing options related to playlists, including an option to create a new playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dot menu icon (predicted at [90, 947]) was successful. A pop-up menu appeared on the screen, displaying options: \\'Grid size\\', \\'Sort order\\', \\'New playlist\\', \\'Import playlist\\', and \\'Settings\\'.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This icon is located at approximately [934, 699] (center of the icon with bounding box [906, 630, 963, 769]). This action is expected to navigate to the playlists screen, where a new playlist can be created. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on an icon at [934, 699] (believed to be the \\'Playlists\\' icon), failed. The screen did not change from the \\'Songs\\' view. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To correct this, the next action will be to tap the hamburger menu icon at the bottom right of the screen to find the \\'Playlists\\' section.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[933,896],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon (three horizontal lines) located at the bottom right of the screen, at approximately [933, 896]. This icon is currently not selected. This action is expected to open a menu or navigate to a screen where the \\'Playlists\\' option can be found. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [933, 896] successfully navigated the app from the \\'Songs\\' screen to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. The title changed to \\'Playlists\\', and the content area now indicates that there are no playlists. This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating a new playlist.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,947],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen, at approximately [90, 947]. This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a menu containing options related to playlists, including an option to create a new playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dot menu icon (predicted at [90, 947]) was successful. A pop-up menu appeared on the screen, displaying options: \\'Grid size\\', \\'Sort order\\', \\'New playlist\\', \\'Import playlist\\', and \\'Settings\\'. This action directly advances the current subgoal of creating a new playlist, as the \\'New playlist\\' option is now accessible.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[206,668],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'New playlist\\' option in the menu. The \\'New playlist\\' text is located at approximately [206, 668]. This action is expected to open a dialog or screen where the new playlist can be named. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'New playlist\\' was successful. A \\'New playlist\\' dialog box appeared, prompting for the playlist name. This dialog includes a text field labeled \\'Playlist name\\' and \\'Cancel\\' and \\'Create\\' buttons. This action brings the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of creating a new playlist, as the interface for naming the playlist is now active.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[504,498],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text input field labeled \\'Playlist name\\' (center approx. [504, 498]) within the \\'New playlist\\' dialog. This action is intended to focus the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing text input for the playlist name. The text field currently shows \\'Playlist name\\' as placeholder text. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Playlist name\\' text field (approx. [504, 498]) was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, allowing for text input. This action directly advances the current subgoal of creating a new playlist.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.39\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [76, 397, 107, 609], \\'text\\': \\'Playlists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [397, 140, 430, 466], \\'text\\': \\'New playlist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [444, 159, 462, 352], \\'text\\': \\'Playlist name\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [558, 537, 574, 650], \\'text\\': \\'Cancel\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [558, 724, 575, 832], \\'text\\': \\'Create\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [451, 113, 510, 887]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [544, 684, 592, 876]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [899, 819, 935, 981]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [543, 498, 594, 689]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [75, 921, 103, 974]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"1\", text=\"Playlist name\", resource-id=\"code.name.monkey.retromusic:id/actionNewPlaylist\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"code.name.monkey.retromusic\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[133,1081][947,1216]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"Playlist name\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then export the playlist to the Downloads directory on the device.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[934,699],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' icon (two musical notes) in the bottom navigation bar. This icon is located at approximately [934, 699] (center of the icon with bounding box [906, 630, 963, 769]). This action is expected to navigate to the playlists screen, where a new playlist can be created. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on an icon at [934, 699] (believed to be the \\'Playlists\\' icon), failed. The screen did not change from the \\'Songs\\' view. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To correct this, the next action will be to tap the hamburger menu icon at the bottom right of the screen to find the \\'Playlists\\' section.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[933,896],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon (three horizontal lines) located at the bottom right of the screen, at approximately [933, 896]. This icon is currently not selected. This action is expected to open a menu or navigate to a screen where the \\'Playlists\\' option can be found. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [933, 896] successfully navigated the app from the \\'Songs\\' screen to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. The title changed to \\'Playlists\\', and the content area now indicates that there are no playlists. This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating a new playlist.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a menu containing options related to playlists, including an option to create a new playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dot menu icon (predicted at [90, 947]) was successful. A pop-up menu appeared on the screen, displaying options: \\'Grid size\\', \\'Sort order\\', \\'New playlist\\', \\'Import playlist\\', and \\'Settings\\'. This action directly advances the current subgoal of creating a new playlist, as the \\'New playlist\\' option is now accessible.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'New playlist\\' was successful. A \\'New playlist\\' dialog box appeared, prompting for the playlist name. This dialog includes a text field labeled \\'Playlist name\\' and \\'Cancel\\' and \\'Create\\' buttons. This action brings the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of creating a new playlist, as the interface for naming the playlist is now active.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[504,498],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text input field labeled \\'Playlist name\\' (center approx. [504, 498]) within the \\'New playlist\\' dialog. This action is intended to focus the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing text input for the playlist name. The text field currently shows \\'Playlist name\\' as placeholder text. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Playlist name\\' text field (approx. [504, 498]) was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, allowing for text input. This action directly advances the current subgoal of creating a new playlist.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 8: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Blues Break 567\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Blues Break 567\\' into the focused \\'Playlist name\\' text field. The text field currently contains placeholder text \\'Playlist name\\'. After this action, the text field should contain \\'Blues Break 567\\'.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This icon is currently not selected. This action is expected to open a menu or navigate to a screen where the \\'Playlists\\' option can be found. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [933, 896] successfully navigated the app from the \\'Songs\\' screen to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. The title changed to \\'Playlists\\', and the content area now indicates that there are no playlists. This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating a new playlist.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,947],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen, at approximately [90, 947]. This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a menu containing options related to playlists, including an option to create a new playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dot menu icon (predicted at [90, 947]) was successful. A pop-up menu appeared on the screen, displaying options: \\'Grid size\\', \\'Sort order\\', \\'New playlist\\', \\'Import playlist\\', and \\'Settings\\'. This action directly advances the current subgoal of creating a new playlist, as the \\'New playlist\\' option is now accessible.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[206,668],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'New playlist\\' option in the menu. The \\'New playlist\\' text is located at approximately [206, 668]. This action is expected to open a dialog or screen where the new playlist can be named. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'New playlist\\' was successful. A \\'New playlist\\' dialog box appeared, prompting for the playlist name. This dialog includes a text field labeled \\'Playlist name\\' and \\'Cancel\\' and \\'Create\\' buttons. This action brings the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of creating a new playlist, as the interface for naming the playlist is now active.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[504,498],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text input field labeled \\'Playlist name\\' (center approx. [504, 498]) within the \\'New playlist\\' dialog. This action is intended to focus the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing text input for the playlist name. The text field currently shows \\'Playlist name\\' as placeholder text. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Playlist name\\' text field (approx. [504, 498]) was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, allowing for text input. This action directly advances the current subgoal of creating a new playlist.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Blues Break 567\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Blues Break 567\\' into the focused \\'Playlist name\\' text field. The text field currently contains placeholder text \\'Playlist name\\'. After this action, the text field should contain \\'Blues Break 567\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Blues Break 567\\' into the \\'Playlist name\\' text field was successful. The text field now correctly displays \\'Blues Break 567\\'. This action directly advances the active subgoal of creating the new playlist, as the playlist name is now set.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.40\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 65, 948], \\'text\\': \\'Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [76, 397, 107, 609], \\'text\\': \\'Playlists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [397, 140, 430, 466], \\'text\\': \\'New playlist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [444, 159, 462, 352], \\'text\\': \\'Playlist name\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [469, 158, 489, 416], \\'text\\': \\'Blues Break 5671\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [558, 537, 574, 650], \\'text\\': \\'Cancel\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [558, 724, 575, 832], \\'text\\': \\'Create\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [450, 112, 510, 884]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [544, 684, 592, 876]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [899, 819, 934, 981]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [543, 495, 593, 690]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [74, 921, 104, 975]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 823, 37, 899]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"1\", text=\"Blues Break 567\", resource-id=\"code.name.monkey.retromusic:id/actionNewPlaylist\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"code.name.monkey.retromusic\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[133,1081][947,1216]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"Blues Break 567\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then export the playlist to the Downloads directory on the device.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[933,896],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon (three horizontal lines) located at the bottom right of the screen, at approximately [933, 896]. This icon is currently not selected. This action is expected to open a menu or navigate to a screen where the \\'Playlists\\' option can be found. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [933, 896] successfully navigated the app from the \\'Songs\\' screen to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. The title changed to \\'Playlists\\', and the content area now indicates that there are no playlists. This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating a new playlist.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,947],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen, at approximately [90, 947]. This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a menu containing options related to playlists, including an option to create a new playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dot menu icon (predicted at [90, 947]) was successful. A pop-up menu appeared on the screen, displaying options: \\'Grid size\\', \\'Sort order\\', \\'New playlist\\', \\'Import playlist\\', and \\'Settings\\'. This action directly advances the current subgoal of creating a new playlist, as the \\'New playlist\\' option is now accessible.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[206,668],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'New playlist\\' option in the menu. The \\'New playlist\\' text is located at approximately [206, 668]. This action is expected to open a dialog or screen where the new playlist can be named. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'New playlist\\' was successful. A \\'New playlist\\' dialog box appeared, prompting for the playlist name. This dialog includes a text field labeled \\'Playlist name\\' and \\'Cancel\\' and \\'Create\\' buttons. This action brings the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of creating a new playlist, as the interface for naming the playlist is now active.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[504,498],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text input field labeled \\'Playlist name\\' (center approx. [504, 498]) within the \\'New playlist\\' dialog. This action is intended to focus the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing text input for the playlist name.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a menu containing options related to playlists, including an option to create a new playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dot menu icon (predicted at [90, 947]) was successful. A pop-up menu appeared on the screen, displaying options: \\'Grid size\\', \\'Sort order\\', \\'New playlist\\', \\'Import playlist\\', and \\'Settings\\'. This action directly advances the current subgoal of creating a new playlist, as the \\'New playlist\\' option is now accessible.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[206,668],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'New playlist\\' option in the menu. The \\'New playlist\\' text is located at approximately [206, 668]. This action is expected to open a dialog or screen where the new playlist can be named. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'New playlist\\' was successful. A \\'New playlist\\' dialog box appeared, prompting for the playlist name. This dialog includes a text field labeled \\'Playlist name\\' and \\'Cancel\\' and \\'Create\\' buttons. This action brings the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of creating a new playlist, as the interface for naming the playlist is now active.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[504,498],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text input field labeled \\'Playlist name\\' (center approx. [504, 498]) within the \\'New playlist\\' dialog. This action is intended to focus the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing text input for the playlist name. The text field currently shows \\'Playlist name\\' as placeholder text. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Playlist name\\' text field (approx. [504, 498]) was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, allowing for text input. This action directly advances the current subgoal of creating a new playlist.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Blues Break 567\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Blues Break 567\\' into the focused \\'Playlist name\\' text field. The text field currently contains placeholder text \\'Playlist name\\'. After this action, the text field should contain \\'Blues Break 567\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Blues Break 567\\' into the \\'Playlist name\\' text field was successful. The text field now correctly displays \\'Blues Break 567\\'. This action directly advances the active subgoal of creating the new playlist, as the playlist name is now set.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[566,778],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Create\\' button (center approx. [566, 778]) in the \\'New playlist\\' dialog. This button is currently visible and enabled. This action is expected to create the new playlist with the name \\'Blues Break 567\\' and close the dialog, likely navigating to the newly created playlist\\'s view or back to the list of playlists. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Create\\' button (located at [566, 778] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'New playlist\\' dialog closed, and the playlist \\'Blues Break 567\\' was created. The app now shows the view for this playlist, which currently contains 0 songs. A toast message \\'Added 0 song(s) to Blues Break 567\\' appeared, confirming the creation of an empty playlist. This action successfully completed the creation of the playlist, bringing the agent closer to the overall user instruction.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 132], \\'text\\': \\'15.41\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [76, 397, 107, 609], \\'text\\': \\'Playlists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [192, 135, 288, 360], \\'text\\': \\'0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [358, 41, 377, 337], \\'text\\': \\'Blues Break 567\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [385, 41, 406, 302], \\'text\\': \\'0 Songs 00.00\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [889, 265, 910, 816], \\'text\\': \\'Added 0 song(s) to Blues Break 567\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [945, 837, 962, 967], \\'text\\': \\'Playlists\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [183, 126, 293, 375]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [873, 138, 925, 859]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [899, 809, 970, 982]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [909, 50, 955, 147]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [346, 9, 418, 491]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 919, 108, 977]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 195, 39, 243]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a menu containing options related to playlists, including an option to create a new playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dot menu icon (predicted at [90, 947]) was successful. A pop-up menu appeared on the screen, displaying options: \\'Grid size\\', \\'Sort order\\', \\'New playlist\\', \\'Import playlist\\', and \\'Settings\\'. This action directly advances the current subgoal of creating a new playlist, as the \\'New playlist\\' option is now accessible.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[206,668],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'New playlist\\' option in the menu. The \\'New playlist\\' text is located at approximately [206, 668]. This action is expected to open a dialog or screen where the new playlist can be named. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'New playlist\\' was successful. A \\'New playlist\\' dialog box appeared, prompting for the playlist name. This dialog includes a text field labeled \\'Playlist name\\' and \\'Cancel\\' and \\'Create\\' buttons. This action brings the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of creating a new playlist, as the interface for naming the playlist is now active.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[504,498],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text input field labeled \\'Playlist name\\' (center approx. [504, 498]) within the \\'New playlist\\' dialog. This action is intended to focus the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing text input for the playlist name. The text field currently shows \\'Playlist name\\' as placeholder text. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Playlist name\\' text field (approx. [504, 498]) was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, allowing for text input. This action directly advances the current subgoal of creating a new playlist.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Blues Break 567\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Blues Break 567\\' into the focused \\'Playlist name\\' text field. The text field currently contains placeholder text \\'Playlist name\\'. After this action, the text field should contain \\'Blues Break 567\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Blues Break 567\\' into the \\'Playlist name\\' text field was successful. The text field now correctly displays \\'Blues Break 567\\'. This action directly advances the active subgoal of creating the new playlist, as the playlist name is now set.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The \\'New playlist\\' text is located at approximately [206, 668]. This action is expected to open a dialog or screen where the new playlist can be named. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'New playlist\\' was successful. A \\'New playlist\\' dialog box appeared, prompting for the playlist name. This dialog includes a text field labeled \\'Playlist name\\' and \\'Cancel\\' and \\'Create\\' buttons. This action brings the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of creating a new playlist, as the interface for naming the playlist is now active.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[504,498],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text input field labeled \\'Playlist name\\' (center approx. [504, 498]) within the \\'New playlist\\' dialog. This action is intended to focus the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing text input for the playlist name. The text field currently shows \\'Playlist name\\' as placeholder text. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Playlist name\\' text field (approx. [504, 498]) was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, allowing for text input. This action directly advances the current subgoal of creating a new playlist.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Blues Break 567\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Blues Break 567\\' into the focused \\'Playlist name\\' text field. The text field currently contains placeholder text \\'Playlist name\\'. After this action, the text field should contain \\'Blues Break 567\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Blues Break 567\\' into the \\'Playlist name\\' text field was successful. The text field now correctly displays \\'Blues Break 567\\'. This action directly advances the active subgoal of creating the new playlist, as the playlist name is now set.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[566,778],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Create\\' button (center approx. [566, 778]) in the \\'New playlist\\' dialog. This button is currently visible and enabled. This action is expected to create the new playlist with the name \\'Blues Break 567\\' and close the dialog, likely navigating to the newly created playlist\\'s view or back to the list of playlists. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Create\\' button (located at [566, 778] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'New playlist\\' dialog closed, and the playlist \\'Blues Break 567\\' was created. The app now shows the view for this playlist, which currently contains 0 songs. A toast message \\'Added 0 song(s) to Blues Break 567\\' appeared, confirming the creation of an empty playlist. This action successfully completed the creation of the playlist, bringing the agent closer to the overall user instruction.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[367,189],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the playlist named \\'Blues Break 567\\' (center approx. [367, 189]) to open it. The playlist currently shows \\'0 Songs\\'. This action is expected to navigate to the detailed view of the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist, where options to add songs should be available. Actual Outcome: The tap on the playlist \\'Blues Break 567\\' (center approx. [367, 189] in the previous screen) was successful. The application navigated to the detailed view of the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. The screen now displays the playlist title, \\'0 Songs\\', and a message \\'You have no songs\\', indicating the playlist is empty. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding songs, as the playlist is now open and ready for songs to be added.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then export the playlist to the Downloads directory on the device.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[206,668],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'New playlist\\' option in the menu. The \\'New playlist\\' text is located at approximately [206, 668]. This action is expected to open a dialog or screen where the new playlist can be named. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'New playlist\\' was successful. A \\'New playlist\\' dialog box appeared, prompting for the playlist name. This dialog includes a text field labeled \\'Playlist name\\' and \\'Cancel\\' and \\'Create\\' buttons. This action brings the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of creating a new playlist, as the interface for naming the playlist is now active.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[504,498],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text input field labeled \\'Playlist name\\' (center approx. [504, 498]) within the \\'New playlist\\' dialog. This action is intended to focus the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing text input for the playlist name. The text field currently shows \\'Playlist name\\' as placeholder text. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Playlist name\\' text field (approx. [504, 498]) was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, allowing for text input. This action directly advances the current subgoal of creating a new playlist.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Blues Break 567\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Blues Break 567\\' into the focused \\'Playlist name\\' text field. The text field currently contains placeholder text \\'Playlist name\\'. After this action, the text field should contain \\'Blues Break 567\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Blues Break 567\\' into the \\'Playlist name\\' text field was successful. The text field now correctly displays \\'Blues Break 567\\'. This action directly advances the active subgoal of creating the new playlist, as the playlist name is now set.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[566,778],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Create\\' button (center approx. [566, 778]) in the \\'New playlist\\' dialog. This button is currently visible and enabled. This action is expected to create the new playlist with the name \\'Blues Break 567\\' and close the dialog, likely navigating to the newly created playlist\\'s view or back to the list of playlists. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Create\\' button (located at [566, 778] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'New playlist\\' dialog closed, and the playlist \\'Blues Break 567\\' was created. The app now shows the view for this playlist, which currently contains 0 songs. A toast message \\'Added 0 song(s) to Blues Break 567\\' appeared, confirming the creation of an empty playlist. This action successfully completed the creation of the playlist, bringing the agent closer to the overall user instruction.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[367,189],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the playlist named \\'Blues Break 567\\' (center approx. [367, 189]) to open it. The playlist currently shows \\'0 Songs\\'. This action is expected to navigate to the detailed view of the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist, where options to add songs should be available. Actual Outcome: The tap on the playlist \\'Blues Break 567\\' (center approx. [367, 189] in the previous screen) was successful. The application navigated to the detailed view of the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. The screen now displays the playlist title, \\'0 Songs\\', and a message \\'You have no songs\\', indicating the playlist is empty. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding songs, as the playlist is now open and ready for songs to be added.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 11: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (estimated coordinates [88, 945]). This action is expected to open a context menu with options related to the playlist, including an option to add songs. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Retro Music App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Retro Music app is open and its main interface is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The option 'Add to playlist' is likely for adding this playlist to another, or adding a currently playing song to a playlist, neither of which is the current goal. Therefore, the plan to select 'Add songs' from this menu cannot proceed. The active Subgoal 3 (Add Songs) is still in progress. The immediate next step should be to close this unhelpful menu. Tapping the back arrow icon, visible at the top left (approx. [77, 66]), will close the menu and return to the playlist screen.

[504, 498]) within the \\'New playlist\\' dialog. This action is intended to focus the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing text input for the playlist name. The text field currently shows \\'Playlist name\\' as placeholder text. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Playlist name\\' text field (approx. [504, 498]) was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, allowing for text input. This action directly advances the current subgoal of creating a new playlist.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Blues Break 567\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Blues Break 567\\' into the focused \\'Playlist name\\' text field. The text field currently contains placeholder text \\'Playlist name\\'. After this action, the text field should contain \\'Blues Break 567\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Blues Break 567\\' into the \\'Playlist name\\' text field was successful. The text field now correctly displays \\'Blues Break 567\\'. This action directly advances the active subgoal of creating the new playlist, as the playlist name is now set.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[566,778],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Create\\' button (center approx. [566, 778]) in the \\'New playlist\\' dialog. This button is currently visible and enabled. This action is expected to create the new playlist with the name \\'Blues Break 567\\' and close the dialog, likely navigating to the newly created playlist\\'s view or back to the list of playlists. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Create\\' button (located at [566, 778] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'New playlist\\' dialog closed, and the playlist \\'Blues Break 567\\' was created. The app now shows the view for this playlist, which currently contains 0 songs. A toast message \\'Added 0 song(s) to Blues Break 567\\' appeared, confirming the creation of an empty playlist. This action successfully completed the creation of the playlist, bringing the agent closer to the overall user instruction.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[367,189],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the playlist named \\'Blues Break 567\\' (center approx. [367, 189]) to open it. The playlist currently shows \\'0 Songs\\'. This action is expected to navigate to the detailed view of the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist, where options to add songs should be available. Actual Outcome: The tap on the playlist \\'Blues Break 567\\' (center approx. [367, 189] in the previous screen) was successful. The application navigated to the detailed view of the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. The screen now displays the playlist title, \\'0 Songs\\', and a message \\'You have no songs\\', indicating the playlist is empty. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding songs, as the playlist is now open and ready for songs to be added.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (estimated coordinates [88, 945]). This action is expected to open a context menu with options related to the playlist, including an option to add songs. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot menu icon (located near the top right) was successful, and a context menu appeared on the right side of the screen. The menu options are: \\'Play\\', \\'Play next\\', \\'Add to playing queue\\', \\'Add to playlist\\', \\'Rename\\', \\'Delete\\', and \\'Save as file\\'. Crucially, the expected \\'Add songs\\' option is not present in this menu. This means that while the action of opening the menu was technically successful, it did not bring the agent closer to adding songs to the playlist via this menu. The agent needs to close this menu and find an alternative method to add songs.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.43\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [134, 431, 169, 725], \\'text\\': \\'BI Play next\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [183, 433, 220, 946], \\'text\\': \\'56 Add to playing queue\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [247, 429, 271, 825], \\'text\\': \\'0 Son Add to playlist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [301, 551, 318, 704], \\'text\\': \\'Rename\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [353, 551, 371, 673], \\'text\\': \\'Delete\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [406, 551, 423, 767], \\'text\\': \\'Save as file\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [545, 250, 577, 750], \\'text\\': \\'You have no songs\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [88, 545, 113, 638], \\'text\\': \\'Play\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [163, 122, 246, 313]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [462, 425, 527, 567]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 194, 38, 244]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [127, 509, 179, 993]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then export the playlist to the Downloads directory on the device.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[504,498],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text input field labeled \\'Playlist name\\' (center approx. [504, 498]) within the \\'New playlist\\' dialog. This action is intended to focus the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing text input for the playlist name. The text field currently shows \\'Playlist name\\' as placeholder text. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Playlist name\\' text field (approx. [504, 498]) was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, allowing for text input. This action directly advances the current subgoal of creating a new playlist.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Blues Break 567\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Blues Break 567\\' into the focused \\'Playlist name\\' text field. The text field currently contains placeholder text \\'Playlist name\\'. After this action, the text field should contain \\'Blues Break 567\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Blues Break 567\\' into the \\'Playlist name\\' text field was successful. The text field now correctly displays \\'Blues Break 567\\'. This action directly advances the active subgoal of creating the new playlist, as the playlist name is now set.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[566,778],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Create\\' button (center approx. [566, 778]) in the \\'New playlist\\' dialog. This button is currently visible and enabled. This action is expected to create the new playlist with the name \\'Blues Break 567\\' and close the dialog, likely navigating to the newly created playlist\\'s view or back to the list of playlists. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Create\\' button (located at [566, 778] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'New playlist\\' dialog closed, and the playlist \\'Blues Break 567\\' was created. The app now shows the view for this playlist, which currently contains 0 songs. A toast message \\'Added 0 song(s) to Blues Break 567\\' appeared, confirming the creation of an empty playlist. This action successfully completed the creation of the playlist, bringing the agent closer to the overall user instruction.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[367,189],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the playlist named \\'Blues Break 567\\' (center approx. [367, 189]) to open it. The playlist currently shows \\'0 Songs\\'. This action is expected to navigate to the detailed view of the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist, where options to add songs should be available. Actual Outcome: The tap on the playlist \\'Blues Break 567\\' (center approx. [367, 189] in the previous screen) was successful. The application navigated to the detailed view of the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. The screen now displays the playlist title, \\'0 Songs\\', and a message \\'You have no songs\\', indicating the playlist is empty. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding songs, as the playlist is now open and ready for songs to be added.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (estimated coordinates [88, 945]). This action is expected to open a context menu with options related to the playlist, including an option to add songs. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot menu icon (located near the top right) was successful, and a context menu appeared on the right side of the screen. The menu options are: \\'Play\\', \\'Play next\\', \\'Add to playing queue\\', \\'Add to playlist\\', \\'Rename\\', \\'Delete\\', and \\'Save as file\\'. Crucially, the expected \\'Add songs\\' option is not present in this menu. This means that while the action of opening the menu was technically successful, it did not bring the agent closer to adding songs to the playlist via this menu. The agent needs to close this menu and find an alternative method to add songs.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 12: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,66],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located at the top left of the screen (approx. [88, 66]). This action is intended to close the currently open context menu and return to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist view. The context menu is currently obscuring part of the screen and does not offer the required \\'Add songs\\' functionality. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Retro Music App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Retro Music app is open and its main interface is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text field currently contains placeholder text \\'Playlist name\\'. After this action, the text field should contain \\'Blues Break 567\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Blues Break 567\\' into the \\'Playlist name\\' text field was successful. The text field now correctly displays \\'Blues Break 567\\'. This action directly advances the active subgoal of creating the new playlist, as the playlist name is now set.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[566,778],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Create\\' button (center approx. [566, 778]) in the \\'New playlist\\' dialog. This button is currently visible and enabled. This action is expected to create the new playlist with the name \\'Blues Break 567\\' and close the dialog, likely navigating to the newly created playlist\\'s view or back to the list of playlists. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Create\\' button (located at [566, 778] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'New playlist\\' dialog closed, and the playlist \\'Blues Break 567\\' was created. The app now shows the view for this playlist, which currently contains 0 songs. A toast message \\'Added 0 song(s) to Blues Break 567\\' appeared, confirming the creation of an empty playlist. This action successfully completed the creation of the playlist, bringing the agent closer to the overall user instruction.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[367,189],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the playlist named \\'Blues Break 567\\' (center approx. [367, 189]) to open it. The playlist currently shows \\'0 Songs\\'. This action is expected to navigate to the detailed view of the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist, where options to add songs should be available. Actual Outcome: The tap on the playlist \\'Blues Break 567\\' (center approx. [367, 189] in the previous screen) was successful. The application navigated to the detailed view of the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. The screen now displays the playlist title, \\'0 Songs\\', and a message \\'You have no songs\\', indicating the playlist is empty. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding songs, as the playlist is now open and ready for songs to be added.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (estimated coordinates [88, 945]). This action is expected to open a context menu with options related to the playlist, including an option to add songs. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot menu icon (located near the top right) was successful, and a context menu appeared on the right side of the screen. The menu options are: \\'Play\\', \\'Play next\\', \\'Add to playing queue\\', \\'Add to playlist\\', \\'Rename\\', \\'Delete\\', and \\'Save as file\\'. Crucially, the expected \\'Add songs\\' option is not present in this menu. This means that while the action of opening the menu was technically successful, it did not bring the agent closer to adding songs to the playlist via this menu. The agent needs to close this menu and find an alternative method to add songs.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,66],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located at the top left of the screen (approx. [88, 66]). This action is intended to close the currently open context menu and return to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist view. The context menu is currently obscuring part of the screen and does not offer the required \\'Add songs\\' functionality. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (approx. [88, 66]) was successful. The context menu that was previously open has been closed. The application is now displaying the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist screen, which currently shows \\'0 Songs\\' and \\'You have no songs\\'. This action successfully navigated back from the menu, allowing for a revised strategy to add songs. The agent is now positioned to re-attempt adding songs by interacting with the three-dot menu again, but this time selecting a different option.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.44\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 428, 172, 903], \\'text\\': \\'Blues Break\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [183, 433, 218, 580], \\'text\\': \\'567\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [247, 430, 260, 451], \\'text\\': \\'0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [244, 452, 265, 689], \\'text\\': \\'Songs 00:00\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [545, 250, 577, 750], \\'text\\': \\'You have no songs\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [285, 782, 343, 917]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [163, 123, 245, 311]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [462, 430, 524, 566]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000.

Then export the playlist to the Downloads directory on the device.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Blues Break 567\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Blues Break 567\\' into the focused \\'Playlist name\\' text field. The text field currently contains placeholder text \\'Playlist name\\'. After this action, the text field should contain \\'Blues Break 567\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Blues Break 567\\' into the \\'Playlist name\\' text field was successful. The text field now correctly displays \\'Blues Break 567\\'. This action directly advances the active subgoal of creating the new playlist, as the playlist name is now set.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[566,778],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Create\\' button (center approx. [566, 778]) in the \\'New playlist\\' dialog. This button is currently visible and enabled. This action is expected to create the new playlist with the name \\'Blues Break 567\\' and close the dialog, likely navigating to the newly created playlist\\'s view or back to the list of playlists. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Create\\' button (located at [566, 778] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'New playlist\\' dialog closed, and the playlist \\'Blues Break 567\\' was created. The app now shows the view for this playlist, which currently contains 0 songs. A toast message \\'Added 0 song(s) to Blues Break 567\\' appeared, confirming the creation of an empty playlist. This action successfully completed the creation of the playlist, bringing the agent closer to the overall user instruction.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[367,189],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the playlist named \\'Blues Break 567\\' (center approx. [367, 189]) to open it. The playlist currently shows \\'0 Songs\\'. This action is expected to navigate to the detailed view of the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist, where options to add songs should be available. Actual Outcome: The tap on the playlist \\'Blues Break 567\\' (center approx. [367, 189] in the previous screen) was successful. The application navigated to the detailed view of the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. The screen now displays the playlist title, \\'0 Songs\\', and a message \\'You have no songs\\', indicating the playlist is empty. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding songs, as the playlist is now open and ready for songs to be added.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (estimated coordinates [88, 945]). This action is expected to open a context menu with options related to the playlist, including an option to add songs. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot menu icon (located near the top right) was successful, and a context menu appeared on the right side of the screen. The menu options are: \\'Play\\', \\'Play next\\', \\'Add to playing queue\\', \\'Add to playlist\\', \\'Rename\\', \\'Delete\\', and \\'Save as file\\'. Crucially, the expected \\'Add songs\\' option is not present in this menu. This means that while the action of opening the menu was technically successful, it did not bring the agent closer to adding songs to the playlist via this menu. The agent needs to close this menu and find an alternative method to add songs.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,66],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located at the top left of the screen (approx. [88, 66]). This action is intended to close the currently open context menu and return to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist view. The context menu is currently obscuring part of the screen and does not offer the required \\'Add songs\\' functionality. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (approx. [88, 66]) was successful. The context menu that was previously open has been closed. The application is now displaying the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist screen, which currently shows \\'0 Songs\\' and \\'You have no songs\\'. This action successfully navigated back from the menu, allowing for a revised strategy to add songs. The agent is now positioned to re-attempt adding songs by interacting with the three-dot menu again, but this time selecting a different option.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 13: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approx. [88, 945]). This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to re-open the context menu, from which the \\'Add to playlist\\' option will be selected to add songs. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Retro Music App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Retro Music app is open and its main interface is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[566,778],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Create\\' button (center approx. [566, 778]) in the \\'New playlist\\' dialog. This button is currently visible and enabled. This action is expected to create the new playlist with the name \\'Blues Break 567\\' and close the dialog, likely navigating to the newly created playlist\\'s view or back to the list of playlists. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Create\\' button (located at [566, 778] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'New playlist\\' dialog closed, and the playlist \\'Blues Break 567\\' was created. The app now shows the view for this playlist, which currently contains 0 songs. A toast message \\'Added 0 song(s) to Blues Break 567\\' appeared, confirming the creation of an empty playlist. This action successfully completed the creation of the playlist, bringing the agent closer to the overall user instruction.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[367,189],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the playlist named \\'Blues Break 567\\' (center approx. [367, 189]) to open it. The playlist currently shows \\'0 Songs\\'. This action is expected to navigate to the detailed view of the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist, where options to add songs should be available. Actual Outcome: The tap on the playlist \\'Blues Break 567\\' (center approx. [367, 189] in the previous screen) was successful. The application navigated to the detailed view of the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. The screen now displays the playlist title, \\'0 Songs\\', and a message \\'You have no songs\\', indicating the playlist is empty. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding songs, as the playlist is now open and ready for songs to be added.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (estimated coordinates [88, 945]). This action is expected to open a context menu with options related to the playlist, including an option to add songs. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot menu icon (located near the top right) was successful, and a context menu appeared on the right side of the screen. The menu options are: \\'Play\\', \\'Play next\\', \\'Add to playing queue\\', \\'Add to playlist\\', \\'Rename\\', \\'Delete\\', and \\'Save as file\\'. Crucially, the expected \\'Add songs\\' option is not present in this menu. This means that while the action of opening the menu was technically successful, it did not bring the agent closer to adding songs to the playlist via this menu. The agent needs to close this menu and find an alternative method to add songs.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,66],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located at the top left of the screen (approx. [88, 66]). This action is intended to close the currently open context menu and return to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist view. The context menu is currently obscuring part of the screen and does not offer the required \\'Add songs\\' functionality. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (approx. [88, 66]) was successful. The context menu that was previously open has been closed. The application is now displaying the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist screen, which currently shows \\'0 Songs\\' and \\'You have no songs\\'. This action successfully navigated back from the menu, allowing for a revised strategy to add songs. The agent is now positioned to re-attempt adding songs by interacting with the three-dot menu again, but this time selecting a different option.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approx. [88, 945]). This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to re-open the context menu, from which the \\'Add to playlist\\' option will be selected to add songs. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot menu icon (approx. [88, 945]) was successful. A context menu appeared on the right side of the screen. The menu options are: \\'Play\\', \\'Play next\\', \\'Add to playing queue\\', \\'Add to playlist\\', \\'Rename\\', \\'Delete\\', and \\'Save as file\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the \\'Add to playlist\\' option is now visible and can be selected to proceed with adding songs.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.44\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [134, 431, 169, 725], \\'text\\': \\'BI Play next\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [183, 433, 220, 946], \\'text\\': \\'56 Add to playing queue\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [247, 429, 271, 825], \\'text\\': \\'0 Son Add to playlist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [301, 551, 318, 704], \\'text\\': \\'Rename\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [353, 551, 371, 673], \\'text\\': \\'Delete\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [406, 551, 423, 767], \\'text\\': \\'Save as file\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [545, 250, 577, 750], \\'text\\': \\'You have no songs\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [88, 545, 113, 638], \\'text\\': \\'Play\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [163, 122, 246, 312]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [462, 425, 527, 567]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 194, 38, 244]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [127, 509, 179, 994]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below.

Then export the playlist to the Downloads directory on the device.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[566,778],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Create\\' button (center approx. [566, 778]) in the \\'New playlist\\' dialog. This button is currently visible and enabled. This action is expected to create the new playlist with the name \\'Blues Break 567\\' and close the dialog, likely navigating to the newly created playlist\\'s view or back to the list of playlists. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Create\\' button (located at [566, 778] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'New playlist\\' dialog closed, and the playlist \\'Blues Break 567\\' was created. The app now shows the view for this playlist, which currently contains 0 songs. A toast message \\'Added 0 song(s) to Blues Break 567\\' appeared, confirming the creation of an empty playlist. This action successfully completed the creation of the playlist, bringing the agent closer to the overall user instruction.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[367,189],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the playlist named \\'Blues Break 567\\' (center approx. [367, 189]) to open it. The playlist currently shows \\'0 Songs\\'. This action is expected to navigate to the detailed view of the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist, where options to add songs should be available. Actual Outcome: The tap on the playlist \\'Blues Break 567\\' (center approx. [367, 189] in the previous screen) was successful. The application navigated to the detailed view of the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. The screen now displays the playlist title, \\'0 Songs\\', and a message \\'You have no songs\\', indicating the playlist is empty. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding songs, as the playlist is now open and ready for songs to be added.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (estimated coordinates [88, 945]). This action is expected to open a context menu with options related to the playlist, including an option to add songs. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot menu icon (located near the top right) was successful, and a context menu appeared on the right side of the screen. The menu options are: \\'Play\\', \\'Play next\\', \\'Add to playing queue\\', \\'Add to playlist\\', \\'Rename\\', \\'Delete\\', and \\'Save as file\\'. Crucially, the expected \\'Add songs\\' option is not present in this menu. This means that while the action of opening the menu was technically successful, it did not bring the agent closer to adding songs to the playlist via this menu. The agent needs to close this menu and find an alternative method to add songs.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,66],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located at the top left of the screen (approx. [88, 66]). This action is intended to close the currently open context menu and return to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist view. The context menu is currently obscuring part of the screen and does not offer the required \\'Add songs\\' functionality. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (approx. [88, 66]) was successful. The context menu that was previously open has been closed. The application is now displaying the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist screen, which currently shows \\'0 Songs\\' and \\'You have no songs\\'. This action successfully navigated back from the menu, allowing for a revised strategy to add songs. The agent is now positioned to re-attempt adding songs by interacting with the three-dot menu again, but this time selecting a different option.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approx. [88, 945]). This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to re-open the context menu, from which the \\'Add to playlist\\' option will be selected to add songs. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot menu icon (approx. [88, 945]) was successful. A context menu appeared on the right side of the screen. The menu options are: \\'Play\\', \\'Play next\\', \\'Add to playing queue\\', \\'Add to playlist\\', \\'Rename\\', \\'Delete\\', and \\'Save as file\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the \\'Add to playlist\\' option is now visible and can be selected to proceed with adding songs.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 14: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[259,627],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu. The text \\'Add to playlist\\' is visible with bounding box [247, 429, 271, 825]. This action is expected to open a song selection interface, allowing songs to be added to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Retro Music App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Retro Music app is open and its main interface is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[367,189],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the playlist named \\'Blues Break 567\\' (center approx. [367, 189]) to open it. The playlist currently shows \\'0 Songs\\'. This action is expected to navigate to the detailed view of the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist, where options to add songs should be available. Actual Outcome: The tap on the playlist \\'Blues Break 567\\' (center approx. [367, 189] in the previous screen) was successful. The application navigated to the detailed view of the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. The screen now displays the playlist title, \\'0 Songs\\', and a message \\'You have no songs\\', indicating the playlist is empty. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding songs, as the playlist is now open and ready for songs to be added.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (estimated coordinates [88, 945]). This action is expected to open a context menu with options related to the playlist, including an option to add songs. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot menu icon (located near the top right) was successful, and a context menu appeared on the right side of the screen. The menu options are: \\'Play\\', \\'Play next\\', \\'Add to playing queue\\', \\'Add to playlist\\', \\'Rename\\', \\'Delete\\', and \\'Save as file\\'. Crucially, the expected \\'Add songs\\' option is not present in this menu. This means that while the action of opening the menu was technically successful, it did not bring the agent closer to adding songs to the playlist via this menu. The agent needs to close this menu and find an alternative method to add songs.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,66],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located at the top left of the screen (approx. [88, 66]). This action is intended to close the currently open context menu and return to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist view. The context menu is currently obscuring part of the screen and does not offer the required \\'Add songs\\' functionality. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (approx. [88, 66]) was successful. The context menu that was previously open has been closed. The application is now displaying the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist screen, which currently shows \\'0 Songs\\' and \\'You have no songs\\'. This action successfully navigated back from the menu, allowing for a revised strategy to add songs. The agent is now positioned to re-attempt adding songs by interacting with the three-dot menu again, but this time selecting a different option.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approx. [88, 945]). This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to re-open the context menu, from which the \\'Add to playlist\\' option will be selected to add songs. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot menu icon (approx. [88, 945]) was successful. A context menu appeared on the right side of the screen. The menu options are: \\'Play\\', \\'Play next\\', \\'Add to playing queue\\', \\'Add to playlist\\', \\'Rename\\', \\'Delete\\', and \\'Save as file\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the \\'Add to playlist\\' option is now visible and can be selected to proceed with adding songs.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[259,627],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu. The text \\'Add to playlist\\' is visible with bounding box [247, 429, 271, 825]. This action is expected to open a song selection interface, allowing songs to be added to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu (coordinates [259, 627] in the previous screen) was successful in triggering an action. However, it did not lead to the expected song selection interface. Instead, a dialog titled \\'Add to playlist\\' appeared, prompting to add the *current playlist* to another playlist. This is not the functionality required to add songs *into* the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The current dialog needs to be dismissed to pursue an alternative method for adding songs.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 44, 35, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.45\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 428, 172, 903], \\'text\\': \\'Blues Break\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [183, 433, 218, 580], \\'text\\': \\'567\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [245, 430, 265, 689], \\'text\\': \\'0 Songs 00:00\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [407, 142, 441, 523], \\'text\\': \\'Add to playlist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [474, 143, 494, 340], \\'text\\': \\'New playlist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [527, 140, 542, 400], \\'text\\': \\'Blues Break 567\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [594, 720, 611, 832], \\'text\\': \\'Cancel\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [285, 782, 344, 917]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [163, 123, 245, 311]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

Then export the playlist to the Downloads directory on the device.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[367,189],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the playlist named \\'Blues Break 567\\' (center approx. [367, 189]) to open it. The playlist currently shows \\'0 Songs\\'. This action is expected to navigate to the detailed view of the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist, where options to add songs should be available. Actual Outcome: The tap on the playlist \\'Blues Break 567\\' (center approx. [367, 189] in the previous screen) was successful. The application navigated to the detailed view of the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. The screen now displays the playlist title, \\'0 Songs\\', and a message \\'You have no songs\\', indicating the playlist is empty. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding songs, as the playlist is now open and ready for songs to be added.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (estimated coordinates [88, 945]). This action is expected to open a context menu with options related to the playlist, including an option to add songs. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot menu icon (located near the top right) was successful, and a context menu appeared on the right side of the screen. The menu options are: \\'Play\\', \\'Play next\\', \\'Add to playing queue\\', \\'Add to playlist\\', \\'Rename\\', \\'Delete\\', and \\'Save as file\\'. Crucially, the expected \\'Add songs\\' option is not present in this menu. This means that while the action of opening the menu was technically successful, it did not bring the agent closer to adding songs to the playlist via this menu. The agent needs to close this menu and find an alternative method to add songs.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,66],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located at the top left of the screen (approx. [88, 66]). This action is intended to close the currently open context menu and return to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist view. The context menu is currently obscuring part of the screen and does not offer the required \\'Add songs\\' functionality. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (approx. [88, 66]) was successful. The context menu that was previously open has been closed. The application is now displaying the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist screen, which currently shows \\'0 Songs\\' and \\'You have no songs\\'. This action successfully navigated back from the menu, allowing for a revised strategy to add songs. The agent is now positioned to re-attempt adding songs by interacting with the three-dot menu again, but this time selecting a different option.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approx. [88, 945]). This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to re-open the context menu, from which the \\'Add to playlist\\' option will be selected to add songs. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot menu icon (approx. [88, 945]) was successful. A context menu appeared on the right side of the screen. The menu options are: \\'Play\\', \\'Play next\\', \\'Add to playing queue\\', \\'Add to playlist\\', \\'Rename\\', \\'Delete\\', and \\'Save as file\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the \\'Add to playlist\\' option is now visible and can be selected to proceed with adding songs.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[259,627],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu. The text \\'Add to playlist\\' is visible with bounding box [247, 429, 271, 825]. This action is expected to open a song selection interface, allowing songs to be added to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu (coordinates [259, 627] in the previous screen) was successful in triggering an action. However, it did not lead to the expected song selection interface. Instead, a dialog titled \\'Add to playlist\\' appeared, prompting to add the *current playlist* to another playlist. This is not the functionality required to add songs *into* the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The current dialog needs to be dismissed to pursue an alternative method for adding songs.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 15: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[602,776],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Cancel\\' button (text \\'Cancel\\', bounding box [594, 720, 611, 832]) to close the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog. This dialog was opened incorrectly in the previous step. Closing it will allow the agent to pursue the correct method for adding songs to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Retro Music App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Retro Music app is open and its main interface is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (estimated coordinates [88, 945]). This action is expected to open a context menu with options related to the playlist, including an option to add songs. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot menu icon (located near the top right) was successful, and a context menu appeared on the right side of the screen. The menu options are: \\'Play\\', \\'Play next\\', \\'Add to playing queue\\', \\'Add to playlist\\', \\'Rename\\', \\'Delete\\', and \\'Save as file\\'. Crucially, the expected \\'Add songs\\' option is not present in this menu. This means that while the action of opening the menu was technically successful, it did not bring the agent closer to adding songs to the playlist via this menu. The agent needs to close this menu and find an alternative method to add songs.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,66],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located at the top left of the screen (approx. [88, 66]). This action is intended to close the currently open context menu and return to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist view. The context menu is currently obscuring part of the screen and does not offer the required \\'Add songs\\' functionality. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (approx. [88, 66]) was successful. The context menu that was previously open has been closed. The application is now displaying the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist screen, which currently shows \\'0 Songs\\' and \\'You have no songs\\'. This action successfully navigated back from the menu, allowing for a revised strategy to add songs. The agent is now positioned to re-attempt adding songs by interacting with the three-dot menu again, but this time selecting a different option.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approx. [88, 945]). This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to re-open the context menu, from which the \\'Add to playlist\\' option will be selected to add songs. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot menu icon (approx. [88, 945]) was successful. A context menu appeared on the right side of the screen. The menu options are: \\'Play\\', \\'Play next\\', \\'Add to playing queue\\', \\'Add to playlist\\', \\'Rename\\', \\'Delete\\', and \\'Save as file\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the \\'Add to playlist\\' option is now visible and can be selected to proceed with adding songs.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[259,627],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu. The text \\'Add to playlist\\' is visible with bounding box [247, 429, 271, 825]. This action is expected to open a song selection interface, allowing songs to be added to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu (coordinates [259, 627] in the previous screen) was successful in triggering an action. However, it did not lead to the expected song selection interface. Instead, a dialog titled \\'Add to playlist\\' appeared, prompting to add the *current playlist* to another playlist. This is not the functionality required to add songs *into* the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The current dialog needs to be dismissed to pursue an alternative method for adding songs.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[602,776],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Cancel\\' button (text \\'Cancel\\', bounding box [594, 720, 611, 832]) to close the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog. This dialog was opened incorrectly in the previous step. Closing it will allow the agent to pursue the correct method for adding songs to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Cancel\\' button (coordinates [602, 776] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog, which was incorrectly opened, has been closed. The screen now displays the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist view, showing \\'0 Songs\\' and \\'You have no songs\\'. This action corrected the previous misstep and allows the agent to proceed with the alternative plan for adding songs. The agent is now ready to navigate back to find the songs.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.46\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 428, 172, 903], \\'text\\': \\'Blues Break\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [183, 433, 218, 580], \\'text\\': \\'567\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [247, 430, 260, 451], \\'text\\': \\'0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [244, 452, 265, 689], \\'text\\': \\'Songs 00:00\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [545, 250, 577, 750], \\'text\\': \\'You have no songs\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [285, 782, 343, 917]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [163, 123, 245, 311]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [462, 430, 524, 566]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then export the playlist to the Downloads directory on the device.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (estimated coordinates [88, 945]). This action is expected to open a context menu with options related to the playlist, including an option to add songs. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot menu icon (located near the top right) was successful, and a context menu appeared on the right side of the screen. The menu options are: \\'Play\\', \\'Play next\\', \\'Add to playing queue\\', \\'Add to playlist\\', \\'Rename\\', \\'Delete\\', and \\'Save as file\\'. Crucially, the expected \\'Add songs\\' option is not present in this menu. This means that while the action of opening the menu was technically successful, it did not bring the agent closer to adding songs to the playlist via this menu. The agent needs to close this menu and find an alternative method to add songs.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,66],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located at the top left of the screen (approx. [88, 66]). This action is intended to close the currently open context menu and return to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist view. The context menu is currently obscuring part of the screen and does not offer the required \\'Add songs\\' functionality. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (approx. [88, 66]) was successful. The context menu that was previously open has been closed. The application is now displaying the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist screen, which currently shows \\'0 Songs\\' and \\'You have no songs\\'. This action successfully navigated back from the menu, allowing for a revised strategy to add songs. The agent is now positioned to re-attempt adding songs by interacting with the three-dot menu again, but this time selecting a different option.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approx. [88, 945]). This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to re-open the context menu, from which the \\'Add to playlist\\' option will be selected to add songs. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot menu icon (approx. [88, 945]) was successful. A context menu appeared on the right side of the screen. The menu options are: \\'Play\\', \\'Play next\\', \\'Add to playing queue\\', \\'Add to playlist\\', \\'Rename\\', \\'Delete\\', and \\'Save as file\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the \\'Add to playlist\\' option is now visible and can be selected to proceed with adding songs.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[259,627],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu. The text \\'Add to playlist\\' is visible with bounding box [247, 429, 271, 825]. This action is expected to open a song selection interface, allowing songs to be added to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu (coordinates [259, 627] in the previous screen) was successful in triggering an action. However, it did not lead to the expected song selection interface. Instead, a dialog titled \\'Add to playlist\\' appeared, prompting to add the *current playlist* to another playlist. This is not the functionality required to add songs *into* the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The current dialog needs to be dismissed to pursue an alternative method for adding songs.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[602,776],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Cancel\\' button (text \\'Cancel\\', bounding box [594, 720, 611, 832]) to close the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog. This dialog was opened incorrectly in the previous step. Closing it will allow the agent to pursue the correct method for adding songs to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Cancel\\' button (coordinates [602, 776] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog, which was incorrectly opened, has been closed. The screen now displays the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist view, showing \\'0 Songs\\' and \\'You have no songs\\'. This action corrected the previous misstep and allows the agent to proceed with the alternative plan for adding songs. The agent is now ready to navigate back to find the songs.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 16: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,66],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located at the top left of the screen (approximate coordinates [88, 66]). This action is intended to navigate back from the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist view to the previous screen, which is likely the list of playlists or the main library, so that songs can be searched for and added. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Retro Music App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Retro Music app is open and its main interface is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,66],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located at the top left of the screen (approx. [88, 66]). This action is intended to close the currently open context menu and return to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist view. The context menu is currently obscuring part of the screen and does not offer the required \\'Add songs\\' functionality. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (approx. [88, 66]) was successful. The context menu that was previously open has been closed. The application is now displaying the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist screen, which currently shows \\'0 Songs\\' and \\'You have no songs\\'. This action successfully navigated back from the menu, allowing for a revised strategy to add songs. The agent is now positioned to re-attempt adding songs by interacting with the three-dot menu again, but this time selecting a different option.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approx. [88, 945]). This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to re-open the context menu, from which the \\'Add to playlist\\' option will be selected to add songs. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot menu icon (approx. [88, 945]) was successful. A context menu appeared on the right side of the screen. The menu options are: \\'Play\\', \\'Play next\\', \\'Add to playing queue\\', \\'Add to playlist\\', \\'Rename\\', \\'Delete\\', and \\'Save as file\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the \\'Add to playlist\\' option is now visible and can be selected to proceed with adding songs.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[259,627],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu. The text \\'Add to playlist\\' is visible with bounding box [247, 429, 271, 825]. This action is expected to open a song selection interface, allowing songs to be added to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu (coordinates [259, 627] in the previous screen) was successful in triggering an action. However, it did not lead to the expected song selection interface. Instead, a dialog titled \\'Add to playlist\\' appeared, prompting to add the *current playlist* to another playlist. This is not the functionality required to add songs *into* the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The current dialog needs to be dismissed to pursue an alternative method for adding songs.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[602,776],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Cancel\\' button (text \\'Cancel\\', bounding box [594, 720, 611, 832]) to close the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog. This dialog was opened incorrectly in the previous step. Closing it will allow the agent to pursue the correct method for adding songs to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Cancel\\' button (coordinates [602, 776] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog, which was incorrectly opened, has been closed. The screen now displays the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist view, showing \\'0 Songs\\' and \\'You have no songs\\'. This action corrected the previous misstep and allows the agent to proceed with the alternative plan for adding songs. The agent is now ready to navigate back to find the songs.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,66],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located at the top left of the screen (approximate coordinates [88, 66]). This action is intended to navigate back from the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist view to the previous screen, which is likely the list of playlists or the main library, so that songs can be searched for and added. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (approximate coordinates [88, 66]) was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist screen back to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal because it allows for a new approach to adding songs by first navigating to the song library.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.47\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [76, 397, 107, 609], \\'text\\': \\'Playlists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [192, 135, 288, 360], \\'text\\': \\'0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [358, 41, 377, 337], \\'text\\': \\'Blues Break 567\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [385, 41, 406, 302], \\'text\\': \\'0 Songs 00.00\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [945, 837, 962, 967], \\'text\\': \\'Playlists\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [183, 126, 293, 375]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [899, 792, 972, 995]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [905, 236, 959, 362]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [907, 50, 958, 153]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [902, 640, 972, 766]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [345, 7, 420, 491]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [906, 448, 959, 558]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 918, 109, 978]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000.

Then export the playlist to the Downloads directory on the device.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,66],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located at the top left of the screen (approx. [88, 66]). This action is intended to close the currently open context menu and return to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist view. The context menu is currently obscuring part of the screen and does not offer the required \\'Add songs\\' functionality. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (approx. [88, 66]) was successful. The context menu that was previously open has been closed. The application is now displaying the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist screen, which currently shows \\'0 Songs\\' and \\'You have no songs\\'. This action successfully navigated back from the menu, allowing for a revised strategy to add songs. The agent is now positioned to re-attempt adding songs by interacting with the three-dot menu again, but this time selecting a different option.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approx. [88, 945]). This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to re-open the context menu, from which the \\'Add to playlist\\' option will be selected to add songs. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot menu icon (approx. [88, 945]) was successful. A context menu appeared on the right side of the screen. The menu options are: \\'Play\\', \\'Play next\\', \\'Add to playing queue\\', \\'Add to playlist\\', \\'Rename\\', \\'Delete\\', and \\'Save as file\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the \\'Add to playlist\\' option is now visible and can be selected to proceed with adding songs.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[259,627],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu. The text \\'Add to playlist\\' is visible with bounding box [247, 429, 271, 825]. This action is expected to open a song selection interface, allowing songs to be added to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu (coordinates [259, 627] in the previous screen) was successful in triggering an action. However, it did not lead to the expected song selection interface. Instead, a dialog titled \\'Add to playlist\\' appeared, prompting to add the *current playlist* to another playlist. This is not the functionality required to add songs *into* the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The current dialog needs to be dismissed to pursue an alternative method for adding songs.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[602,776],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Cancel\\' button (text \\'Cancel\\', bounding box [594, 720, 611, 832]) to close the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog. This dialog was opened incorrectly in the previous step. Closing it will allow the agent to pursue the correct method for adding songs to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Cancel\\' button (coordinates [602, 776] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog, which was incorrectly opened, has been closed. The screen now displays the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist view, showing \\'0 Songs\\' and \\'You have no songs\\'. This action corrected the previous misstep and allows the agent to proceed with the alternative plan for adding songs. The agent is now ready to navigate back to find the songs.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,66],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located at the top left of the screen (approximate coordinates [88, 66]). This action is intended to navigate back from the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist view to the previous screen, which is likely the list of playlists or the main library, so that songs can be searched for and added. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (approximate coordinates [88, 66]) was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist screen back to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal because it allows for a new approach to adding songs by first navigating to the song library.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 17: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

This icon represents the \\'Songs\\' tab. This action is intended to navigate to the list of all songs in the library, which is the first step in finding and adding the required songs to the playlist. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Retro Music App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Retro Music app is open and its main interface is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approx. [88, 945]). This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to re-open the context menu, from which the \\'Add to playlist\\' option will be selected to add songs. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot menu icon (approx. [88, 945]) was successful. A context menu appeared on the right side of the screen. The menu options are: \\'Play\\', \\'Play next\\', \\'Add to playing queue\\', \\'Add to playlist\\', \\'Rename\\', \\'Delete\\', and \\'Save as file\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the \\'Add to playlist\\' option is now visible and can be selected to proceed with adding songs.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[259,627],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu. The text \\'Add to playlist\\' is visible with bounding box [247, 429, 271, 825]. This action is expected to open a song selection interface, allowing songs to be added to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu (coordinates [259, 627] in the previous screen) was successful in triggering an action. However, it did not lead to the expected song selection interface. Instead, a dialog titled \\'Add to playlist\\' appeared, prompting to add the *current playlist* to another playlist. This is not the functionality required to add songs *into* the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The current dialog needs to be dismissed to pursue an alternative method for adding songs.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[602,776],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Cancel\\' button (text \\'Cancel\\', bounding box [594, 720, 611, 832]) to close the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog. This dialog was opened incorrectly in the previous step. Closing it will allow the agent to pursue the correct method for adding songs to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Cancel\\' button (coordinates [602, 776] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog, which was incorrectly opened, has been closed. The screen now displays the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist view, showing \\'0 Songs\\' and \\'You have no songs\\'. This action corrected the previous misstep and allows the agent to proceed with the alternative plan for adding songs. The agent is now ready to navigate back to find the songs.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,66],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located at the top left of the screen (approximate coordinates [88, 66]). This action is intended to navigate back from the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist view to the previous screen, which is likely the list of playlists or the main library, so that songs can be searched for and added. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (approximate coordinates [88, 66]) was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist screen back to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal because it allows for a new approach to adding songs by first navigating to the song library.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

This icon represents the \\'Songs\\' tab. This action is intended to navigate to the list of all songs in the library, which is the first step in finding and adding the required songs to the playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Songs\\' tab icon (approximate center [932, 300]) was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Songs\\' screen. The \\'Songs\\' screen now displays a list of all available songs. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal because it allows the agent to search for and select songs to add to the playlist.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"Search\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nCreate a playlist in Retro Music titled \"Blues Break 567\" with the following songs, in order: Chasing Shadows, Lost in the Echo, Twilight Calling. Then export the playlist to the Downloads directory on the device.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approx. [88, 945]). This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to re-open the context menu, from which the \\'Add to playlist\\' option will be selected to add songs. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot menu icon (approx. [88, 945]) was successful. A context menu appeared on the right side of the screen. The menu options are: \\'Play\\', \\'Play next\\', \\'Add to playing queue\\', \\'Add to playlist\\', \\'Rename\\', \\'Delete\\', and \\'Save as file\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the \\'Add to playlist\\' option is now visible and can be selected to proceed with adding songs.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[259,627],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu. The text \\'Add to playlist\\' is visible with bounding box [247, 429, 271, 825]. This action is expected to open a song selection interface, allowing songs to be added to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu (coordinates [259, 627] in the previous screen) was successful in triggering an action. However, it did not lead to the expected song selection interface. Instead, a dialog titled \\'Add to playlist\\' appeared, prompting to add the *current playlist* to another playlist. This is not the functionality required to add songs *into* the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The current dialog needs to be dismissed to pursue an alternative method for adding songs.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[602,776],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Cancel\\' button (text \\'Cancel\\', bounding box [594, 720, 611, 832]) to close the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog. This dialog was opened incorrectly in the previous step. Closing it will allow the agent to pursue the correct method for adding songs to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Cancel\\' button (coordinates [602, 776] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog, which was incorrectly opened, has been closed. The screen now displays the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist view, showing \\'0 Songs\\' and \\'You have no songs\\'. This action corrected the previous misstep and allows the agent to proceed with the alternative plan for adding songs. The agent is now ready to navigate back to find the songs.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,66],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located at the top left of the screen (approximate coordinates [88, 66]). This action is intended to navigate back from the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist view to the previous screen, which is likely the list of playlists or the main library, so that songs can be searched for and added. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (approximate coordinates [88, 66]) was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist screen back to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal because it allows for a new approach to adding songs by first navigating to the song library.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[932,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the musical note icon in the bottom navigation bar (approximate center [932, 300]). This icon represents the \\'Songs\\' tab. This action is intended to navigate to the list of all songs in the library, which is the first step in finding and adding the required songs to the playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Songs\\' tab icon (approximate center [932, 300]) was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Songs\\' screen. The \\'Songs\\' screen now displays a list of all available songs. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal because it allows the agent to search for and select songs to add to the playlist.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 18: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,66],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at the top left of the screen, approximately at coordinates [88, 66]. This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a search bar or search interface, allowing the user to search for songs by name. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Retro Music App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Retro Music app is open and its main interface is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[259,627],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu. The text \\'Add to playlist\\' is visible with bounding box [247, 429, 271, 825]. This action is expected to open a song selection interface, allowing songs to be added to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu (coordinates [259, 627] in the previous screen) was successful in triggering an action. However, it did not lead to the expected song selection interface. Instead, a dialog titled \\'Add to playlist\\' appeared, prompting to add the *current playlist* to another playlist. This is not the functionality required to add songs *into* the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The current dialog needs to be dismissed to pursue an alternative method for adding songs.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[602,776],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Cancel\\' button (text \\'Cancel\\', bounding box [594, 720, 611, 832]) to close the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog. This dialog was opened incorrectly in the previous step. Closing it will allow the agent to pursue the correct method for adding songs to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Cancel\\' button (coordinates [602, 776] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog, which was incorrectly opened, has been closed. The screen now displays the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist view, showing \\'0 Songs\\' and \\'You have no songs\\'. This action corrected the previous misstep and allows the agent to proceed with the alternative plan for adding songs. The agent is now ready to navigate back to find the songs.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,66],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located at the top left of the screen (approximate coordinates [88, 66]). This action is intended to navigate back from the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist view to the previous screen, which is likely the list of playlists or the main library, so that songs can be searched for and added. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (approximate coordinates [88, 66]) was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist screen back to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal because it allows for a new approach to adding songs by first navigating to the song library.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[932,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the musical note icon in the bottom navigation bar (approximate center [932, 300]). This icon represents the \\'Songs\\' tab. This action is intended to navigate to the list of all songs in the library, which is the first step in finding and adding the required songs to the playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Songs\\' tab icon (approximate center [932, 300]) was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Songs\\' screen. The \\'Songs\\' screen now displays a list of all available songs. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal because it allows the agent to search for and select songs to add to the playlist.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,66],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at the top left of the screen, approximately at coordinates [88, 66]. This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a search bar or search interface, allowing the user to search for songs by name. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) at coordinates [88, 66] was successful. The application transitioned from the \\'Songs\\' list screen to a search interface. A search text field with the placeholder \\'Search\\' is now active and focused at the top of the screen, and the virtual keyboard is visible. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as it allows for searching for the songs to be added to the playlist.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.48\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [75, 168, 102, 302], \\'text\\': \\'|earch\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [144, 48, 168, 172], \\'text\\': \\'Songs\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [147, 268, 163, 391], \\'text\\': \\'Artists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [146, 490, 163, 630], \\'text\\': \\'Albums\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [145, 729, 163, 952], \\'text\\': \\'Album artist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [480, 386, 502, 622], \\'text\\': \\'No results\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [778, 694, 808, 918], \\'text\\': \\'Keyboard\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 444, 179, 669]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 221, 179, 432]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 681, 179, 990]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 8, 179, 210]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [760, 565, 823, 966]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 902, 110, 982]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 819, 40, 948]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 194, 38, 244]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"1\", text=\"Search\", resource-id=\"code.name.monkey.retromusic:id/searchView\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"code.name.monkey.retromusic\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[147,148][953,275]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"Search\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then export the playlist to the Downloads directory on the device.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[259,627],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu. The text \\'Add to playlist\\' is visible with bounding box [247, 429, 271, 825]. This action is expected to open a song selection interface, allowing songs to be added to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu (coordinates [259, 627] in the previous screen) was successful in triggering an action. However, it did not lead to the expected song selection interface. Instead, a dialog titled \\'Add to playlist\\' appeared, prompting to add the *current playlist* to another playlist. This is not the functionality required to add songs *into* the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The current dialog needs to be dismissed to pursue an alternative method for adding songs.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[602,776],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Cancel\\' button (text \\'Cancel\\', bounding box [594, 720, 611, 832]) to close the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog. This dialog was opened incorrectly in the previous step. Closing it will allow the agent to pursue the correct method for adding songs to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Cancel\\' button (coordinates [602, 776] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog, which was incorrectly opened, has been closed. The screen now displays the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist view, showing \\'0 Songs\\' and \\'You have no songs\\'. This action corrected the previous misstep and allows the agent to proceed with the alternative plan for adding songs. The agent is now ready to navigate back to find the songs.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,66],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located at the top left of the screen (approximate coordinates [88, 66]). This action is intended to navigate back from the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist view to the previous screen, which is likely the list of playlists or the main library, so that songs can be searched for and added. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (approximate coordinates [88, 66]) was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist screen back to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal because it allows for a new approach to adding songs by first navigating to the song library.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[932,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the musical note icon in the bottom navigation bar (approximate center [932, 300]). This icon represents the \\'Songs\\' tab. This action is intended to navigate to the list of all songs in the library, which is the first step in finding and adding the required songs to the playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Songs\\' tab icon (approximate center [932, 300]) was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Songs\\' screen. The \\'Songs\\' screen now displays a list of all available songs. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal because it allows the agent to search for and select songs to add to the playlist.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,66],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at the top left of the screen, approximately at coordinates [88, 66]. This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a search bar or search interface, allowing the user to search for songs by name. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) at coordinates [88, 66] was successful. The application transitioned from the \\'Songs\\' list screen to a search interface. A search text field with the placeholder \\'Search\\' is now active and focused at the top of the screen, and the virtual keyboard is visible. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as it allows for searching for the songs to be added to the playlist.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 19: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Chasing Shadows\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Chasing Shadows\\' followed by a newline character into the focused search field (currently displaying \\'Search\\', bounds [147,148][953,275]). This is expected to replace the placeholder text with \\'Chasing Shadows\\' and initiate the search for the song. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Retro Music App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Retro Music app is open and its main interface is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[602,776],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Cancel\\' button (text \\'Cancel\\', bounding box [594, 720, 611, 832]) to close the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog. This dialog was opened incorrectly in the previous step. Closing it will allow the agent to pursue the correct method for adding songs to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Cancel\\' button (coordinates [602, 776] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog, which was incorrectly opened, has been closed. The screen now displays the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist view, showing \\'0 Songs\\' and \\'You have no songs\\'. This action corrected the previous misstep and allows the agent to proceed with the alternative plan for adding songs. The agent is now ready to navigate back to find the songs.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,66],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located at the top left of the screen (approximate coordinates [88, 66]). This action is intended to navigate back from the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist view to the previous screen, which is likely the list of playlists or the main library, so that songs can be searched for and added. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (approximate coordinates [88, 66]) was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist screen back to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal because it allows for a new approach to adding songs by first navigating to the song library.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[932,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the musical note icon in the bottom navigation bar (approximate center [932, 300]). This icon represents the \\'Songs\\' tab. This action is intended to navigate to the list of all songs in the library, which is the first step in finding and adding the required songs to the playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Songs\\' tab icon (approximate center [932, 300]) was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Songs\\' screen. The \\'Songs\\' screen now displays a list of all available songs. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal because it allows the agent to search for and select songs to add to the playlist.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,66],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at the top left of the screen, approximately at coordinates [88, 66]. This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a search bar or search interface, allowing the user to search for songs by name. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) at coordinates [88, 66] was successful. The application transitioned from the \\'Songs\\' list screen to a search interface. A search text field with the placeholder \\'Search\\' is now active and focused at the top of the screen, and the virtual keyboard is visible. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as it allows for searching for the songs to be added to the playlist.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Chasing Shadows\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Chasing Shadows\\' followed by a newline character into the focused search field (currently displaying \\'Search\\', bounds [147,148][953,275]). This is expected to replace the placeholder text with \\'Chasing Shadows\\' and initiate the search for the song. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Chasing Shadows\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The search results now display the song \\'Chasing Shadows\\'.

The text you can edit is: \"Albums\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nCreate a playlist in Retro Music titled \"Blues Break 567\" with the following songs, in order: Chasing Shadows, Lost in the Echo, Twilight Calling. Then export the playlist to the Downloads directory on the device.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[602,776],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Cancel\\' button (text \\'Cancel\\', bounding box [594, 720, 611, 832]) to close the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog. This dialog was opened incorrectly in the previous step. Closing it will allow the agent to pursue the correct method for adding songs to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Cancel\\' button (coordinates [602, 776] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog, which was incorrectly opened, has been closed. The screen now displays the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist view, showing \\'0 Songs\\' and \\'You have no songs\\'. This action corrected the previous misstep and allows the agent to proceed with the alternative plan for adding songs. The agent is now ready to navigate back to find the songs.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,66],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located at the top left of the screen (approximate coordinates [88, 66]). This action is intended to navigate back from the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist view to the previous screen, which is likely the list of playlists or the main library, so that songs can be searched for and added. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (approximate coordinates [88, 66]) was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist screen back to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal because it allows for a new approach to adding songs by first navigating to the song library.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[932,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the musical note icon in the bottom navigation bar (approximate center [932, 300]). This icon represents the \\'Songs\\' tab. This action is intended to navigate to the list of all songs in the library, which is the first step in finding and adding the required songs to the playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Songs\\' tab icon (approximate center [932, 300]) was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Songs\\' screen. The \\'Songs\\' screen now displays a list of all available songs. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal because it allows the agent to search for and select songs to add to the playlist.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,66],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at the top left of the screen, approximately at coordinates [88, 66]. This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a search bar or search interface, allowing the user to search for songs by name. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) at coordinates [88, 66] was successful. The application transitioned from the \\'Songs\\' list screen to a search interface. A search text field with the placeholder \\'Search\\' is now active and focused at the top of the screen, and the virtual keyboard is visible. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as it allows for searching for the songs to be added to the playlist.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Chasing Shadows\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Chasing Shadows\\' followed by a newline character into the focused search field (currently displaying \\'Search\\', bounds [147,148][953,275]). This is expected to replace the placeholder text with \\'Chasing Shadows\\' and initiate the search for the song. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Chasing Shadows\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The search results now display the song \\'Chasing Shadows\\'. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding songs to the playlist.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 20: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon (approximate center [268, 938], bounding box [243, 883, 294, 994]) located to the right of the \\'Chasing Shadows\\' song entry. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playlist\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Retro Music App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Retro Music app is open and its main interface is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,66],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located at the top left of the screen (approximate coordinates [88, 66]). This action is intended to navigate back from the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist view to the previous screen, which is likely the list of playlists or the main library, so that songs can be searched for and added. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (approximate coordinates [88, 66]) was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist screen back to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal because it allows for a new approach to adding songs by first navigating to the song library.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[932,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the musical note icon in the bottom navigation bar (approximate center [932, 300]). This icon represents the \\'Songs\\' tab. This action is intended to navigate to the list of all songs in the library, which is the first step in finding and adding the required songs to the playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Songs\\' tab icon (approximate center [932, 300]) was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Songs\\' screen. The \\'Songs\\' screen now displays a list of all available songs. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal because it allows the agent to search for and select songs to add to the playlist.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,66],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at the top left of the screen, approximately at coordinates [88, 66]. This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a search bar or search interface, allowing the user to search for songs by name. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) at coordinates [88, 66] was successful. The application transitioned from the \\'Songs\\' list screen to a search interface. A search text field with the placeholder \\'Search\\' is now active and focused at the top of the screen, and the virtual keyboard is visible. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as it allows for searching for the songs to be added to the playlist.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Chasing Shadows\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Chasing Shadows\\' followed by a newline character into the focused search field (currently displaying \\'Search\\', bounds [147,148][953,275]). This is expected to replace the placeholder text with \\'Chasing Shadows\\' and initiate the search for the song. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Chasing Shadows\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The search results now display the song \\'Chasing Shadows\\'. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding songs to the playlist.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon (approximate center [268, 938], bounding box [243, 883, 294, 994]) located to the right of the \\'Chasing Shadows\\' song entry. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playlist\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot menu icon (approximate coordinates [268, 938] in the previous screen) next to the \\'Chasing Shadows\\' song was successful. A context menu popped up on the right side of the screen, displaying various options for the song, including \\'Add to playlist\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding songs to the playlist.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.49\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [76, 168, 102, 497], \\'text\\': \\'Chasing Shadows\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [144, 48, 168, 172], \\'text\\': \\'Songs\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [147, 268, 163, 391], \\'text\\': \\'Artists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [146, 490, 163, 630], \\'text\\': \\'Albums\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [145, 729, 163, 952], \\'text\\': \\'Album artist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [202, 19, 214, 122], \\'text\\': \\'SONG S\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [241, 183, 288, 512], \\'text\\': \\'Chasing Shadows Music\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [320, 558, 342, 735], \\'text\\': \\'Play next\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [373, 561, 397, 955], \\'text\\': \\'Add to playing queue\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [425, 562, 448, 833], \\'text\\': \\'Add to playlist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [478, 561, 496, 787], \\'text\\': \\'Go to album\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [531, 561, 548, 775], \\'text\\': \\'Go to artist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [583, 559, 601, 671], \\'text\\': \\'Share\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [635, 560, 658, 753], \\'text\\': \\'Tag editor\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [688, 561, 706, 693], \\'text\\': \\'Details\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [740, 558, 762, 844], \\'text\\': \\'Set as ringtone\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [793, 563, 811, 854], \\'text\\': \\'Add to Blacklist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [846, 561, 863, 910], \\'text\\': \\'Delete from device\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 444, 179, 669]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 681, 179, 991]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 221, 179, 431]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 8, 179, 210]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 905, 108, 980]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [777, 531, 829, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [244, 896, 288, 986]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 38, 243]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [13, 817, 40, 952]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [460, 540, 515, 1000]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then export the playlist to the Downloads directory on the device.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,66],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located at the top left of the screen (approximate coordinates [88, 66]). This action is intended to navigate back from the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist view to the previous screen, which is likely the list of playlists or the main library, so that songs can be searched for and added. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (approximate coordinates [88, 66]) was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist screen back to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal because it allows for a new approach to adding songs by first navigating to the song library.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[932,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the musical note icon in the bottom navigation bar (approximate center [932, 300]). This icon represents the \\'Songs\\' tab. This action is intended to navigate to the list of all songs in the library, which is the first step in finding and adding the required songs to the playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Songs\\' tab icon (approximate center [932, 300]) was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Songs\\' screen. The \\'Songs\\' screen now displays a list of all available songs. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal because it allows the agent to search for and select songs to add to the playlist.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,66],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at the top left of the screen, approximately at coordinates [88, 66]. This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a search bar or search interface, allowing the user to search for songs by name. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) at coordinates [88, 66] was successful. The application transitioned from the \\'Songs\\' list screen to a search interface. A search text field with the placeholder \\'Search\\' is now active and focused at the top of the screen, and the virtual keyboard is visible. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as it allows for searching for the songs to be added to the playlist.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Chasing Shadows\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Chasing Shadows\\' followed by a newline character into the focused search field (currently displaying \\'Search\\', bounds [147,148][953,275]). This is expected to replace the placeholder text with \\'Chasing Shadows\\' and initiate the search for the song. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Chasing Shadows\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The search results now display the song \\'Chasing Shadows\\'. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding songs to the playlist.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon (approximate center [268, 938], bounding box [243, 883, 294, 994]) located to the right of the \\'Chasing Shadows\\' song entry. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playlist\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot menu icon (approximate coordinates [268, 938] in the previous screen) next to the \\'Chasing Shadows\\' song was successful. A context menu popped up on the right side of the screen, displaying various options for the song, including \\'Add to playlist\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding songs to the playlist.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 21: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[436,700],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Add to playlist\\' option is currently visible in the context menu for the song \\'Chasing Shadows\\'. This action is expected to open a dialog or screen where the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist can be selected to add the song. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Retro Music App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Retro Music app is open and its main interface is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[932,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the musical note icon in the bottom navigation bar (approximate center [932, 300]). This icon represents the \\'Songs\\' tab. This action is intended to navigate to the list of all songs in the library, which is the first step in finding and adding the required songs to the playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Songs\\' tab icon (approximate center [932, 300]) was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Songs\\' screen. The \\'Songs\\' screen now displays a list of all available songs. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal because it allows the agent to search for and select songs to add to the playlist.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,66],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at the top left of the screen, approximately at coordinates [88, 66]. This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a search bar or search interface, allowing the user to search for songs by name. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) at coordinates [88, 66] was successful. The application transitioned from the \\'Songs\\' list screen to a search interface. A search text field with the placeholder \\'Search\\' is now active and focused at the top of the screen, and the virtual keyboard is visible. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as it allows for searching for the songs to be added to the playlist.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Chasing Shadows\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Chasing Shadows\\' followed by a newline character into the focused search field (currently displaying \\'Search\\', bounds [147,148][953,275]). This is expected to replace the placeholder text with \\'Chasing Shadows\\' and initiate the search for the song. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Chasing Shadows\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The search results now display the song \\'Chasing Shadows\\'. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding songs to the playlist.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon (approximate center [268, 938], bounding box [243, 883, 294, 994]) located to the right of the \\'Chasing Shadows\\' song entry. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playlist\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot menu icon (approximate coordinates [268, 938] in the previous screen) next to the \\'Chasing Shadows\\' song was successful. A context menu popped up on the right side of the screen, displaying various options for the song, including \\'Add to playlist\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding songs to the playlist.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[436,700],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Add to playlist\\' option is currently visible in the context menu for the song \\'Chasing Shadows\\'. This action is expected to open a dialog or screen where the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist can be selected to add the song. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu (approximate coordinates [436, 700] in the previous screen) was successful. A dialog titled \\'Add to playlist\\' appeared on the screen. This dialog presents a list of available playlists, including \\'New playlist\\' and \\'Blues Break 567\\', and a \\'Cancel\\' button. This outcome directly moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to select the target playlist from this dialog.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.50\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [76, 168, 102, 497], \\'text\\': \\'Chasing Shadows\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [144, 48, 168, 172], \\'text\\': \\'Songs\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [147, 268, 163, 391], \\'text\\': \\'Artists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [146, 490, 163, 630], \\'text\\': \\'Albums\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [145, 729, 163, 952], \\'text\\': \\'Album artist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [202, 19, 214, 122], \\'text\\': \\'SONGS\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [242, 183, 288, 510], \\'text\\': \\'Chasing Shadows Music\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [408, 143, 440, 522], \\'text\\': \\'Add to playlist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [474, 143, 494, 340], \\'text\\': \\'New playlist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [527, 140, 542, 400], \\'text\\': \\'Blues Break 567\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [594, 720, 611, 832], \\'text\\': \\'Cancel\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [778, 696, 808, 918], \\'text\\': \\'Keyboard\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 445, 178, 669]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 682, 179, 990]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 8, 179, 210]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 222, 179, 431]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [760, 567, 824, 965]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 905, 108, 980]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [250, 903, 285, 986]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then export the playlist to the Downloads directory on the device.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[932,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the musical note icon in the bottom navigation bar (approximate center [932, 300]). This icon represents the \\'Songs\\' tab. This action is intended to navigate to the list of all songs in the library, which is the first step in finding and adding the required songs to the playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Songs\\' tab icon (approximate center [932, 300]) was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Songs\\' screen. The \\'Songs\\' screen now displays a list of all available songs. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal because it allows the agent to search for and select songs to add to the playlist.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,66],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at the top left of the screen, approximately at coordinates [88, 66]. This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a search bar or search interface, allowing the user to search for songs by name. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) at coordinates [88, 66] was successful. The application transitioned from the \\'Songs\\' list screen to a search interface. A search text field with the placeholder \\'Search\\' is now active and focused at the top of the screen, and the virtual keyboard is visible. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as it allows for searching for the songs to be added to the playlist.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Chasing Shadows\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Chasing Shadows\\' followed by a newline character into the focused search field (currently displaying \\'Search\\', bounds [147,148][953,275]). This is expected to replace the placeholder text with \\'Chasing Shadows\\' and initiate the search for the song. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Chasing Shadows\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The search results now display the song \\'Chasing Shadows\\'. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding songs to the playlist.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon (approximate center [268, 938], bounding box [243, 883, 294, 994]) located to the right of the \\'Chasing Shadows\\' song entry. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playlist\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot menu icon (approximate coordinates [268, 938] in the previous screen) next to the \\'Chasing Shadows\\' song was successful. A context menu popped up on the right side of the screen, displaying various options for the song, including \\'Add to playlist\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding songs to the playlist.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[436,700],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Add to playlist\\' option is currently visible in the context menu for the song \\'Chasing Shadows\\'. This action is expected to open a dialog or screen where the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist can be selected to add the song. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu (approximate coordinates [436, 700] in the previous screen) was successful. A dialog titled \\'Add to playlist\\' appeared on the screen. This dialog presents a list of available playlists, including \\'New playlist\\' and \\'Blues Break 567\\', and a \\'Cancel\\' button. This outcome directly moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to select the target playlist from this dialog.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 22: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[534,270],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Blues Break 567\\' option in the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is expected to replace the placeholder text with \\'Chasing Shadows\\' and initiate the search for the song. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Chasing Shadows\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The search results now display the song \\'Chasing Shadows\\'. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding songs to the playlist.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon (approximate center [268, 938], bounding box [243, 883, 294, 994]) located to the right of the \\'Chasing Shadows\\' song entry. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playlist\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot menu icon (approximate coordinates [268, 938] in the previous screen) next to the \\'Chasing Shadows\\' song was successful. A context menu popped up on the right side of the screen, displaying various options for the song, including \\'Add to playlist\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding songs to the playlist.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[436,700],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Add to playlist\\' option is currently visible in the context menu for the song \\'Chasing Shadows\\'. This action is expected to open a dialog or screen where the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist can be selected to add the song. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu (approximate coordinates [436, 700] in the previous screen) was successful. A dialog titled \\'Add to playlist\\' appeared on the screen. This dialog presents a list of available playlists, including \\'New playlist\\' and \\'Blues Break 567\\', and a \\'Cancel\\' button. This outcome directly moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to select the target playlist from this dialog.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[534,270],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Blues Break 567\\' option in the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog. The \\'Blues Break 567\\' option is currently visible. This action is expected to add the song \\'Chasing Shadows\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist and close the dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Blues Break 567\\' (approximate coordinates [534, 270] from the previous screen context) in the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog was successful. The dialog closed, signifying that the song \\'Chasing Shadows\\' has been added to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. This action moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The current screen shows the search results for \\'Chasing Shadows\\'. The next step is to clear the search field to search for the next song.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 132], \\'text\\': \\'15.51\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [76, 168, 102, 497], \\'text\\': \\'Chasing Shadows\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [144, 48, 168, 172], \\'text\\': \\'Songs\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [147, 268, 163, 391], \\'text\\': \\'Artists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [146, 490, 163, 630], \\'text\\': \\'Albums\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [145, 729, 163, 952], \\'text\\': \\'Album artist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [202, 19, 214, 122], \\'text\\': \\'SONG S\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [241, 183, 288, 510], \\'text\\': \\'Chasing Shadows Music\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [826, 696, 856, 919], \\'text\\': \\'Keyboard\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [920, 865, 941, 927], \\'text\\': \\'=\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [945, 251, 961, 350], \\'text\\': \\'Songs\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 444, 179, 669]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 681, 179, 990]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 222, 179, 431]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [808, 567, 870, 964]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 8, 179, 210]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [899, 200, 969, 395]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [906, 46, 960, 153]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [907, 646, 959, 760]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [242, 882, 294, 994]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [74, 907, 107, 978]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [889, 366, 1000, 634]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [909, 847, 956, 956]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 37, 243]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 819, 40, 950]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [240, 33, 294, 158]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then export the playlist to the Downloads directory on the device.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,66],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at the top left of the screen, approximately at coordinates [88, 66]. This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a search bar or search interface, allowing the user to search for songs by name. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) at coordinates [88, 66] was successful. The application transitioned from the \\'Songs\\' list screen to a search interface. A search text field with the placeholder \\'Search\\' is now active and focused at the top of the screen, and the virtual keyboard is visible. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as it allows for searching for the songs to be added to the playlist.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Chasing Shadows\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Chasing Shadows\\' followed by a newline character into the focused search field (currently displaying \\'Search\\', bounds [147,148][953,275]). This is expected to replace the placeholder text with \\'Chasing Shadows\\' and initiate the search for the song. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Chasing Shadows\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The search results now display the song \\'Chasing Shadows\\'. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding songs to the playlist.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon (approximate center [268, 938], bounding box [243, 883, 294, 994]) located to the right of the \\'Chasing Shadows\\' song entry. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playlist\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot menu icon (approximate coordinates [268, 938] in the previous screen) next to the \\'Chasing Shadows\\' song was successful. A context menu popped up on the right side of the screen, displaying various options for the song, including \\'Add to playlist\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding songs to the playlist.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[436,700],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Add to playlist\\' option is currently visible in the context menu for the song \\'Chasing Shadows\\'. This action is expected to open a dialog or screen where the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist can be selected to add the song. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu (approximate coordinates [436, 700] in the previous screen) was successful. A dialog titled \\'Add to playlist\\' appeared on the screen. This dialog presents a list of available playlists, including \\'New playlist\\' and \\'Blues Break 567\\', and a \\'Cancel\\' button. This outcome directly moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to select the target playlist from this dialog.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[534,270],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Blues Break 567\\' option in the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog. The \\'Blues Break 567\\' option is currently visible. This action is expected to add the song \\'Chasing Shadows\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist and close the dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Blues Break 567\\' (approximate coordinates [534, 270] from the previous screen context) in the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog was successful. The dialog closed, signifying that the song \\'Chasing Shadows\\' has been added to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. This action moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The current screen shows the search results for \\'Chasing Shadows\\'. The next step is to clear the search field to search for the next song.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 23: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,942],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon (clear search) located at the top right of the screen, approximately at coordinates [90, 942]. This icon is currently visible next to the search term \\'Chasing Shadows\\'. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing a new search term to be entered. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Retro Music App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Retro Music app is open and its main interface is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is expected to replace the placeholder text with \\'Chasing Shadows\\' and initiate the search for the song. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Chasing Shadows\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The search results now display the song \\'Chasing Shadows\\'. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding songs to the playlist.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon (approximate center [268, 938], bounding box [243, 883, 294, 994]) located to the right of the \\'Chasing Shadows\\' song entry. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playlist\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot menu icon (approximate coordinates [268, 938] in the previous screen) next to the \\'Chasing Shadows\\' song was successful. A context menu popped up on the right side of the screen, displaying various options for the song, including \\'Add to playlist\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding songs to the playlist.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[436,700],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Add to playlist\\' option is currently visible in the context menu for the song \\'Chasing Shadows\\'. This action is expected to open a dialog or screen where the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist can be selected to add the song. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu (approximate coordinates [436, 700] in the previous screen) was successful. A dialog titled \\'Add to playlist\\' appeared on the screen. This dialog presents a list of available playlists, including \\'New playlist\\' and \\'Blues Break 567\\', and a \\'Cancel\\' button. This outcome directly moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to select the target playlist from this dialog.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[534,270],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Blues Break 567\\' option in the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog. The \\'Blues Break 567\\' option is currently visible. This action is expected to add the song \\'Chasing Shadows\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist and close the dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Blues Break 567\\' (approximate coordinates [534, 270] from the previous screen context) in the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog was successful. The dialog closed, signifying that the song \\'Chasing Shadows\\' has been added to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. This action moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The current screen shows the search results for \\'Chasing Shadows\\'. The next step is to clear the search field to search for the next song.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,942],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon (clear search) located at the top right of the screen, approximately at coordinates [90, 942]. This icon is currently visible next to the search term \\'Chasing Shadows\\'. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing a new search term to be entered. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'X\\' icon (clear search) at approximately [90, 942] was successful. The search field was cleared, and it now displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. The screen shows \\'No results\\' as there is no active search query. This action successfully prepares the interface for the next song search and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 132], \\'text\\': \\'15.51\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [80, 171, 97, 298], \\'text\\': \\'Search\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [144, 48, 168, 172], \\'text\\': \\'Songs\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [147, 268, 163, 391], \\'text\\': \\'Artists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [146, 490, 163, 630], \\'text\\': \\'Albums\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [145, 729, 163, 952], \\'text\\': \\'Album artist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [505, 386, 526, 622], \\'text\\': \\'No results\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [826, 696, 856, 919], \\'text\\': \\'Keyboard\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [920, 865, 941, 927], \\'text\\': \\'=\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [945, 251, 961, 350], \\'text\\': \\'Songs\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 444, 179, 669]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 221, 179, 432]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 681, 179, 990]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 8, 179, 210]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [808, 566, 871, 964]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [899, 203, 969, 390]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [905, 44, 960, 155]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [907, 646, 957, 759]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 902, 110, 982]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [909, 849, 955, 956]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [890, 367, 1000, 633]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 194, 38, 244]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 820, 39, 921]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"Search\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nCreate a playlist in Retro Music titled \"Blues Break 567\" with the following songs, in order: Chasing Shadows, Lost in the Echo, Twilight Calling. Then export the playlist to the Downloads directory on the device.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Chasing Shadows\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Chasing Shadows\\' followed by a newline character into the focused search field (currently displaying \\'Search\\', bounds [147,148][953,275]). This is expected to replace the placeholder text with \\'Chasing Shadows\\' and initiate the search for the song. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Chasing Shadows\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The search results now display the song \\'Chasing Shadows\\'. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding songs to the playlist.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon (approximate center [268, 938], bounding box [243, 883, 294, 994]) located to the right of the \\'Chasing Shadows\\' song entry. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playlist\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot menu icon (approximate coordinates [268, 938] in the previous screen) next to the \\'Chasing Shadows\\' song was successful. A context menu popped up on the right side of the screen, displaying various options for the song, including \\'Add to playlist\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding songs to the playlist.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[436,700],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Add to playlist\\' option is currently visible in the context menu for the song \\'Chasing Shadows\\'. This action is expected to open a dialog or screen where the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist can be selected to add the song. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu (approximate coordinates [436, 700] in the previous screen) was successful. A dialog titled \\'Add to playlist\\' appeared on the screen. This dialog presents a list of available playlists, including \\'New playlist\\' and \\'Blues Break 567\\', and a \\'Cancel\\' button. This outcome directly moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to select the target playlist from this dialog.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[534,270],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Blues Break 567\\' option in the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog. The \\'Blues Break 567\\' option is currently visible. This action is expected to add the song \\'Chasing Shadows\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist and close the dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Blues Break 567\\' (approximate coordinates [534, 270] from the previous screen context) in the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog was successful. The dialog closed, signifying that the song \\'Chasing Shadows\\' has been added to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. This action moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The current screen shows the search results for \\'Chasing Shadows\\'. The next step is to clear the search field to search for the next song.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,942],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon (clear search) located at the top right of the screen, approximately at coordinates [90, 942]. This icon is currently visible next to the search term \\'Chasing Shadows\\'. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing a new search term to be entered. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'X\\' icon (clear search) at approximately [90, 942] was successful. The search field was cleared, and it now displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. The screen shows \\'No results\\' as there is no active search query. This action successfully prepares the interface for the next song search and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 24: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field (labeled \\'Search\\', bounding box approximately [80, 171, 97, 298]) to focus it and prepare for text input. This action is expected to bring up the virtual keyboard. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Retro Music App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Retro Music app is open and its main interface is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon (approximate center [268, 938], bounding box [243, 883, 294, 994]) located to the right of the \\'Chasing Shadows\\' song entry. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playlist\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot menu icon (approximate coordinates [268, 938] in the previous screen) next to the \\'Chasing Shadows\\' song was successful. A context menu popped up on the right side of the screen, displaying various options for the song, including \\'Add to playlist\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding songs to the playlist.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[436,700],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Add to playlist\\' option is currently visible in the context menu for the song \\'Chasing Shadows\\'. This action is expected to open a dialog or screen where the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist can be selected to add the song. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu (approximate coordinates [436, 700] in the previous screen) was successful. A dialog titled \\'Add to playlist\\' appeared on the screen. This dialog presents a list of available playlists, including \\'New playlist\\' and \\'Blues Break 567\\', and a \\'Cancel\\' button. This outcome directly moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to select the target playlist from this dialog.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[534,270],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Blues Break 567\\' option in the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog. The \\'Blues Break 567\\' option is currently visible. This action is expected to add the song \\'Chasing Shadows\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist and close the dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Blues Break 567\\' (approximate coordinates [534, 270] from the previous screen context) in the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog was successful. The dialog closed, signifying that the song \\'Chasing Shadows\\' has been added to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. This action moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The current screen shows the search results for \\'Chasing Shadows\\'. The next step is to clear the search field to search for the next song.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,942],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon (clear search) located at the top right of the screen, approximately at coordinates [90, 942]. This icon is currently visible next to the search term \\'Chasing Shadows\\'. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing a new search term to be entered. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'X\\' icon (clear search) at approximately [90, 942] was successful. The search field was cleared, and it now displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. The screen shows \\'No results\\' as there is no active search query. This action successfully prepares the interface for the next song search and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field (labeled \\'Search\\', bounding box approximately [80, 171, 97, 298]) to focus it and prepare for text input. This action is expected to bring up the virtual keyboard. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field (labeled \\'Search\\', approximate coordinates [88, 234] in the previous screen) was successful. The search field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen, as indicated by the \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' message. The text in the search field changed from \\'Search\\' to \\'|earch\\', signifying it\\'s ready for input. This action prepares the interface for searching the next song and moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.52\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [75, 168, 102, 302], \\'text\\': \\'|earch\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [144, 48, 168, 172], \\'text\\': \\'Songs\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [147, 268, 163, 391], \\'text\\': \\'Artists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [146, 490, 163, 630], \\'text\\': \\'Albums\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [145, 729, 163, 952], \\'text\\': \\'Album artist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [480, 386, 502, 622], \\'text\\': \\'No results\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [778, 694, 808, 918], \\'text\\': \\'Keyboard\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 444, 179, 669]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 222, 179, 432]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 681, 179, 990]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 8, 179, 210]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [760, 565, 823, 966]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 902, 110, 982]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 194, 38, 244]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [13, 819, 41, 946]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"1\", text=\"Search\", resource-id=\"code.name.monkey.retromusic:id/searchView\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"code.name.monkey.retromusic\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[147,148][953,275]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"Search\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then export the playlist to the Downloads directory on the device.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon (approximate center [268, 938], bounding box [243, 883, 294, 994]) located to the right of the \\'Chasing Shadows\\' song entry. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playlist\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot menu icon (approximate coordinates [268, 938] in the previous screen) next to the \\'Chasing Shadows\\' song was successful. A context menu popped up on the right side of the screen, displaying various options for the song, including \\'Add to playlist\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding songs to the playlist.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[436,700],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Add to playlist\\' option is currently visible in the context menu for the song \\'Chasing Shadows\\'. This action is expected to open a dialog or screen where the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist can be selected to add the song. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu (approximate coordinates [436, 700] in the previous screen) was successful. A dialog titled \\'Add to playlist\\' appeared on the screen. This dialog presents a list of available playlists, including \\'New playlist\\' and \\'Blues Break 567\\', and a \\'Cancel\\' button. This outcome directly moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to select the target playlist from this dialog.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[534,270],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Blues Break 567\\' option in the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog. The \\'Blues Break 567\\' option is currently visible. This action is expected to add the song \\'Chasing Shadows\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist and close the dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Blues Break 567\\' (approximate coordinates [534, 270] from the previous screen context) in the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog was successful. The dialog closed, signifying that the song \\'Chasing Shadows\\' has been added to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. This action moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The current screen shows the search results for \\'Chasing Shadows\\'. The next step is to clear the search field to search for the next song.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,942],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon (clear search) located at the top right of the screen, approximately at coordinates [90, 942]. This icon is currently visible next to the search term \\'Chasing Shadows\\'. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing a new search term to be entered. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'X\\' icon (clear search) at approximately [90, 942] was successful. The search field was cleared, and it now displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. The screen shows \\'No results\\' as there is no active search query. This action successfully prepares the interface for the next song search and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field (labeled \\'Search\\', bounding box approximately [80, 171, 97, 298]) to focus it and prepare for text input. This action is expected to bring up the virtual keyboard. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field (labeled \\'Search\\', approximate coordinates [88, 234] in the previous screen) was successful. The search field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen, as indicated by the \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' message. The text in the search field changed from \\'Search\\' to \\'|earch\\', signifying it\\'s ready for input. This action prepares the interface for searching the next song and moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 25: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Lost in the Echo\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Lost in the Echo\\\\n\\' into the focused search field. The search field currently displays \\'|earch\\' (placeholder \\'Search\\' with cursor). This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'Lost in the Echo\\' and then, due to the \\'\\\\n\\', initiate the search for this song. The expected outcome is that the search results for \\'Lost in the Echo\\' will be displayed. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Retro Music App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Retro Music app is open and its main interface is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The \\'Add to playlist\\' option is currently visible in the context menu for the song \\'Chasing Shadows\\'. This action is expected to open a dialog or screen where the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist can be selected to add the song. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu (approximate coordinates [436, 700] in the previous screen) was successful. A dialog titled \\'Add to playlist\\' appeared on the screen. This dialog presents a list of available playlists, including \\'New playlist\\' and \\'Blues Break 567\\', and a \\'Cancel\\' button. This outcome directly moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to select the target playlist from this dialog.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[534,270],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Blues Break 567\\' option in the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog. The \\'Blues Break 567\\' option is currently visible. This action is expected to add the song \\'Chasing Shadows\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist and close the dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Blues Break 567\\' (approximate coordinates [534, 270] from the previous screen context) in the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog was successful. The dialog closed, signifying that the song \\'Chasing Shadows\\' has been added to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. This action moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The current screen shows the search results for \\'Chasing Shadows\\'. The next step is to clear the search field to search for the next song.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,942],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon (clear search) located at the top right of the screen, approximately at coordinates [90, 942]. This icon is currently visible next to the search term \\'Chasing Shadows\\'. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing a new search term to be entered. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'X\\' icon (clear search) at approximately [90, 942] was successful. The search field was cleared, and it now displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. The screen shows \\'No results\\' as there is no active search query. This action successfully prepares the interface for the next song search and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field (labeled \\'Search\\', bounding box approximately [80, 171, 97, 298]) to focus it and prepare for text input. This action is expected to bring up the virtual keyboard. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field (labeled \\'Search\\', approximate coordinates [88, 234] in the previous screen) was successful. The search field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen, as indicated by the \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' message. The text in the search field changed from \\'Search\\' to \\'|earch\\', signifying it\\'s ready for input. This action prepares the interface for searching the next song and moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Lost in the Echo\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Lost in the Echo\\\\n\\' into the focused search field. The search field currently displays \\'|earch\\' (placeholder \\'Search\\' with cursor). This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'Lost in the Echo\\' and then, due to the \\'\\\\n\\', initiate the search for this song. The expected outcome is that the search results for \\'Lost in the Echo\\' will be displayed. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Lost in the Echo\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The search results now display the song \\'Lost in the Echo\\'. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding songs to the playlist. The focused element according to the XML data is \\'Albums\\', which is unexpected, but the search itself worked.

The text you can edit is: \"Albums\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then export the playlist to the Downloads directory on the device.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[436,700],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Add to playlist\\' option is currently visible in the context menu for the song \\'Chasing Shadows\\'. This action is expected to open a dialog or screen where the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist can be selected to add the song. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu (approximate coordinates [436, 700] in the previous screen) was successful. A dialog titled \\'Add to playlist\\' appeared on the screen. This dialog presents a list of available playlists, including \\'New playlist\\' and \\'Blues Break 567\\', and a \\'Cancel\\' button. This outcome directly moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to select the target playlist from this dialog.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[534,270],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Blues Break 567\\' option in the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog. The \\'Blues Break 567\\' option is currently visible. This action is expected to add the song \\'Chasing Shadows\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist and close the dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Blues Break 567\\' (approximate coordinates [534, 270] from the previous screen context) in the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog was successful. The dialog closed, signifying that the song \\'Chasing Shadows\\' has been added to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. This action moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The current screen shows the search results for \\'Chasing Shadows\\'. The next step is to clear the search field to search for the next song.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,942],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon (clear search) located at the top right of the screen, approximately at coordinates [90, 942]. This icon is currently visible next to the search term \\'Chasing Shadows\\'. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing a new search term to be entered. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'X\\' icon (clear search) at approximately [90, 942] was successful. The search field was cleared, and it now displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. The screen shows \\'No results\\' as there is no active search query. This action successfully prepares the interface for the next song search and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field (labeled \\'Search\\', bounding box approximately [80, 171, 97, 298]) to focus it and prepare for text input. This action is expected to bring up the virtual keyboard. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field (labeled \\'Search\\', approximate coordinates [88, 234] in the previous screen) was successful. The search field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen, as indicated by the \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' message. The text in the search field changed from \\'Search\\' to \\'|earch\\', signifying it\\'s ready for input. This action prepares the interface for searching the next song and moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Lost in the Echo\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Lost in the Echo\\\\n\\' into the focused search field. The search field currently displays \\'|earch\\' (placeholder \\'Search\\' with cursor). This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'Lost in the Echo\\' and then, due to the \\'\\\\n\\', initiate the search for this song. The expected outcome is that the search results for \\'Lost in the Echo\\' will be displayed. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Lost in the Echo\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The search results now display the song \\'Lost in the Echo\\'. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding songs to the playlist. The focused element according to the XML data is \\'Albums\\', which is unexpected, but the search itself worked. The next step is to interact with the search result.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 26: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon next to the song \\'Lost in the Echo\\'. The icon is located at approximately [268, 938]. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playlist\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Retro Music App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Retro Music app is open and its main interface is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[534,270],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Blues Break 567\\' option in the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog. The \\'Blues Break 567\\' option is currently visible. This action is expected to add the song \\'Chasing Shadows\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist and close the dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Blues Break 567\\' (approximate coordinates [534, 270] from the previous screen context) in the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog was successful. The dialog closed, signifying that the song \\'Chasing Shadows\\' has been added to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. This action moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The current screen shows the search results for \\'Chasing Shadows\\'. The next step is to clear the search field to search for the next song.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,942],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon (clear search) located at the top right of the screen, approximately at coordinates [90, 942]. This icon is currently visible next to the search term \\'Chasing Shadows\\'. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing a new search term to be entered. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'X\\' icon (clear search) at approximately [90, 942] was successful. The search field was cleared, and it now displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. The screen shows \\'No results\\' as there is no active search query. This action successfully prepares the interface for the next song search and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field (labeled \\'Search\\', bounding box approximately [80, 171, 97, 298]) to focus it and prepare for text input. This action is expected to bring up the virtual keyboard. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field (labeled \\'Search\\', approximate coordinates [88, 234] in the previous screen) was successful. The search field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen, as indicated by the \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' message. The text in the search field changed from \\'Search\\' to \\'|earch\\', signifying it\\'s ready for input. This action prepares the interface for searching the next song and moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Lost in the Echo\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Lost in the Echo\\\\n\\' into the focused search field. The search field currently displays \\'|earch\\' (placeholder \\'Search\\' with cursor). This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'Lost in the Echo\\' and then, due to the \\'\\\\n\\', initiate the search for this song. The expected outcome is that the search results for \\'Lost in the Echo\\' will be displayed. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Lost in the Echo\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The search results now display the song \\'Lost in the Echo\\'. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding songs to the playlist. The focused element according to the XML data is \\'Albums\\', which is unexpected, but the search itself worked. The next step is to interact with the search result.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon next to the song \\'Lost in the Echo\\'. The icon is located at approximately [268, 938]. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playlist\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot menu icon (approximate coordinates [268, 938] in the previous screen) next to the song \\'Lost in the Echo\\' was successful. A context menu appeared on the screen, overlaying the search results. This menu provides several options for the selected song, including \\'Add to playlist\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding songs to the playlist.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then export the playlist to the Downloads directory on the device.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[534,270],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Blues Break 567\\' option in the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog. The \\'Blues Break 567\\' option is currently visible. This action is expected to add the song \\'Chasing Shadows\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist and close the dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Blues Break 567\\' (approximate coordinates [534, 270] from the previous screen context) in the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog was successful. The dialog closed, signifying that the song \\'Chasing Shadows\\' has been added to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. This action moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The current screen shows the search results for \\'Chasing Shadows\\'. The next step is to clear the search field to search for the next song.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,942],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon (clear search) located at the top right of the screen, approximately at coordinates [90, 942]. This icon is currently visible next to the search term \\'Chasing Shadows\\'. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing a new search term to be entered. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'X\\' icon (clear search) at approximately [90, 942] was successful. The search field was cleared, and it now displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. The screen shows \\'No results\\' as there is no active search query. This action successfully prepares the interface for the next song search and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field (labeled \\'Search\\', bounding box approximately [80, 171, 97, 298]) to focus it and prepare for text input. This action is expected to bring up the virtual keyboard. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field (labeled \\'Search\\', approximate coordinates [88, 234] in the previous screen) was successful. The search field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen, as indicated by the \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' message. The text in the search field changed from \\'Search\\' to \\'|earch\\', signifying it\\'s ready for input. This action prepares the interface for searching the next song and moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Lost in the Echo\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Lost in the Echo\\\\n\\' into the focused search field. The search field currently displays \\'|earch\\' (placeholder \\'Search\\' with cursor). This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'Lost in the Echo\\' and then, due to the \\'\\\\n\\', initiate the search for this song. The expected outcome is that the search results for \\'Lost in the Echo\\' will be displayed. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Lost in the Echo\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The search results now display the song \\'Lost in the Echo\\'. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding songs to the playlist. The focused element according to the XML data is \\'Albums\\', which is unexpected, but the search itself worked. The next step is to interact with the search result.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon next to the song \\'Lost in the Echo\\'. The icon is located at approximately [268, 938]. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playlist\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot menu icon (approximate coordinates [268, 938] in the previous screen) next to the song \\'Lost in the Echo\\' was successful. A context menu appeared on the screen, overlaying the search results. This menu provides several options for the selected song, including \\'Add to playlist\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding songs to the playlist.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 27: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[436,697],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Add to playlist\\' option is currently visible. This action is expected to open a dialog listing available playlists, allowing the selection of \\'Blues Break 567\\'.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This icon is currently visible next to the search term \\'Chasing Shadows\\'. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing a new search term to be entered. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'X\\' icon (clear search) at approximately [90, 942] was successful. The search field was cleared, and it now displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. The screen shows \\'No results\\' as there is no active search query. This action successfully prepares the interface for the next song search and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field (labeled \\'Search\\', bounding box approximately [80, 171, 97, 298]) to focus it and prepare for text input. This action is expected to bring up the virtual keyboard. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field (labeled \\'Search\\', approximate coordinates [88, 234] in the previous screen) was successful. The search field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen, as indicated by the \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' message. The text in the search field changed from \\'Search\\' to \\'|earch\\', signifying it\\'s ready for input. This action prepares the interface for searching the next song and moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Lost in the Echo\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Lost in the Echo\\\\n\\' into the focused search field. The search field currently displays \\'|earch\\' (placeholder \\'Search\\' with cursor). This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'Lost in the Echo\\' and then, due to the \\'\\\\n\\', initiate the search for this song. The expected outcome is that the search results for \\'Lost in the Echo\\' will be displayed. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Lost in the Echo\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The search results now display the song \\'Lost in the Echo\\'. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding songs to the playlist. The focused element according to the XML data is \\'Albums\\', which is unexpected, but the search itself worked.

Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot menu icon (approximate coordinates [268, 938] in the previous screen) next to the song \\'Lost in the Echo\\' was successful. A context menu appeared on the screen, overlaying the search results. This menu provides several options for the selected song, including \\'Add to playlist\\'.

Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then export the playlist to the Downloads directory on the device.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,942],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon (clear search) located at the top right of the screen, approximately at coordinates [90, 942]. This icon is currently visible next to the search term \\'Chasing Shadows\\'. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing a new search term to be entered. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'X\\' icon (clear search) at approximately [90, 942] was successful. The search field was cleared, and it now displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. The screen shows \\'No results\\' as there is no active search query. This action successfully prepares the interface for the next song search and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field (labeled \\'Search\\', bounding box approximately [80, 171, 97, 298]) to focus it and prepare for text input. This action is expected to bring up the virtual keyboard. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field (labeled \\'Search\\', approximate coordinates [88, 234] in the previous screen) was successful. The search field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen, as indicated by the \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' message. The text in the search field changed from \\'Search\\' to \\'|earch\\', signifying it\\'s ready for input. This action prepares the interface for searching the next song and moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Lost in the Echo\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Lost in the Echo\\\\n\\' into the focused search field. The search field currently displays \\'|earch\\' (placeholder \\'Search\\' with cursor). This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'Lost in the Echo\\' and then, due to the \\'\\\\n\\', initiate the search for this song. The expected outcome is that the search results for \\'Lost in the Echo\\' will be displayed. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Lost in the Echo\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The search results now display the song \\'Lost in the Echo\\'. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding songs to the playlist. The focused element according to the XML data is \\'Albums\\', which is unexpected, but the search itself worked. The next step is to interact with the search result.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon next to the song \\'Lost in the Echo\\'. The icon is located at approximately [268, 938]. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playlist\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot menu icon (approximate coordinates [268, 938] in the previous screen) next to the song \\'Lost in the Echo\\' was successful. A context menu appeared on the screen, overlaying the search results. This menu provides several options for the selected song, including \\'Add to playlist\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding songs to the playlist.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[436,697],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Add to playlist\\' option is currently visible. This action is expected to open a dialog listing available playlists, allowing the selection of \\'Blues Break 567\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playlist\\' (approximate coordinates [436, 697] from the previous screen context) was successful. An \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog appeared, showing options \\'New playlist\\' and \\'Blues Break 567\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Lost in the Echo\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 28: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[534,270],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Blues Break 567\\' option in the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog. The text \\'Blues Break 567\\' is visible with bounding box [527, 140, 542, 400]. This action is expected to add the song \\'Lost in the Echo\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist and close the dialog.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field (labeled \\'Search\\', bounding box approximately [80, 171, 97, 298]) to focus it and prepare for text input. This action is expected to bring up the virtual keyboard. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field (labeled \\'Search\\', approximate coordinates [88, 234] in the previous screen) was successful. The search field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen, as indicated by the \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' message. The text in the search field changed from \\'Search\\' to \\'|earch\\', signifying it\\'s ready for input. This action prepares the interface for searching the next song and moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Lost in the Echo\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Lost in the Echo\\\\n\\' into the focused search field. The search field currently displays \\'|earch\\' (placeholder \\'Search\\' with cursor). This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'Lost in the Echo\\' and then, due to the \\'\\\\n\\', initiate the search for this song. The expected outcome is that the search results for \\'Lost in the Echo\\' will be displayed. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Lost in the Echo\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The search results now display the song \\'Lost in the Echo\\'. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding songs to the playlist. The focused element according to the XML data is \\'Albums\\', which is unexpected, but the search itself worked. The next step is to interact with the search result.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon next to the song \\'Lost in the Echo\\'. The icon is located at approximately [268, 938]. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playlist\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot menu icon (approximate coordinates [268, 938] in the previous screen) next to the song \\'Lost in the Echo\\' was successful. A context menu appeared on the screen, overlaying the search results. This menu provides several options for the selected song, including \\'Add to playlist\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding songs to the playlist.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[436,697],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Add to playlist\\' option is currently visible. This action is expected to open a dialog listing available playlists, allowing the selection of \\'Blues Break 567\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playlist\\' (approximate coordinates [436, 697] from the previous screen context) was successful. An \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog appeared, showing options \\'New playlist\\' and \\'Blues Break 567\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Lost in the Echo\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[534,270],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Blues Break 567\\' option in the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog. The text \\'Blues Break 567\\' is visible with bounding box [527, 140, 542, 400]. This action is expected to add the song \\'Lost in the Echo\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist and close the dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Blues Break 567\\' (approximate coordinates [534, 270] from the previous screen context) in the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog was successful. The dialog closed, indicating that the song \\'Lost in the Echo\\' has been added to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.54\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 66, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [80, 172, 97, 460], \\'text\\': \\'Lost in the Echo\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [144, 48, 168, 172], \\'text\\': \\'Songs\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [146, 268, 163, 391], \\'text\\': \\'Artists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [146, 490, 163, 630], \\'text\\': \\'Albums\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [145, 729, 163, 952], \\'text\\': \\'Album artist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [202, 19, 214, 122], \\'text\\': \\'SONG S\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [245, 187, 262, 475], \\'text\\': \\'Lost in the Echo\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [272, 188, 288, 289], \\'text\\': \\'Music\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [826, 696, 856, 919], \\'text\\': \\'Keyboard\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [920, 865, 941, 927], \\'text\\': \\'=\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [945, 251, 961, 350], \\'text\\': \\'Songs\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 444, 179, 669]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 681, 179, 990]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 222, 179, 431]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 8, 179, 210]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [808, 567, 870, 964]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [899, 201, 969, 394]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [906, 45, 960, 154]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [907, 646, 960, 760]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [242, 881, 294, 994]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [73, 907, 108, 979]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [889, 366, 1000, 634]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [240, 35, 294, 158]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [909, 846, 956, 956]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 37, 243]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then export the playlist to the Downloads directory on the device.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field (labeled \\'Search\\', bounding box approximately [80, 171, 97, 298]) to focus it and prepare for text input. This action is expected to bring up the virtual keyboard. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field (labeled \\'Search\\', approximate coordinates [88, 234] in the previous screen) was successful. The search field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen, as indicated by the \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' message. The text in the search field changed from \\'Search\\' to \\'|earch\\', signifying it\\'s ready for input. This action prepares the interface for searching the next song and moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Lost in the Echo\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Lost in the Echo\\\\n\\' into the focused search field. The search field currently displays \\'|earch\\' (placeholder \\'Search\\' with cursor). This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'Lost in the Echo\\' and then, due to the \\'\\\\n\\', initiate the search for this song. The expected outcome is that the search results for \\'Lost in the Echo\\' will be displayed. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Lost in the Echo\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The search results now display the song \\'Lost in the Echo\\'. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding songs to the playlist. The focused element according to the XML data is \\'Albums\\', which is unexpected, but the search itself worked. The next step is to interact with the search result.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon next to the song \\'Lost in the Echo\\'. The icon is located at approximately [268, 938]. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playlist\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot menu icon (approximate coordinates [268, 938] in the previous screen) next to the song \\'Lost in the Echo\\' was successful. A context menu appeared on the screen, overlaying the search results. This menu provides several options for the selected song, including \\'Add to playlist\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding songs to the playlist.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[436,697],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Add to playlist\\' option is currently visible. This action is expected to open a dialog listing available playlists, allowing the selection of \\'Blues Break 567\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playlist\\' (approximate coordinates [436, 697] from the previous screen context) was successful. An \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog appeared, showing options \\'New playlist\\' and \\'Blues Break 567\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Lost in the Echo\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[534,270],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Blues Break 567\\' option in the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog. The text \\'Blues Break 567\\' is visible with bounding box [527, 140, 542, 400]. This action is expected to add the song \\'Lost in the Echo\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist and close the dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Blues Break 567\\' (approximate coordinates [534, 270] from the previous screen context) in the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog was successful. The dialog closed, indicating that the song \\'Lost in the Echo\\' has been added to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 29: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon (clear search) located at the top right of the screen, with an approximate bounding box of [73, 907, 108, 979]. This action is expected to clear the current search term \\'Lost in the Echo\\' from the search field, allowing for a new search.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The search field currently displays \\'|earch\\' (placeholder \\'Search\\' with cursor). This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'Lost in the Echo\\' and then, due to the \\'\\\\n\\', initiate the search for this song. The expected outcome is that the search results for \\'Lost in the Echo\\' will be displayed. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Lost in the Echo\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The search results now display the song \\'Lost in the Echo\\'. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding songs to the playlist. The focused element according to the XML data is \\'Albums\\', which is unexpected, but the search itself worked.

This action is expected to clear the current search term \\'Lost in the Echo\\' from the search field, allowing for a new search. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'X\\' icon (clear search) was successful. The search term \\'Lost in the Echo\\' was cleared from the search field, and the search field now displays the placeholder \\'Search\\'. The search results area shows \\'No results\\'. This action prepares the interface for searching the next song, \\'Twilight Calling\\', and moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.55\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [80, 171, 97, 298], \\'text\\': \\'Search\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [144, 48, 168, 172], \\'text\\': \\'Songs\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [147, 268, 163, 391], \\'text\\': \\'Artists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [146, 490, 163, 630], \\'text\\': \\'Albums\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [145, 729, 163, 952], \\'text\\': \\'Album artist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [505, 386, 526, 622], \\'text\\': \\'No results\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [826, 696, 856, 919], \\'text\\': \\'Keyboard\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [920, 865, 941, 927], \\'text\\': \\'=\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [945, 251, 961, 350], \\'text\\': \\'Songs\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 444, 179, 669]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 222, 179, 432]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 681, 179, 990]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 8, 179, 210]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [808, 566, 871, 964]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [899, 203, 969, 390]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [905, 44, 960, 155]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [907, 646, 957, 759]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 902, 110, 982]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [909, 849, 955, 956]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [890, 366, 1000, 633]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 194, 38, 244]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 819, 39, 946]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The search field currently displays \\'|earch\\' (placeholder \\'Search\\' with cursor). This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'Lost in the Echo\\' and then, due to the \\'\\\\n\\', initiate the search for this song. The expected outcome is that the search results for \\'Lost in the Echo\\' will be displayed. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Lost in the Echo\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The search results now display the song \\'Lost in the Echo\\'. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding songs to the playlist. The focused element according to the XML data is \\'Albums\\', which is unexpected, but the search itself worked. The next step is to interact with the search result.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon next to the song \\'Lost in the Echo\\'. The icon is located at approximately [268, 938]. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playlist\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot menu icon (approximate coordinates [268, 938] in the previous screen) next to the song \\'Lost in the Echo\\' was successful. A context menu appeared on the screen, overlaying the search results. This menu provides several options for the selected song, including \\'Add to playlist\\'.

Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playlist\\' (approximate coordinates [436, 697] from the previous screen context) was successful. An \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog appeared, showing options \\'New playlist\\' and \\'Blues Break 567\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Lost in the Echo\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[534,270],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Blues Break 567\\' option in the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog. The text \\'Blues Break 567\\' is visible with bounding box [527, 140, 542, 400].

This action is expected to clear the current search term \\'Lost in the Echo\\' from the search field, allowing for a new search. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'X\\' icon (clear search) was successful. The search term \\'Lost in the Echo\\' was cleared from the search field, and the search field now displays the placeholder \\'Search\\'. The search results area shows \\'No results\\'. This action prepares the interface for searching the next song, \\'Twilight Calling\\', and moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 30: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The icon is located at approximately [268, 938]. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playlist\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot menu icon (approximate coordinates [268, 938] in the previous screen) next to the song \\'Lost in the Echo\\' was successful. A context menu appeared on the screen, overlaying the search results. This menu provides several options for the selected song, including \\'Add to playlist\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding songs to the playlist.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[436,697],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Add to playlist\\' option is currently visible. This action is expected to open a dialog listing available playlists, allowing the selection of \\'Blues Break 567\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playlist\\' (approximate coordinates [436, 697] from the previous screen context) was successful. An \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog appeared, showing options \\'New playlist\\' and \\'Blues Break 567\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Lost in the Echo\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[534,270],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Blues Break 567\\' option in the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog. The text \\'Blues Break 567\\' is visible with bounding box [527, 140, 542, 400]. This action is expected to add the song \\'Lost in the Echo\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist and close the dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Blues Break 567\\' (approximate coordinates [534, 270] from the previous screen context) in the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog was successful. The dialog closed, indicating that the song \\'Lost in the Echo\\' has been added to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon (clear search) located at the top right of the screen, with an approximate bounding box of [73, 907, 108, 979]. This action is expected to clear the current search term \\'Lost in the Echo\\' from the search field, allowing for a new search. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'X\\' icon (clear search) was successful. The search term \\'Lost in the Echo\\' was cleared from the search field, and the search field now displays the placeholder \\'Search\\'. The search results area shows \\'No results\\'. This action prepares the interface for searching the next song, \\'Twilight Calling\\', and moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

This action is expected to focus the search field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing text input. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field (approximate coordinates [88, 234] from the previous screen context) was successful. The search field is now focused, as indicated by the cursor, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen. This prepares the interface for inputting the next song title, \\'Twilight Calling\\', and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.55\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [75, 168, 102, 302], \\'text\\': \\'|earch\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [144, 48, 168, 172], \\'text\\': \\'Songs\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [147, 268, 163, 391], \\'text\\': \\'Artists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [146, 490, 163, 630], \\'text\\': \\'Albums\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [145, 729, 163, 952], \\'text\\': \\'Album artist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [480, 386, 502, 622], \\'text\\': \\'No results\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [778, 694, 808, 918], \\'text\\': \\'Keyboard\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 444, 179, 669]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 222, 179, 432]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 681, 179, 990]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 8, 179, 210]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [760, 565, 823, 966]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 902, 110, 982]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 819, 40, 948]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 194, 38, 244]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"1\", text=\"Search\", resource-id=\"code.name.monkey.retromusic:id/searchView\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"code.name.monkey.retromusic\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[147,148][953,275]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"Search\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then export the playlist to the Downloads directory on the device.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon next to the song \\'Lost in the Echo\\'. The icon is located at approximately [268, 938]. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playlist\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot menu icon (approximate coordinates [268, 938] in the previous screen) next to the song \\'Lost in the Echo\\' was successful. A context menu appeared on the screen, overlaying the search results. This menu provides several options for the selected song, including \\'Add to playlist\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding songs to the playlist.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[436,697],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Add to playlist\\' option is currently visible. This action is expected to open a dialog listing available playlists, allowing the selection of \\'Blues Break 567\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playlist\\' (approximate coordinates [436, 697] from the previous screen context) was successful. An \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog appeared, showing options \\'New playlist\\' and \\'Blues Break 567\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Lost in the Echo\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[534,270],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Blues Break 567\\' option in the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog. The text \\'Blues Break 567\\' is visible with bounding box [527, 140, 542, 400]. This action is expected to add the song \\'Lost in the Echo\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist and close the dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Blues Break 567\\' (approximate coordinates [534, 270] from the previous screen context) in the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog was successful. The dialog closed, indicating that the song \\'Lost in the Echo\\' has been added to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon (clear search) located at the top right of the screen, with an approximate bounding box of [73, 907, 108, 979]. This action is expected to clear the current search term \\'Lost in the Echo\\' from the search field, allowing for a new search. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'X\\' icon (clear search) was successful. The search term \\'Lost in the Echo\\' was cleared from the search field, and the search field now displays the placeholder \\'Search\\'. The search results area shows \\'No results\\'. This action prepares the interface for searching the next song, \\'Twilight Calling\\', and moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field (placeholder \\'Search\\', bounding box approximately [80, 171, 97, 298]) to focus it. This action is expected to focus the search field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing text input. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field (approximate coordinates [88, 234] from the previous screen context) was successful. The search field is now focused, as indicated by the cursor, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen. This prepares the interface for inputting the next song title, \\'Twilight Calling\\', and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 31: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Twilight Calling\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Twilight Calling\\\\n\\' into the focused search field. The search field currently contains the placeholder text \\'Search\\'. This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'Twilight Calling\\' and then simulate pressing enter to initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for \\'Twilight Calling\\' and display the results. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Retro Music App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Retro Music app is open and its main interface is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar.

The \\'Add to playlist\\' option is currently visible. This action is expected to open a dialog listing available playlists, allowing the selection of \\'Blues Break 567\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playlist\\' (approximate coordinates [436, 697] from the previous screen context) was successful. An \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog appeared, showing options \\'New playlist\\' and \\'Blues Break 567\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Lost in the Echo\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[534,270],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Blues Break 567\\' option in the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog. The text \\'Blues Break 567\\' is visible with bounding box [527, 140, 542, 400]. This action is expected to add the song \\'Lost in the Echo\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist and close the dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Blues Break 567\\' (approximate coordinates [534, 270] from the previous screen context) in the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog was successful. The dialog closed, indicating that the song \\'Lost in the Echo\\' has been added to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon (clear search) located at the top right of the screen, with an approximate bounding box of [73, 907, 108, 979]. This action is expected to clear the current search term \\'Lost in the Echo\\' from the search field, allowing for a new search. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'X\\' icon (clear search) was successful. The search term \\'Lost in the Echo\\' was cleared from the search field, and the search field now displays the placeholder \\'Search\\'. The search results area shows \\'No results\\'. This action prepares the interface for searching the next song, \\'Twilight Calling\\', and moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field (placeholder \\'Search\\', bounding box approximately [80, 171, 97, 298]) to focus it. This action is expected to focus the search field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing text input. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field (approximate coordinates [88, 234] from the previous screen context) was successful. The search field is now focused, as indicated by the cursor, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen. This prepares the interface for inputting the next song title, \\'Twilight Calling\\', and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Twilight Calling\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Twilight Calling\\\\n\\' into the focused search field. The search field currently contains the placeholder text \\'Search\\'. This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'Twilight Calling\\' and then simulate pressing enter to initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for \\'Twilight Calling\\' and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Twilight Calling\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and \\'Twilight Calling\\' is now displayed as a search result. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding all specified songs to the playlist.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.56\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [77, 170, 102, 450], \\'text\\': \\'Twilight Calling\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [144, 48, 168, 172], \\'text\\': \\'Songs\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [147, 268, 163, 391], \\'text\\': \\'Artists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [146, 490, 163, 630], \\'text\\': \\'Albums\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [145, 729, 163, 952], \\'text\\': \\'Album artist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [202, 19, 214, 122], \\'text\\': \\'SONG S\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [244, 186, 266, 462], \\'text\\': \\'Twilight Calling\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [272, 188, 288, 289], \\'text\\': \\'Music\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [778, 694, 808, 918], \\'text\\': \\'Keyboard\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 444, 179, 669]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 682, 179, 990]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 222, 179, 431]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 8, 179, 210]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [760, 564, 823, 966]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [73, 906, 108, 979]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [240, 35, 294, 158]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [13, 819, 40, 950]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 37, 243]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [243, 883, 294, 994]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"2\", text=\"Albums\", resource-id=\"code.name.monkey.retromusic:id/chip_albums\", class=\"android.widget.RadioButton\", package=\"code.name.monkey.retromusic\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"true\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"false\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[483,309][719,435]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"Albums\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[436,697],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Add to playlist\\' option is currently visible. This action is expected to open a dialog listing available playlists, allowing the selection of \\'Blues Break 567\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playlist\\' (approximate coordinates [436, 697] from the previous screen context) was successful. An \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog appeared, showing options \\'New playlist\\' and \\'Blues Break 567\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Lost in the Echo\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[534,270],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Blues Break 567\\' option in the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog. The text \\'Blues Break 567\\' is visible with bounding box [527, 140, 542, 400]. This action is expected to add the song \\'Lost in the Echo\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist and close the dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Blues Break 567\\' (approximate coordinates [534, 270] from the previous screen context) in the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog was successful. The dialog closed, indicating that the song \\'Lost in the Echo\\' has been added to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon (clear search) located at the top right of the screen, with an approximate bounding box of [73, 907, 108, 979]. This action is expected to clear the current search term \\'Lost in the Echo\\' from the search field, allowing for a new search. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'X\\' icon (clear search) was successful. The search term \\'Lost in the Echo\\' was cleared from the search field, and the search field now displays the placeholder \\'Search\\'. The search results area shows \\'No results\\'. This action prepares the interface for searching the next song, \\'Twilight Calling\\', and moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field (placeholder \\'Search\\', bounding box approximately [80, 171, 97, 298]) to focus it. This action is expected to focus the search field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing text input. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field (approximate coordinates [88, 234] from the previous screen context) was successful.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[534,270],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Blues Break 567\\' option in the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog. The text \\'Blues Break 567\\' is visible with bounding box [527, 140, 542, 400]. This action is expected to add the song \\'Lost in the Echo\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist and close the dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Blues Break 567\\' (approximate coordinates [534, 270] from the previous screen context) in the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog was successful. The dialog closed, indicating that the song \\'Lost in the Echo\\' has been added to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon (clear search) located at the top right of the screen, with an approximate bounding box of [73, 907, 108, 979]. This action is expected to clear the current search term \\'Lost in the Echo\\' from the search field, allowing for a new search. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'X\\' icon (clear search) was successful. The search term \\'Lost in the Echo\\' was cleared from the search field, and the search field now displays the placeholder \\'Search\\'. The search results area shows \\'No results\\'. This action prepares the interface for searching the next song, \\'Twilight Calling\\', and moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field (placeholder \\'Search\\', bounding box approximately [80, 171, 97, 298]) to focus it. This action is expected to focus the search field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing text input. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field (approximate coordinates [88, 234] from the previous screen context) was successful. The search field is now focused, as indicated by the cursor, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen. This prepares the interface for inputting the next song title, \\'Twilight Calling\\', and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Twilight Calling\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Twilight Calling\\\\n\\' into the focused search field. The search field currently contains the placeholder text \\'Search\\'. This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'Twilight Calling\\' and then simulate pressing enter to initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for \\'Twilight Calling\\' and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Twilight Calling\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and \\'Twilight Calling\\' is now displayed as a search result. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding all specified songs to the playlist.\\n Step 32: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon next to the \\'Twilight Calling\\' song. The icon is located to the right of the song title and has a detected bounding box of [243, 883, 294, 994]. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playlist\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot menu icon next to \\'Twilight Calling\\' (approximate coordinates [268, 938] from the previous screen context, detected at [243, 883, 294, 994] in the first screenshot) was successful. A context menu appeared, overlaying the search results. This menu contains the option \\'Add to playlist\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Twilight Calling\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then export the playlist to the Downloads directory on the device.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[534,270],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Blues Break 567\\' option in the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog. The text \\'Blues Break 567\\' is visible with bounding box [527, 140, 542, 400]. This action is expected to add the song \\'Lost in the Echo\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist and close the dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Blues Break 567\\' (approximate coordinates [534, 270] from the previous screen context) in the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog was successful. The dialog closed, indicating that the song \\'Lost in the Echo\\' has been added to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon (clear search) located at the top right of the screen, with an approximate bounding box of [73, 907, 108, 979]. This action is expected to clear the current search term \\'Lost in the Echo\\' from the search field, allowing for a new search. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'X\\' icon (clear search) was successful. The search term \\'Lost in the Echo\\' was cleared from the search field, and the search field now displays the placeholder \\'Search\\'. The search results area shows \\'No results\\'. This action prepares the interface for searching the next song, \\'Twilight Calling\\', and moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field (placeholder \\'Search\\', bounding box approximately [80, 171, 97, 298]) to focus it. This action is expected to focus the search field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing text input. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field (approximate coordinates [88, 234] from the previous screen context) was successful. The search field is now focused, as indicated by the cursor, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen. This prepares the interface for inputting the next song title, \\'Twilight Calling\\', and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Twilight Calling\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Twilight Calling\\\\n\\' into the focused search field. The search field currently contains the placeholder text \\'Search\\'. This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'Twilight Calling\\' and then simulate pressing enter to initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for \\'Twilight Calling\\' and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Twilight Calling\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and \\'Twilight Calling\\' is now displayed as a search result. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding all specified songs to the playlist.\\n Step 32: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon next to the \\'Twilight Calling\\' song. The icon is located to the right of the song title and has a detected bounding box of [243, 883, 294, 994]. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playlist\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot menu icon next to \\'Twilight Calling\\' (approximate coordinates [268, 938] from the previous screen context, detected at [243, 883, 294, 994] in the first screenshot) was successful. A context menu appeared, overlaying the search results. This menu contains the option \\'Add to playlist\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Twilight Calling\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 33: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[436,697],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu. The text \\'Add to playlist\\' is visible with bounding box [425, 562, 448, 833]. This action is expected to open a dialog where the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist can be selected.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17.

This action is expected to clear the current search term \\'Lost in the Echo\\' from the search field, allowing for a new search. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'X\\' icon (clear search) was successful. The search term \\'Lost in the Echo\\' was cleared from the search field, and the search field now displays the placeholder \\'Search\\'. The search results area shows \\'No results\\'. This action prepares the interface for searching the next song, \\'Twilight Calling\\', and moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

This action is expected to focus the search field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing text input. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field (approximate coordinates [88, 234] from the previous screen context) was successful. The search field is now focused, as indicated by the cursor, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen. This prepares the interface for inputting the next song title, \\'Twilight Calling\\', and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Twilight Calling\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Twilight Calling\\\\n\\' into the focused search field. The search field currently contains the placeholder text \\'Search\\'. This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'Twilight Calling\\' and then simulate pressing enter to initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for \\'Twilight Calling\\' and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Twilight Calling\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and \\'Twilight Calling\\' is now displayed as a search result.

The text \\'Add to playlist\\' is visible with bounding box [425, 562, 448, 833]. This action is expected to open a dialog where the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist can be selected. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playlist\\' (approximate coordinates [436, 697] from the previous screen context, detected at [425, 562, 448, 833] in the first screenshot) was successful. A dialog titled \\'Add to playlist\\' appeared, overlaying the search results. This dialog presents options to add the song to \\'New playlist\\' or the existing \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist.

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then export the playlist to the Downloads directory on the device.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon (clear search) located at the top right of the screen, with an approximate bounding box of [73, 907, 108, 979]. This action is expected to clear the current search term \\'Lost in the Echo\\' from the search field, allowing for a new search. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'X\\' icon (clear search) was successful. The search term \\'Lost in the Echo\\' was cleared from the search field, and the search field now displays the placeholder \\'Search\\'. The search results area shows \\'No results\\'. This action prepares the interface for searching the next song, \\'Twilight Calling\\', and moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field (placeholder \\'Search\\', bounding box approximately [80, 171, 97, 298]) to focus it. This action is expected to focus the search field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing text input. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field (approximate coordinates [88, 234] from the previous screen context) was successful. The search field is now focused, as indicated by the cursor, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen. This prepares the interface for inputting the next song title, \\'Twilight Calling\\', and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Twilight Calling\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Twilight Calling\\\\n\\' into the focused search field. The search field currently contains the placeholder text \\'Search\\'. This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'Twilight Calling\\' and then simulate pressing enter to initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for \\'Twilight Calling\\' and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Twilight Calling\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and \\'Twilight Calling\\' is now displayed as a search result. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding all specified songs to the playlist.\\n Step 32: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon next to the \\'Twilight Calling\\' song. The icon is located to the right of the song title and has a detected bounding box of [243, 883, 294, 994]. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playlist\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot menu icon next to \\'Twilight Calling\\' (approximate coordinates [268, 938] from the previous screen context, detected at [243, 883, 294, 994] in the first screenshot) was successful. A context menu appeared, overlaying the search results. This menu contains the option \\'Add to playlist\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Twilight Calling\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist.\\n Step 33: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[436,697],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu. The text \\'Add to playlist\\' is visible with bounding box [425, 562, 448, 833]. This action is expected to open a dialog where the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist can be selected.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field (placeholder \\'Search\\', bounding box approximately [80, 171, 97, 298]) to focus it. This action is expected to focus the search field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing text input. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field (approximate coordinates [88, 234] from the previous screen context) was successful. The search field is now focused, as indicated by the cursor, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen. This prepares the interface for inputting the next song title, \\'Twilight Calling\\', and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Twilight Calling\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Twilight Calling\\\\n\\' into the focused search field. The search field currently contains the placeholder text \\'Search\\'. This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'Twilight Calling\\' and then simulate pressing enter to initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for \\'Twilight Calling\\' and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Twilight Calling\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and \\'Twilight Calling\\' is now displayed as a search result. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding all specified songs to the playlist.\\n Step 32: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon next to the \\'Twilight Calling\\' song. The icon is located to the right of the song title and has a detected bounding box of [243, 883, 294, 994]. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playlist\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot menu icon next to \\'Twilight Calling\\' (approximate coordinates [268, 938] from the previous screen context, detected at [243, 883, 294, 994] in the first screenshot) was successful. A context menu appeared, overlaying the search results. This menu contains the option \\'Add to playlist\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Twilight Calling\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist.\\n Step 33: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[436,697],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu. The text \\'Add to playlist\\' is visible with bounding box [425, 562, 448, 833]. This action is expected to open a dialog where the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist can be selected. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playlist\\' (approximate coordinates [436, 697] from the previous screen context, detected at [425, 562, 448, 833] in the first screenshot) was successful. A dialog titled \\'Add to playlist\\' appeared, overlaying the search results. This dialog presents options to add the song to \\'New playlist\\' or the existing \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Twilight Calling\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist.\\n Step 34: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[534,270],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'Blues Break 567\\' (text detected at [527, 140, 542, 400]) in the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog. This action is expected to add the song \\'Twilight Calling\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist and close the dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Blues Break 567\\' (approximate coordinates [534, 270] from the previous screen context, detected at [527, 140, 542, 400] in the first screenshot) was successful. The \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog closed, indicating that the song \\'Twilight Calling\\' has been added to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. This action completed the task of adding all specified songs to the playlist, thus completing the active subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.58\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [77, 170, 102, 450], \\'text\\': \\'Twilight Calling\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [144, 48, 168, 172], \\'text\\': \\'Songs\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [147, 268, 163, 391], \\'text\\': \\'Artists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [146, 490, 163, 630], \\'text\\': \\'Albums\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [145, 729, 163, 952], \\'text\\': \\'Album artist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [202, 19, 214, 122], \\'text\\': \\'SONG S\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [244, 186, 266, 462], \\'text\\': \\'Twilight Calling\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [272, 188, 288, 289], \\'text\\': \\'Music\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [826, 696, 856, 919], \\'text\\': \\'Keyboard\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [920, 865, 941, 927], \\'text\\': \\'=\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [945, 251, 961, 350], \\'text\\': \\'Songs\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 444, 179, 669]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 681, 179, 990]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 222, 179, 431]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 8, 179, 210]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [807, 567, 870, 964]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [899, 200, 969, 394]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [906, 46, 960, 153]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [907, 647, 960, 760]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [242, 882, 294, 994]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [73, 906, 108, 979]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [240, 33, 294, 157]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [889, 366, 1000, 634]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 37, 243]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [909, 848, 956, 956]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 819, 39, 947]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then export the playlist to the Downloads directory on the device.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field (placeholder \\'Search\\', bounding box approximately [80, 171, 97, 298]) to focus it. This action is expected to focus the search field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing text input. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field (approximate coordinates [88, 234] from the previous screen context) was successful. The search field is now focused, as indicated by the cursor, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen. This prepares the interface for inputting the next song title, \\'Twilight Calling\\', and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Twilight Calling\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Twilight Calling\\\\n\\' into the focused search field. The search field currently contains the placeholder text \\'Search\\'. This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'Twilight Calling\\' and then simulate pressing enter to initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for \\'Twilight Calling\\' and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Twilight Calling\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and \\'Twilight Calling\\' is now displayed as a search result. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding all specified songs to the playlist.\\n Step 32: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon next to the \\'Twilight Calling\\' song. The icon is located to the right of the song title and has a detected bounding box of [243, 883, 294, 994]. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playlist\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot menu icon next to \\'Twilight Calling\\' (approximate coordinates [268, 938] from the previous screen context, detected at [243, 883, 294, 994] in the first screenshot) was successful. A context menu appeared, overlaying the search results. This menu contains the option \\'Add to playlist\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Twilight Calling\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist.\\n Step 33: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[436,697],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu. The text \\'Add to playlist\\' is visible with bounding box [425, 562, 448, 833]. This action is expected to open a dialog where the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist can be selected. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playlist\\' (approximate coordinates [436, 697] from the previous screen context, detected at [425, 562, 448, 833] in the first screenshot) was successful. A dialog titled \\'Add to playlist\\' appeared, overlaying the search results. This dialog presents options to add the song to \\'New playlist\\' or the existing \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Twilight Calling\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist.\\n Step 34: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[534,270],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'Blues Break 567\\' (text detected at [527, 140, 542, 400]) in the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog. This action is expected to add the song \\'Twilight Calling\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist and close the dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Blues Break 567\\' (approximate coordinates [534, 270] from the previous screen context, detected at [527, 140, 542, 400] in the first screenshot) was successful. The \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog closed, indicating that the song \\'Twilight Calling\\' has been added to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. This action completed the task of adding all specified songs to the playlist, thus completing the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 35: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,942],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon at the top right of the screen (bounding box [73, 906, 108, 979]) to clear the current search for \\'Twilight Calling\\'. This is expected to clear the search field and return to the song list or an empty search interface.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right.

Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playlist\\' (approximate coordinates [436, 697] from the previous screen context, detected at [425, 562, 448, 833] in the first screenshot) was successful. A dialog titled \\'Add to playlist\\' appeared, overlaying the search results. This dialog presents options to add the song to \\'New playlist\\' or the existing \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Twilight Calling\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist.\\n Step 34: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

This is expected to clear the search field and return to the song list or an empty search interface. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'X\\' icon (approximate coordinates [90, 942] from the previous screen context, detected at [73, 906, 108, 979] in the first screenshot) successfully cleared the search query \\'Twilight Calling\\'. The screen now displays \\'No results\\' and the title \\'Search\\', indicating an empty search state. This action was a necessary cleanup step after adding the last song and brings the agent closer to the next phase of verifying the playlist content.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15:59\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [80, 171, 97, 298], \\'text\\': \\'Search\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [144, 48, 168, 172], \\'text\\': \\'Songs\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [147, 268, 163, 391], \\'text\\': \\'Artists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [146, 490, 163, 630], \\'text\\': \\'Albums\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [145, 729, 163, 952], \\'text\\': \\'Album artist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [505, 386, 526, 622], \\'text\\': \\'No results\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [826, 696, 856, 919], \\'text\\': \\'Keyboard\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [920, 865, 941, 927], \\'text\\': \\'=\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [945, 251, 961, 350], \\'text\\': \\'Songs\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 444, 179, 669]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 221, 179, 432]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 681, 179, 990]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 8, 179, 210]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [808, 566, 871, 964]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [899, 203, 969, 390]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [905, 44, 960, 155]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [907, 646, 957, 759]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 902, 110, 982]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 819, 40, 948]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [909, 849, 955, 956]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [890, 367, 1000, 633]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 194, 38, 244]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then export the playlist to the Downloads directory on the device.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Twilight Calling\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Twilight Calling\\\\n\\' into the focused search field. The search field currently contains the placeholder text \\'Search\\'. This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'Twilight Calling\\' and then simulate pressing enter to initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for \\'Twilight Calling\\' and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Twilight Calling\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and \\'Twilight Calling\\' is now displayed as a search result. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding all specified songs to the playlist.\\n Step 32: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon next to the \\'Twilight Calling\\' song. The icon is located to the right of the song title and has a detected bounding box of [243, 883, 294, 994]. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playlist\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot menu icon next to \\'Twilight Calling\\' (approximate coordinates [268, 938] from the previous screen context, detected at [243, 883, 294, 994] in the first screenshot) was successful. A context menu appeared, overlaying the search results. This menu contains the option \\'Add to playlist\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Twilight Calling\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist.\\n Step 33: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[436,697],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu. The text \\'Add to playlist\\' is visible with bounding box [425, 562, 448, 833]. This action is expected to open a dialog where the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist can be selected. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playlist\\' (approximate coordinates [436, 697] from the previous screen context, detected at [425, 562, 448, 833] in the first screenshot) was successful. A dialog titled \\'Add to playlist\\' appeared, overlaying the search results. This dialog presents options to add the song to \\'New playlist\\' or the existing \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Twilight Calling\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist.\\n Step 34: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[534,270],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'Blues Break 567\\' (text detected at [527, 140, 542, 400]) in the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog. This action is expected to add the song \\'Twilight Calling\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist and close the dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Blues Break 567\\' (approximate coordinates [534, 270] from the previous screen context, detected at [527, 140, 542, 400] in the first screenshot) was successful. The \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog closed, indicating that the song \\'Twilight Calling\\' has been added to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. This action completed the task of adding all specified songs to the playlist, thus completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 35: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,942],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon at the top right of the screen (bounding box [73, 906, 108, 979]) to clear the current search for \\'Twilight Calling\\'. This is expected to clear the search field and return to the song list or an empty search interface. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'X\\' icon (approximate coordinates [90, 942] from the previous screen context, detected at [73, 906, 108, 979] in the first screenshot) successfully cleared the search query \\'Twilight Calling\\'. The screen now displays \\'No results\\' and the title \\'Search\\', indicating an empty search state. This action was a necessary cleanup step after adding the last song and brings the agent closer to the next phase of verifying the playlist content.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 36: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Twilight Calling\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist.\\n Step 33: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[436,697],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu. The text \\'Add to playlist\\' is visible with bounding box [425, 562, 448, 833]. This action is expected to open a dialog where the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist can be selected. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playlist\\' (approximate coordinates [436, 697] from the previous screen context, detected at [425, 562, 448, 833] in the first screenshot) was successful. A dialog titled \\'Add to playlist\\' appeared, overlaying the search results. This dialog presents options to add the song to \\'New playlist\\' or the existing \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Twilight Calling\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist.\\n Step 34: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[534,270],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'Blues Break 567\\' (text detected at [527, 140, 542, 400]) in the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog. This action is expected to add the song \\'Twilight Calling\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist and close the dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Blues Break 567\\' (approximate coordinates [534, 270] from the previous screen context, detected at [527, 140, 542, 400] in the first screenshot) was successful. The \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog closed, indicating that the song \\'Twilight Calling\\' has been added to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. This action completed the task of adding all specified songs to the playlist, thus completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 35: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,942],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon at the top right of the screen (bounding box [73, 906, 108, 979]) to clear the current search for \\'Twilight Calling\\'. This is expected to clear the search field and return to the song list or an empty search interface. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'X\\' icon (approximate coordinates [90, 942] from the previous screen context, detected at [73, 906, 108, 979] in the first screenshot) successfully cleared the search query \\'Twilight Calling\\'. The screen now displays \\'No results\\' and the title \\'Search\\', indicating an empty search state. This action was a necessary cleanup step after adding the last song and brings the agent closer to the next phase of verifying the playlist content.\\n Step 36: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,66],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon at the top left of the screen (estimated coordinates [88, 66]). This action is expected to navigate back from the current search screen to the previous screen, which should be the main \\'Songs\\' view or the \\'Playlists\\' view. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (estimated coordinates [88, 66]) was successful. The application navigated from the search screen (which showed \\'No results\\') to the \\'Songs\\' screen, which lists various songs. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by returning to a main navigation point from which the \\'Playlists\\' section can be accessed.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then export the playlist to the Downloads directory on the device.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 32: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon next to the \\'Twilight Calling\\' song. The icon is located to the right of the song title and has a detected bounding box of [243, 883, 294, 994]. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playlist\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot menu icon next to \\'Twilight Calling\\' (approximate coordinates [268, 938] from the previous screen context, detected at [243, 883, 294, 994] in the first screenshot) was successful. A context menu appeared, overlaying the search results. This menu contains the option \\'Add to playlist\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Twilight Calling\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist.\\n Step 33: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[436,697],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu. The text \\'Add to playlist\\' is visible with bounding box [425, 562, 448, 833]. This action is expected to open a dialog where the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist can be selected. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playlist\\' (approximate coordinates [436, 697] from the previous screen context, detected at [425, 562, 448, 833] in the first screenshot) was successful. A dialog titled \\'Add to playlist\\' appeared, overlaying the search results. This dialog presents options to add the song to \\'New playlist\\' or the existing \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Twilight Calling\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist.\\n Step 34: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[534,270],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'Blues Break 567\\' (text detected at [527, 140, 542, 400]) in the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog. This action is expected to add the song \\'Twilight Calling\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist and close the dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Blues Break 567\\' (approximate coordinates [534, 270] from the previous screen context, detected at [527, 140, 542, 400] in the first screenshot) was successful. The \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog closed, indicating that the song \\'Twilight Calling\\' has been added to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. This action completed the task of adding all specified songs to the playlist, thus completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 35: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,942],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon at the top right of the screen (bounding box [73, 906, 108, 979]) to clear the current search for \\'Twilight Calling\\'. This is expected to clear the search field and return to the song list or an empty search interface. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'X\\' icon (approximate coordinates [90, 942] from the previous screen context, detected at [73, 906, 108, 979] in the first screenshot) successfully cleared the search query \\'Twilight Calling\\'. The screen now displays \\'No results\\' and the title \\'Search\\', indicating an empty search state. This action was a necessary cleanup step after adding the last song and brings the agent closer to the next phase of verifying the playlist content.\\n Step 36: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,66],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon at the top left of the screen (estimated coordinates [88, 66]). This action is expected to navigate back from the current search screen to the previous screen, which should be the main \\'Songs\\' view or the \\'Playlists\\' view. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (estimated coordinates [88, 66]) was successful. The application navigated from the search screen (which showed \\'No results\\') to the \\'Songs\\' screen, which lists various songs. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by returning to a main navigation point from which the \\'Playlists\\' section can be accessed.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 37: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17.

The text \\'Add to playlist\\' is visible with bounding box [425, 562, 448, 833]. This action is expected to open a dialog where the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist can be selected. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playlist\\' (approximate coordinates [436, 697] from the previous screen context, detected at [425, 562, 448, 833] in the first screenshot) was successful. A dialog titled \\'Add to playlist\\' appeared, overlaying the search results. This dialog presents options to add the song to \\'New playlist\\' or the existing \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Twilight Calling\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist.\\n Step 34: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[534,270],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'Blues Break 567\\' (text detected at [527, 140, 542, 400]) in the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog. This action is expected to add the song \\'Twilight Calling\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist and close the dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Blues Break 567\\' (approximate coordinates [534, 270] from the previous screen context, detected at [527, 140, 542, 400] in the first screenshot) was successful. The \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog closed, indicating that the song \\'Twilight Calling\\' has been added to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. This action completed the task of adding all specified songs to the playlist, thus completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 35: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,942],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon at the top right of the screen (bounding box [73, 906, 108, 979]) to clear the current search for \\'Twilight Calling\\'. This is expected to clear the search field and return to the song list or an empty search interface. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'X\\' icon (approximate coordinates [90, 942] from the previous screen context, detected at [73, 906, 108, 979] in the first screenshot) successfully cleared the search query \\'Twilight Calling\\'. The screen now displays \\'No results\\' and the title \\'Search\\', indicating an empty search state. This action was a necessary cleanup step after adding the last song and brings the agent closer to the next phase of verifying the playlist content.\\n Step 36: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,66],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon at the top left of the screen (estimated coordinates [88, 66]). This action is expected to navigate back from the current search screen to the previous screen, which should be the main \\'Songs\\' view or the \\'Playlists\\' view. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (estimated coordinates [88, 66]) was successful. The application navigated from the search screen (which showed \\'No results\\') to the \\'Songs\\' screen, which lists various songs. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by returning to a main navigation point from which the \\'Playlists\\' section can be accessed.\\n Step 37: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[933,896],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab icon (three horizontal lines) in the bottom navigation bar, located at approximately [933, 896]. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'Playlists\\' screen, where the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist can be found and opened. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab icon (approximate coordinates [933, 896]) was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Songs\\' screen to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. The \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist is now visible. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of verifying and reordering songs in the playlist.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'16.00\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [76, 397, 107, 609], \\'text\\': \\'Playlists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [192, 135, 288, 360], \\'text\\': \\'0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [358, 41, 377, 337], \\'text\\': \\'Blues Break 567\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [385, 41, 406, 300], \\'text\\': \\'3 Songs 13:17\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [945, 837, 962, 967], \\'text\\': \\'Playlists\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [183, 126, 293, 375]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [899, 812, 972, 987]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [905, 236, 959, 362]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [901, 634, 972, 768]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [345, 7, 420, 491]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [907, 50, 958, 153]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [906, 449, 959, 558]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 918, 109, 978]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[436,697],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playlist\\' option in the context menu. The text \\'Add to playlist\\' is visible with bounding box [425, 562, 448, 833]. This action is expected to open a dialog where the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist can be selected. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playlist\\' (approximate coordinates [436, 697] from the previous screen context, detected at [425, 562, 448, 833] in the first screenshot) was successful. A dialog titled \\'Add to playlist\\' appeared, overlaying the search results. This dialog presents options to add the song to \\'New playlist\\' or the existing \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Twilight Calling\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist.\\n Step 34: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[534,270],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'Blues Break 567\\' (text detected at [527, 140, 542, 400]) in the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog. This action is expected to add the song \\'Twilight Calling\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist and close the dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Blues Break 567\\' (approximate coordinates [534, 270] from the previous screen context, detected at [527, 140, 542, 400] in the first screenshot) was successful. The \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog closed, indicating that the song \\'Twilight Calling\\' has been added to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. This action completed the task of adding all specified songs to the playlist, thus completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 35: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,942],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon at the top right of the screen (bounding box [73, 906, 108, 979]) to clear the current search for \\'Twilight Calling\\'. This is expected to clear the search field and return to the song list or an empty search interface. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'X\\' icon (approximate coordinates [90, 942] from the previous screen context, detected at [73, 906, 108, 979] in the first screenshot) successfully cleared the search query \\'Twilight Calling\\'. The screen now displays \\'No results\\' and the title \\'Search\\', indicating an empty search state. This action was a necessary cleanup step after adding the last song and brings the agent closer to the next phase of verifying the playlist content.\\n Step 36: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,66],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon at the top left of the screen (estimated coordinates [88, 66]). This action is expected to navigate back from the current search screen to the previous screen, which should be the main \\'Songs\\' view or the \\'Playlists\\' view. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (estimated coordinates [88, 66]) was successful. The application navigated from the search screen (which showed \\'No results\\') to the \\'Songs\\' screen, which lists various songs. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by returning to a main navigation point from which the \\'Playlists\\' section can be accessed.\\n Step 37: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[933,896],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab icon (three horizontal lines) in the bottom navigation bar, located at approximately [933, 896]. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'Playlists\\' screen, where the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist can be found and opened. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab icon (approximate coordinates [933, 896]) was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Songs\\' screen to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. The \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist is now visible. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of verifying and reordering songs in the playlist.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 38: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to add the song \\'Twilight Calling\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist and close the dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Blues Break 567\\' (approximate coordinates [534, 270] from the previous screen context, detected at [527, 140, 542, 400] in the first screenshot) was successful. The \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog closed, indicating that the song \\'Twilight Calling\\' has been added to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. This action completed the task of adding all specified songs to the playlist, thus completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 35: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,942],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon at the top right of the screen (bounding box [73, 906, 108, 979]) to clear the current search for \\'Twilight Calling\\'.

Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (estimated coordinates [88, 66]) was successful. The application navigated from the search screen (which showed \\'No results\\') to the \\'Songs\\' screen, which lists various songs. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by returning to a main navigation point from which the \\'Playlists\\' section can be accessed.\\n Step 37: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

This action is expected to navigate to the playlist view, showing the songs within it. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist (approximate coordinates [367, 189] from the previous screen context, text detected at [358, 41, 377, 337] in the first screenshot) was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the individual playlist view for \\'Blues Break 567\\'. The screen now displays the songs within this playlist: \\'Chasing Shadows\\', \\'Lost in the Echo\\', and \\'Twilight Calling\\', in that order. This action allowed for the verification of the song order, which was found to be correct, thus completing a key step in the active subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'16.00\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 428, 172, 903], \\'text\\': \\'Blues Break\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [183, 433, 218, 580], \\'text\\': \\'567\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [247, 430, 260, 453], \\'text\\': \\'3\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [244, 452, 265, 687], \\'text\\': \\'Songs 13:17\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [374, 229, 422, 558], \\'text\\': \\'Chasing Shadows Mohammad\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [449, 235, 467, 521], \\'text\\': \\'Lost in the Echo\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [478, 235, 493, 301], \\'text\\': \\'Ana\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [519, 232, 542, 510], \\'text\\': \\'Twilight Calling\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [548, 235, 564, 349], \\'text\\': \\'Amelia\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [163, 123, 245, 311]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [285, 782, 344, 918]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [437, 77, 508, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [364, 74, 438, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [521, 7, 567, 96]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [376, 6, 426, 96]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [528, 908, 557, 982]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [386, 901, 416, 985]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [451, 7, 495, 92]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then export the playlist to the Downloads directory on the device.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 34: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[534,270],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'Blues Break 567\\' (text detected at [527, 140, 542, 400]) in the \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog. This action is expected to add the song \\'Twilight Calling\\' to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist and close the dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Blues Break 567\\' (approximate coordinates [534, 270] from the previous screen context, detected at [527, 140, 542, 400] in the first screenshot) was successful. The \\'Add to playlist\\' dialog closed, indicating that the song \\'Twilight Calling\\' has been added to the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist. This action completed the task of adding all specified songs to the playlist, thus completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 35: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,942],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon at the top right of the screen (bounding box [73, 906, 108, 979]) to clear the current search for \\'Twilight Calling\\'. This is expected to clear the search field and return to the song list or an empty search interface. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'X\\' icon (approximate coordinates [90, 942] from the previous screen context, detected at [73, 906, 108, 979] in the first screenshot) successfully cleared the search query \\'Twilight Calling\\'. The screen now displays \\'No results\\' and the title \\'Search\\', indicating an empty search state. This action was a necessary cleanup step after adding the last song and brings the agent closer to the next phase of verifying the playlist content.\\n Step 36: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

This action is expected to navigate back from the current search screen to the previous screen, which should be the main \\'Songs\\' view or the \\'Playlists\\' view. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (estimated coordinates [88, 66]) was successful. The application navigated from the search screen (which showed \\'No results\\') to the \\'Songs\\' screen, which lists various songs. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by returning to a main navigation point from which the \\'Playlists\\' section can be accessed.\\n Step 37: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[933,896],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab icon (three horizontal lines) in the bottom navigation bar, located at approximately [933, 896]. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'Playlists\\' screen, where the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist can be found and opened. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab icon (approximate coordinates [933, 896]) was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Songs\\' screen to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. The \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist is now visible. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of verifying and reordering songs in the playlist.\\n Step 38: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[367,189],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist (text detected at [358, 41, 377, 337]) to open it. This action is expected to navigate to the playlist view, showing the songs within it. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist (approximate coordinates [367, 189] from the previous screen context, text detected at [358, 41, 377, 337] in the first screenshot) was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the individual playlist view for \\'Blues Break 567\\'. The screen now displays the songs within this playlist: \\'Chasing Shadows\\', \\'Lost in the Echo\\', and \\'Twilight Calling\\', in that order. This action allowed for the verification of the song order, which was found to be correct, thus completing a key step in the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 39: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,942],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon at the top right of the screen (bounding box [73, 906, 108, 979]) to clear the current search for \\'Twilight Calling\\'. This is expected to clear the search field and return to the song list or an empty search interface. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'X\\' icon (approximate coordinates [90, 942] from the previous screen context, detected at [73, 906, 108, 979] in the first screenshot) successfully cleared the search query \\'Twilight Calling\\'. The screen now displays \\'No results\\' and the title \\'Search\\', indicating an empty search state. This action was a necessary cleanup step after adding the last song and brings the agent closer to the next phase of verifying the playlist content.\\n Step 36: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,66],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon at the top left of the screen (estimated coordinates [88, 66]). This action is expected to navigate back from the current search screen to the previous screen, which should be the main \\'Songs\\' view or the \\'Playlists\\' view. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (estimated coordinates [88, 66]) was successful. The application navigated from the search screen (which showed \\'No results\\') to the \\'Songs\\' screen, which lists various songs. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by returning to a main navigation point from which the \\'Playlists\\' section can be accessed.\\n Step 37: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[933,896],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab icon (three horizontal lines) in the bottom navigation bar, located at approximately [933, 896]. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'Playlists\\' screen, where the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist can be found and opened. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab icon (approximate coordinates [933, 896]) was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Songs\\' screen to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. The \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist is now visible. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of verifying and reordering songs in the playlist.\\n Step 38: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[367,189],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist (text detected at [358, 41, 377, 337]) to open it. This action is expected to navigate to the playlist view, showing the songs within it. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist (approximate coordinates [367, 189] from the previous screen context, text detected at [358, 41, 377, 337] in the first screenshot) was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the individual playlist view for \\'Blues Break 567\\'. The screen now displays the songs within this playlist: \\'Chasing Shadows\\', \\'Lost in the Echo\\', and \\'Twilight Calling\\', in that order. This action allowed for the verification of the song order, which was found to be correct, thus completing a key step in the active subgoal.\\n Step 39: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approximately [88, 945]). This action is expected to open a context menu containing options for the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist, hopefully including an \\'Export playlist\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot menu icon (approximate coordinates [88, 945]) at the top right of the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist screen was successful. A context menu popped up, displaying the following options: \"Play\", \"Play next\", \"Add to playing queue\", \"Add to playlist\", \"Rename\", \"Delete\", and \"Save as file\". This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the \"Save as file\" option is the one needed to export the playlist.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 131], \\'text\\': \\'16.01\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [134, 431, 169, 725], \\'text\\': \\'BI Play next\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [183, 433, 220, 946], \\'text\\': \\'56 Add to playing queue\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [247, 429, 271, 825], \\'text\\': \\'3 Son Add to playlist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [301, 551, 318, 704], \\'text\\': \\'Rename\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [353, 551, 371, 673], \\'text\\': \\'Delete\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [375, 229, 423, 767], \\'text\\': \\'Chasing Shadov Mohammad Save as file\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [449, 235, 467, 521], \\'text\\': \\'Lost in the Echo\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [478, 235, 493, 301], \\'text\\': \\'Ana\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [519, 232, 542, 510], \\'text\\': \\'Twilight Calling\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [548, 235, 564, 349], \\'text\\': \\'Amelia\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [88, 545, 113, 638], \\'text\\': \\'Play\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [164, 121, 245, 314]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [520, 3, 567, 99]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [438, 87, 508, 999]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [127, 511, 179, 992]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [448, 5, 497, 95]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [377, 4, 426, 97]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 194, 37, 243]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [527, 900, 557, 986]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [179, 515, 231, 988]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then export the playlist to the Downloads directory on the device.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 35: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,942],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon at the top right of the screen (bounding box [73, 906, 108, 979]) to clear the current search for \\'Twilight Calling\\'. This is expected to clear the search field and return to the song list or an empty search interface. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'X\\' icon (approximate coordinates [90, 942] from the previous screen context, detected at [73, 906, 108, 979] in the first screenshot) successfully cleared the search query \\'Twilight Calling\\'. The screen now displays \\'No results\\' and the title \\'Search\\', indicating an empty search state. This action was a necessary cleanup step after adding the last song and brings the agent closer to the next phase of verifying the playlist content.\\n Step 36: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,66],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon at the top left of the screen (estimated coordinates [88, 66]). This action is expected to navigate back from the current search screen to the previous screen, which should be the main \\'Songs\\' view or the \\'Playlists\\' view. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (estimated coordinates [88, 66]) was successful. The application navigated from the search screen (which showed \\'No results\\') to the \\'Songs\\' screen, which lists various songs. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by returning to a main navigation point from which the \\'Playlists\\' section can be accessed.\\n Step 37: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[933,896],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab icon (three horizontal lines) in the bottom navigation bar, located at approximately [933, 896]. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'Playlists\\' screen, where the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist can be found and opened. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab icon (approximate coordinates [933, 896]) was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Songs\\' screen to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. The \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist is now visible. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of verifying and reordering songs in the playlist.\\n Step 38: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[367,189],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist (text detected at [358, 41, 377, 337]) to open it. This action is expected to navigate to the playlist view, showing the songs within it. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist (approximate coordinates [367, 189] from the previous screen context, text detected at [358, 41, 377, 337] in the first screenshot) was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the individual playlist view for \\'Blues Break 567\\'. The screen now displays the songs within this playlist: \\'Chasing Shadows\\', \\'Lost in the Echo\\', and \\'Twilight Calling\\', in that order. This action allowed for the verification of the song order, which was found to be correct, thus completing a key step in the active subgoal.\\n Step 39: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approximately [88, 945]). This action is expected to open a context menu containing options for the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist, hopefully including an \\'Export playlist\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot menu icon (approximate coordinates [88, 945]) at the top right of the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist screen was successful. A context menu popped up, displaying the following options: \"Play\", \"Play next\", \"Add to playing queue\", \"Add to playlist\", \"Rename\", \"Delete\", and \"Save as file\". This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the \"Save as file\" option is the one needed to export the playlist.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 40: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[399,612],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Save as file\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Save as file\\' option is the last item in the menu, located at approximately [399, 612]. This action is expected to initiate the playlist export process, possibly by opening a file save dialog or directly saving the file to a default location. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Retro Music App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Retro Music app is open and its main interface is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to navigate back from the current search screen to the previous screen, which should be the main \\'Songs\\' view or the \\'Playlists\\' view. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (estimated coordinates [88, 66]) was successful. The application navigated from the search screen (which showed \\'No results\\') to the \\'Songs\\' screen, which lists various songs. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by returning to a main navigation point from which the \\'Playlists\\' section can be accessed.\\n Step 37: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[933,896],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab icon (three horizontal lines) in the bottom navigation bar, located at approximately [933, 896]. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'Playlists\\' screen, where the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist can be found and opened. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab icon (approximate coordinates [933, 896]) was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Songs\\' screen to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. The \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist is now visible. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of verifying and reordering songs in the playlist.\\n Step 38: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[367,189],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist (text detected at [358, 41, 377, 337]) to open it. This action is expected to navigate to the playlist view, showing the songs within it. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist (approximate coordinates [367, 189] from the previous screen context, text detected at [358, 41, 377, 337] in the first screenshot) was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the individual playlist view for \\'Blues Break 567\\'. The screen now displays the songs within this playlist: \\'Chasing Shadows\\', \\'Lost in the Echo\\', and \\'Twilight Calling\\', in that order. This action allowed for the verification of the song order, which was found to be correct, thus completing a key step in the active subgoal.\\n Step 39: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approximately [88, 945]). This action is expected to open a context menu containing options for the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist, hopefully including an \\'Export playlist\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot menu icon (approximate coordinates [88, 945]) at the top right of the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist screen was successful. A context menu popped up, displaying the following options: \"Play\", \"Play next\", \"Add to playing queue\", \"Add to playlist\", \"Rename\", \"Delete\", and \"Save as file\". This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the \"Save as file\" option is the one needed to export the playlist.\\n Step 40: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[399,612],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Save as file\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Save as file\\' option is the last item in the menu, located at approximately [399, 612]. This action is expected to initiate the playlist export process, possibly by opening a file save dialog or directly saving the file to a default location. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Save as file\\' (approximate coordinates [399, 612]) was successful. The application navigated from the playlist context menu to a file saving screen titled \\'Downloads\\'. A text field at the bottom of the screen is pre-filled with the playlist name \\'Blues Break 567\\', and a \\'SAVE\\' button is present. This action brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of exporting the playlist.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 137], \\'text\\': \\'16.04\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 175, 91, 425], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [126, 55, 142, 232], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [186, 57, 200, 312], \\'text\\': \\'Files in Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [556, 417, 576, 583], \\'text\\': \\'No items\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [938, 182, 958, 498], \\'text\\': \\'Blues Break 567\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [940, 811, 956, 910], \\'text\\': \\'SAVE\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [373, 345, 475, 655]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [926, 749, 969, 968]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [927, 11, 972, 121]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 194, 38, 245]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 785, 94, 861]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 21, 39, 207]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [11, 814, 40, 953]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [125, 55, 143, 233]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [46, 117, 96, 413]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then export the playlist to the Downloads directory on the device.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 36: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,66],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon at the top left of the screen (estimated coordinates [88, 66]). This action is expected to navigate back from the current search screen to the previous screen, which should be the main \\'Songs\\' view or the \\'Playlists\\' view. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (estimated coordinates [88, 66]) was successful. The application navigated from the search screen (which showed \\'No results\\') to the \\'Songs\\' screen, which lists various songs. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by returning to a main navigation point from which the \\'Playlists\\' section can be accessed.\\n Step 37: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[933,896],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab icon (three horizontal lines) in the bottom navigation bar, located at approximately [933, 896]. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'Playlists\\' screen, where the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist can be found and opened. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab icon (approximate coordinates [933, 896]) was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Songs\\' screen to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. The \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist is now visible. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of verifying and reordering songs in the playlist.\\n Step 38: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[367,189],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist (text detected at [358, 41, 377, 337]) to open it. This action is expected to navigate to the playlist view, showing the songs within it. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist (approximate coordinates [367, 189] from the previous screen context, text detected at [358, 41, 377, 337] in the first screenshot) was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the individual playlist view for \\'Blues Break 567\\'. The screen now displays the songs within this playlist: \\'Chasing Shadows\\', \\'Lost in the Echo\\', and \\'Twilight Calling\\', in that order. This action allowed for the verification of the song order, which was found to be correct, thus completing a key step in the active subgoal.\\n Step 39: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,945],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approximately [88, 945]). This action is expected to open a context menu containing options for the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist, hopefully including an \\'Export playlist\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dot menu icon (approximate coordinates [88, 945]) at the top right of the \\'Blues Break 567\\' playlist screen was successful. A context menu popped up, displaying the following options: \"Play\", \"Play next\", \"Add to playing queue\", \"Add to playlist\", \"Rename\", \"Delete\", and \"Save as file\". This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the \"Save as file\" option is the one needed to export the playlist.\\n Step 40: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[399,612],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Save as file\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Save as file\\' option is the last item in the menu, located at approximately [399, 612]. This action is expected to initiate the playlist export process, possibly by opening a file save dialog or directly saving the file to a default location. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Save as file\\' (approximate coordinates [399, 612]) was successful. The application navigated from the playlist context menu to a file saving screen titled \\'Downloads\\'. A text field at the bottom of the screen is pre-filled with the playlist name \\'Blues Break 567\\', and a \\'SAVE\\' button is present. This action brought the agent significantly closer to completing the active subgoal of exporting the playlist.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 41: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[948,860],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button (text \\'SAVE\\' detected at [940, 811, 956, 910], approximate center [948, 860]) to save the playlist file \\'Blues Break 567\\' to the Downloads directory. This action is expected to complete the export process.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",
