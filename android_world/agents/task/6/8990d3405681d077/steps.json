Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [123, 46, 147, 306], \\'text\\': \\'Sun; Oct 15\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 336, 722, 431], \\'text\\': \\'Gmail\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 561, 722, 676], \\'text\\': \\'Photos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [704, 781, 722, 921], \\'text\\': \\'YouTube\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [775, 295, 872, 709], \\'text\\': \\'0 (9\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 72, 855, 232]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [788, 765, 856, 929]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 535, 858, 706]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [628, 537, 729, 694]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 299, 856, 466]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 764, 728, 927]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 299, 730, 463]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [900, 701, 948, 795]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [892, 801, 952, 924]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is taken to find and open the \\'Calendar\\' app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, which is to open the \\'Calendar\\' app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[380,836],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Calendar\\' app icon (the one with \\'15\\' on it, located at approximately [380, 836]) to open the Simple Calendar Pro application. The icon is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Calendar\\' icon at approximately [380, 836] resulted in opening the \\'Google Calendar\\' app, as evidenced by the welcome screen in the second screenshot. This was not the intended \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' app. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal and was a failure.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.35\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [403, 440, 448, 562], \\'text\\': \\'31\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [664, 272, 697, 730], \\'text\\': \\'Google Calendar\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [715, 249, 737, 753], \\'text\\': \\'Make the most of every day.\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The event should last for 30 mins.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 2 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the middle of the screen (start_point: [900, 500]) towards the top (end_point: [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is taken to find and open the \\'Calendar\\' app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, which is to open the \\'Calendar\\' app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[380,836],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Calendar\\' app icon (the one with \\'15\\' on it, located at approximately [380, 836]) to open the Simple Calendar Pro application. The icon is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Calendar\\' icon at approximately [380, 836] resulted in opening the \\'Google Calendar\\' app, as evidenced by the welcome screen in the second screenshot. This was not the intended \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' app. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal and was a failure.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 2: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button to close the \\'Google Calendar\\' app and return to the previous screen, which should be the app drawer. The current screen is the welcome screen of Google Calendar.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is taken to find and open the \\'Calendar\\' app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, which is to open the \\'Calendar\\' app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[380,836],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Calendar\\' app icon (the one with \\'15\\' on it, located at approximately [380, 836]) to open the Simple Calendar Pro application. The icon is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Calendar\\' icon at approximately [380, 836] resulted in opening the \\'Google Calendar\\' app, as evidenced by the welcome screen in the second screenshot. This was not the intended \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' app. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal and was a failure.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button to close the \\'Google Calendar\\' app and return to the previous screen, which should be the app drawer. The current screen is the welcome screen of Google Calendar. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button successfully closed the \\'Google Calendar\\' app and returned the view to the app drawer. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as it allows for another attempt to open the correct \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' app.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The event should last for 30 mins.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 3 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the middle of the screen (start_point: [900, 500]) towards the top (end_point: [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is taken to find and open the \\'Calendar\\' app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, which is to open the \\'Calendar\\' app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[380,836],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Calendar\\' app icon (the one with \\'15\\' on it, located at approximately [380, 836]) to open the Simple Calendar Pro application. The icon is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Calendar\\' icon at approximately [380, 836] resulted in opening the \\'Google Calendar\\' app, as evidenced by the welcome screen in the second screenshot. This was not the intended \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' app. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal and was a failure.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button to close the \\'Google Calendar\\' app and return to the previous screen, which should be the app drawer. The current screen is the welcome screen of Google Calendar. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button successfully closed the \\'Google Calendar\\' app and returned the view to the app drawer. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as it allows for another attempt to open the correct \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' app.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 3: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[511,165],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Calendar\\' app icon located at approximately `[511, 165]` (center of bounding box `[503, 94, 519, 237]`) to open the Simple Calendar Pro application.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is taken to find and open the \\'Calendar\\' app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, which is to open the \\'Calendar\\' app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[380,836],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Calendar\\' app icon (the one with \\'15\\' on it, located at approximately [380, 836]) to open the Simple Calendar Pro application. The icon is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Calendar\\' icon at approximately [380, 836] resulted in opening the \\'Google Calendar\\' app, as evidenced by the welcome screen in the second screenshot. This was not the intended \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' app. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal and was a failure.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button to close the \\'Google Calendar\\' app and return to the previous screen, which should be the app drawer. The current screen is the welcome screen of Google Calendar. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button successfully closed the \\'Google Calendar\\' app and returned the view to the app drawer. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as it allows for another attempt to open the correct \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' app.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[511,165],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Calendar\\' app icon located at approximately `[511, 165]` (center of bounding box `[503, 94, 519, 237]`) to open the Simple Calendar Pro application. This icon is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Calendar\\' app icon at [511, 165] was successful. It opened the \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' application, which is now displaying the calendar for October, with October 15th highlighted as the current date. This action directly led to the completion of the active subgoal (Open \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' app) and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The event should last for 30 mins.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 4 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the middle of the screen (start_point: [900, 500]) towards the top (end_point: [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is taken to find and open the \\'Calendar\\' app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, which is to open the \\'Calendar\\' app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[380,836],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Calendar\\' app icon (the one with \\'15\\' on it, located at approximately [380, 836]) to open the Simple Calendar Pro application. The icon is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Calendar\\' icon at approximately [380, 836] resulted in opening the \\'Google Calendar\\' app, as evidenced by the welcome screen in the second screenshot. This was not the intended \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' app. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal and was a failure.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button to close the \\'Google Calendar\\' app and return to the previous screen, which should be the app drawer. The current screen is the welcome screen of Google Calendar. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button successfully closed the \\'Google Calendar\\' app and returned the view to the app drawer. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as it allows for another attempt to open the correct \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' app.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[511,165],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Calendar\\' app icon located at approximately `[511, 165]` (center of bounding box `[503, 94, 519, 237]`) to open the Simple Calendar Pro application. This icon is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Calendar\\' app icon at [511, 165] was successful. It opened the \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' application, which is now displaying the calendar for October, with October 15th highlighted as the current date. This action directly led to the completion of the active subgoal (Open \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' app) and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 4: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

This action is taken to find and open the \\'Calendar\\' app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, which is to open the \\'Calendar\\' app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[380,836],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Calendar\\' app icon (the one with \\'15\\' on it, located at approximately [380, 836]) to open the Simple Calendar Pro application. The icon is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Calendar\\' icon at approximately [380, 836] resulted in opening the \\'Google Calendar\\' app, as evidenced by the welcome screen in the second screenshot. This was not the intended \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' app. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal and was a failure.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button to close the \\'Google Calendar\\' app and return to the previous screen, which should be the app drawer. The current screen is the welcome screen of Google Calendar. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button successfully closed the \\'Google Calendar\\' app and returned the view to the app drawer. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as it allows for another attempt to open the correct \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' app.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[511,165],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Calendar\\' app icon located at approximately `[511, 165]` (center of bounding box `[503, 94, 519, 237]`) to open the Simple Calendar Pro application. This icon is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Calendar\\' app icon at [511, 165] was successful. It opened the \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' application, which is now displaying the calendar for October, with October 15th highlighted as the current date. This action directly led to the completion of the active subgoal (Open \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' app) and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[604,214],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the date \\'16\\' (center at [604, 214]) to select October 16th. The date \\'16\\' is currently not selected. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the date \\'16\\' at [604, 214] was successful. The calendar view changed from displaying the entire month of October with the 15th selected, to displaying the view for \\'October 16 (Mon)\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully navigating to the correct date for the new event. The active subgoal is now completed.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.37\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [79, 171, 99, 314], \\'text\\': \\'Search\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [150, 287, 180, 718], \\'text\\': \\'October 16 (Mon)\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [895, 819, 957, 968]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 745, 114, 846]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 856, 112, 940]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [142, 884, 186, 984]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 627, 115, 729]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [141, 19, 188, 120]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right.

The event should last for 30 mins.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the middle of the screen (start_point: [900, 500]) towards the top (end_point: [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is taken to find and open the \\'Calendar\\' app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, which is to open the \\'Calendar\\' app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[380,836],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Calendar\\' app icon (the one with \\'15\\' on it, located at approximately [380, 836]) to open the Simple Calendar Pro application. The icon is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Calendar\\' icon at approximately [380, 836] resulted in opening the \\'Google Calendar\\' app, as evidenced by the welcome screen in the second screenshot. This was not the intended \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' app. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal and was a failure.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button to close the \\'Google Calendar\\' app and return to the previous screen, which should be the app drawer. The current screen is the welcome screen of Google Calendar. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button successfully closed the \\'Google Calendar\\' app and returned the view to the app drawer. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as it allows for another attempt to open the correct \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' app.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[511,165],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Calendar\\' app icon located at approximately `[511, 165]` (center of bounding box `[503, 94, 519, 237]`) to open the Simple Calendar Pro application. This icon is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Calendar\\' app icon at [511, 165] was successful. It opened the \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' application, which is now displaying the calendar for October, with October 15th highlighted as the current date. This action directly led to the completion of the active subgoal (Open \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' app) and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[604,214],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the date \\'16\\' (center at [604, 214]) to select October 16th. The date \\'16\\' is currently not selected. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the date \\'16\\' at [604, 214] was successful. The calendar view changed from displaying the entire month of October with the 15th selected, to displaying the view for \\'October 16 (Mon)\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully navigating to the correct date for the new event. The active subgoal is now completed.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 5: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[926,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the plus icon located at the center of `[895, 819, 957, 968]` (approximately `[926, 893]`) to initiate the creation of a new event. The plus icon is currently visible and tappable. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' app (likely named \\'Calendar\\')\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'Calendar\\' app is open and its main interface is visible. `SimpleCalendarProAppNameOnDevice` and `LocationOfCalendarAppIconInAppDrawer` are recorded in AgentMemory.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully opened the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[380,836],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Calendar\\' app icon (the one with \\'15\\' on it, located at approximately [380, 836]) to open the Simple Calendar Pro application. The icon is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Calendar\\' icon at approximately [380, 836] resulted in opening the \\'Google Calendar\\' app, as evidenced by the welcome screen in the second screenshot. This was not the intended \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' app. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal and was a failure.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button to close the \\'Google Calendar\\' app and return to the previous screen, which should be the app drawer. The current screen is the welcome screen of Google Calendar. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button successfully closed the \\'Google Calendar\\' app and returned the view to the app drawer. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as it allows for another attempt to open the correct \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' app.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[511,165],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Calendar\\' app icon located at approximately `[511, 165]` (center of bounding box `[503, 94, 519, 237]`) to open the Simple Calendar Pro application. This icon is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Calendar\\' app icon at [511, 165] was successful. It opened the \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' application, which is now displaying the calendar for October, with October 15th highlighted as the current date. This action directly led to the completion of the active subgoal (Open \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' app) and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[604,214],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the date \\'16\\' (center at [604, 214]) to select October 16th. The date \\'16\\' is currently not selected. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the date \\'16\\' at [604, 214] was successful. The calendar view changed from displaying the entire month of October with the 15th selected, to displaying the view for \\'October 16 (Mon)\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully navigating to the correct date for the new event. The active subgoal is now completed.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[926,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the plus icon located at the center of `[895, 819, 957, 968]` (approximately `[926, 893]`) to initiate the creation of a new event. The plus icon is currently visible and tappable. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the plus icon at `[926, 893]` was successful. It caused a menu to appear with two options: \\'Task\\' (text at `[846, 690, 867, 792]`, icon at `[834, 841, 882, 946]`) and \\'Event\\' (text at `[917, 676, 936, 792]`, icon at `[905, 820, 948, 945]`). This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to select \\'Event\\' from this menu to open the event creation screen.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.37\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [79, 171, 99, 314], \\'text\\': \\'Search\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [150, 288, 180, 716], \\'text\\': \\'October 16 (Mon)\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [846, 690, 867, 792], \\'text\\': \\'Task\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [917, 676, 936, 792], \\'text\\': \\'Event\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [894, 818, 957, 970]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [834, 841, 882, 946]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 743, 111, 845]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 859, 111, 939]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [139, 879, 187, 987]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 626, 115, 730]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [9, 819, 44, 950]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [140, 16, 188, 124]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [833, 659, 881, 818]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 193, 40, 244]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The event should last for 30 mins.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[380,836],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Calendar\\' app icon (the one with \\'15\\' on it, located at approximately [380, 836]) to open the Simple Calendar Pro application. The icon is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Calendar\\' icon at approximately [380, 836] resulted in opening the \\'Google Calendar\\' app, as evidenced by the welcome screen in the second screenshot. This was not the intended \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' app. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal and was a failure.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button to close the \\'Google Calendar\\' app and return to the previous screen, which should be the app drawer. The current screen is the welcome screen of Google Calendar. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button successfully closed the \\'Google Calendar\\' app and returned the view to the app drawer. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as it allows for another attempt to open the correct \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' app.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[511,165],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Calendar\\' app icon located at approximately `[511, 165]` (center of bounding box `[503, 94, 519, 237]`) to open the Simple Calendar Pro application. This icon is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Calendar\\' app icon at [511, 165] was successful. It opened the \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' application, which is now displaying the calendar for October, with October 15th highlighted as the current date. This action directly led to the completion of the active subgoal (Open \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' app) and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[604,214],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the date \\'16\\' (center at [604, 214]) to select October 16th. The date \\'16\\' is currently not selected. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the date \\'16\\' at [604, 214] was successful. The calendar view changed from displaying the entire month of October with the 15th selected, to displaying the view for \\'October 16 (Mon)\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully navigating to the correct date for the new event. The active subgoal is now completed.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[926,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the plus icon located at the center of `[895, 819, 957, 968]` (approximately `[926, 893]`) to initiate the creation of a new event. The plus icon is currently visible and tappable. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the plus icon at `[926, 893]` was successful. It caused a menu to appear with two options: \\'Task\\' (text at `[846, 690, 867, 792]`, icon at `[834, 841, 882, 946]`) and \\'Event\\' (text at `[917, 676, 936, 792]`, icon at `[905, 820, 948, 945]`). This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to select \\'Event\\' from this menu to open the event creation screen.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 6: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[925,894],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Event\\' icon (center at approximately `[925, 894]`, bounding box `[894, 818, 957, 970]`) to open the new event creation screen. The \\'Event\\' option is currently visible and selectable. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' app (likely named \\'Calendar\\')\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'Calendar\\' app is open and its main interface is visible. `SimpleCalendarProAppNameOnDevice` and `LocationOfCalendarAppIconInAppDrawer` are recorded in AgentMemory.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully opened the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The current screen is the welcome screen of Google Calendar. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button successfully closed the \\'Google Calendar\\' app and returned the view to the app drawer. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as it allows for another attempt to open the correct \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' app.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[511,165],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Calendar\\' app icon located at approximately `[511, 165]` (center of bounding box `[503, 94, 519, 237]`) to open the Simple Calendar Pro application. This icon is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Calendar\\' app icon at [511, 165] was successful. It opened the \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' application, which is now displaying the calendar for October, with October 15th highlighted as the current date. This action directly led to the completion of the active subgoal (Open \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' app) and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[604,214],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the date \\'16\\' (center at [604, 214]) to select October 16th. The date \\'16\\' is currently not selected. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the date \\'16\\' at [604, 214] was successful. The calendar view changed from displaying the entire month of October with the 15th selected, to displaying the view for \\'October 16 (Mon)\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully navigating to the correct date for the new event. The active subgoal is now completed.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[926,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the plus icon located at the center of `[895, 819, 957, 968]` (approximately `[926, 893]`) to initiate the creation of a new event. The plus icon is currently visible and tappable. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the plus icon at `[926, 893]` was successful. It caused a menu to appear with two options: \\'Task\\' (text at `[846, 690, 867, 792]`, icon at `[834, 841, 882, 946]`) and \\'Event\\' (text at `[917, 676, 936, 792]`, icon at `[905, 820, 948, 945]`). This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to select \\'Event\\' from this menu to open the event creation screen.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[925,894],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Event\\' icon (center at approximately `[925, 894]`, bounding box `[894, 818, 957, 970]`) to open the new event creation screen. The \\'Event\\' option is currently visible and selectable. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Event\\' icon was successful. It opened the \\'New Event\\' screen, which is the interface for creating a new calendar event. This completes Subgoal 3. The agent is now closer to fulfilling the user instruction, as the necessary screen for inputting event details is active. The \\'Title\\' text field is currently focused, ready for text input.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.38\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [79, 145, 101, 390], \\'text\\': \\'New Event\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [155, 43, 175, 135], \\'text\\': \\'Title\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [221, 45, 240, 213], \\'text\\': \\'Location\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [287, 45, 310, 266], \\'text\\': \\'Description\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [375, 142, 402, 282], \\'text\\': \\'All-day\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [443, 143, 467, 480], \\'text\\': \\'October 16 (Mon)\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [444, 836, 463, 946], \\'text\\': \\'16.00\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [503, 144, 527, 480], \\'text\\': \\'October 16 (Mon)\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [505, 836, 524, 946], \\'text\\': \\'16.00\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [583, 145, 602, 488], \\'text\\': \\'10 minutes before\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [643, 147, 662, 555], \\'text\\': \\'Add another reminder\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [713, 53, 742, 394], \\'text\\': \\'\u00d6 No repetition\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [788, 143, 814, 406], \\'text\\': \\'Regular event\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [860, 145, 879, 361], \\'text\\': \\'Event color\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [849, 872, 896, 966]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [693, 5, 765, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [215, 879, 253, 936]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 196, 38, 243]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [948, 633, 1000, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [372, 48, 403, 282]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"0\", text=\"Title\", resource-id=\"com.simplemobiletools.calendar.pro:id/event_title\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"com.simplemobiletools.calendar.pro\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[42,338][1038,454]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"Title\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The event should last for 30 mins.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the system back button to close the \\'Google Calendar\\' app and return to the previous screen, which should be the app drawer. The current screen is the welcome screen of Google Calendar. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button successfully closed the \\'Google Calendar\\' app and returned the view to the app drawer. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as it allows for another attempt to open the correct \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' app.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[511,165],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Calendar\\' app icon located at approximately `[511, 165]` (center of bounding box `[503, 94, 519, 237]`) to open the Simple Calendar Pro application. This icon is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Calendar\\' app icon at [511, 165] was successful. It opened the \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' application, which is now displaying the calendar for October, with October 15th highlighted as the current date. This action directly led to the completion of the active subgoal (Open \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' app) and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[604,214],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the date \\'16\\' (center at [604, 214]) to select October 16th. The date \\'16\\' is currently not selected. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the date \\'16\\' at [604, 214] was successful. The calendar view changed from displaying the entire month of October with the 15th selected, to displaying the view for \\'October 16 (Mon)\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully navigating to the correct date for the new event. The active subgoal is now completed.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[926,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the plus icon located at the center of `[895, 819, 957, 968]` (approximately `[926, 893]`) to initiate the creation of a new event. The plus icon is currently visible and tappable. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the plus icon at `[926, 893]` was successful. It caused a menu to appear with two options: \\'Task\\' (text at `[846, 690, 867, 792]`, icon at `[834, 841, 882, 946]`) and \\'Event\\' (text at `[917, 676, 936, 792]`, icon at `[905, 820, 948, 945]`). This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to select \\'Event\\' from this menu to open the event creation screen.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[925,894],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Event\\' icon (center at approximately `[925, 894]`, bounding box `[894, 818, 957, 970]`) to open the new event creation screen. The \\'Event\\' option is currently visible and selectable. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Event\\' icon was successful. It opened the \\'New Event\\' screen, which is the interface for creating a new calendar event. This completes Subgoal 3. The agent is now closer to fulfilling the user instruction, as the necessary screen for inputting event details is active. The \\'Title\\' text field is currently focused, ready for text input.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 7: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Call with the Team\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Call with the Team\\' into the currently focused \\'Title\\' text field. The \\'Title\\' field is currently focused and has placeholder text \\'Title\\'. After this action, the \\'Title\\' field should contain \\'Call with the Team\\'.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[511,165],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Calendar\\' app icon located at approximately `[511, 165]` (center of bounding box `[503, 94, 519, 237]`) to open the Simple Calendar Pro application. This icon is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Calendar\\' app icon at [511, 165] was successful. It opened the \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' application, which is now displaying the calendar for October, with October 15th highlighted as the current date. This action directly led to the completion of the active subgoal (Open \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' app) and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[604,214],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the date \\'16\\' (center at [604, 214]) to select October 16th. The date \\'16\\' is currently not selected. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the date \\'16\\' at [604, 214] was successful. The calendar view changed from displaying the entire month of October with the 15th selected, to displaying the view for \\'October 16 (Mon)\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully navigating to the correct date for the new event. The active subgoal is now completed.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[926,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the plus icon located at the center of `[895, 819, 957, 968]` (approximately `[926, 893]`) to initiate the creation of a new event. The plus icon is currently visible and tappable. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the plus icon at `[926, 893]` was successful. It caused a menu to appear with two options: \\'Task\\' (text at `[846, 690, 867, 792]`, icon at `[834, 841, 882, 946]`) and \\'Event\\' (text at `[917, 676, 936, 792]`, icon at `[905, 820, 948, 945]`). This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to select \\'Event\\' from this menu to open the event creation screen.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[925,894],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Event\\' icon (center at approximately `[925, 894]`, bounding box `[894, 818, 957, 970]`) to open the new event creation screen. The \\'Event\\' option is currently visible and selectable. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Event\\' icon was successful. It opened the \\'New Event\\' screen, which is the interface for creating a new calendar event. This completes Subgoal 3. The agent is now closer to fulfilling the user instruction, as the necessary screen for inputting event details is active. The \\'Title\\' text field is currently focused, ready for text input.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Call with the Team\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Call with the Team\\' into the currently focused \\'Title\\' text field. The \\'Title\\' field is currently focused and has placeholder text \\'Title\\'. After this action, the \\'Title\\' field should contain \\'Call with the Team\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting text \\'Call with the Team\\' into the \\'Title\\' field was successful. The \\'Title\\' field now correctly displays \\'Call with the Team\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by fulfilling one of the required event details.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"Call with the Team\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[511,165],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Calendar\\' app icon located at approximately `[511, 165]` (center of bounding box `[503, 94, 519, 237]`) to open the Simple Calendar Pro application. This icon is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Calendar\\' app icon at [511, 165] was successful. It opened the \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' application, which is now displaying the calendar for October, with October 15th highlighted as the current date. This action directly led to the completion of the active subgoal (Open \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' app) and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[604,214],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the date \\'16\\' (center at [604, 214]) to select October 16th. The date \\'16\\' is currently not selected. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the date \\'16\\' at [604, 214] was successful. The calendar view changed from displaying the entire month of October with the 15th selected, to displaying the view for \\'October 16 (Mon)\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully navigating to the correct date for the new event. The active subgoal is now completed.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[926,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the plus icon located at the center of `[895, 819, 957, 968]` (approximately `[926, 893]`) to initiate the creation of a new event. The plus icon is currently visible and tappable. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the plus icon at `[926, 893]` was successful. It caused a menu to appear with two options: \\'Task\\' (text at `[846, 690, 867, 792]`, icon at `[834, 841, 882, 946]`) and \\'Event\\' (text at `[917, 676, 936, 792]`, icon at `[905, 820, 948, 945]`).

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The date \\'16\\' is currently not selected. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the date \\'16\\' at [604, 214] was successful. The calendar view changed from displaying the entire month of October with the 15th selected, to displaying the view for \\'October 16 (Mon)\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully navigating to the correct date for the new event. The active subgoal is now completed.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[926,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the plus icon located at the center of `[895, 819, 957, 968]` (approximately `[926, 893]`) to initiate the creation of a new event. The plus icon is currently visible and tappable. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the plus icon at `[926, 893]` was successful. It caused a menu to appear with two options: \\'Task\\' (text at `[846, 690, 867, 792]`, icon at `[834, 841, 882, 946]`) and \\'Event\\' (text at `[917, 676, 936, 792]`, icon at `[905, 820, 948, 945]`). This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to select \\'Event\\' from this menu to open the event creation screen.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[925,894],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Event\\' icon (center at approximately `[925, 894]`, bounding box `[894, 818, 957, 970]`) to open the new event creation screen. The \\'Event\\' option is currently visible and selectable. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Event\\' icon was successful. It opened the \\'New Event\\' screen, which is the interface for creating a new calendar event. This completes Subgoal 3. The agent is now closer to fulfilling the user instruction, as the necessary screen for inputting event details is active. The \\'Title\\' text field is currently focused, ready for text input.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Call with the Team\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Call with the Team\\' into the currently focused \\'Title\\' text field. The \\'Title\\' field is currently focused and has placeholder text \\'Title\\'. After this action, the \\'Title\\' field should contain \\'Call with the Team\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting text \\'Call with the Team\\' into the \\'Title\\' field was successful. The \\'Title\\' field now correctly displays \\'Call with the Team\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by fulfilling one of the required event details.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

The current start time is \\'16:00\\'. After tapping, a time picker should appear, allowing me to set the start time to 20:00. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the start time \\'16:00\\' (at `[454, 891]`) was successful. A \\'Select time\\' dialog (time picker) appeared, overlaying the \\'New Event\\' screen. The time picker currently shows \\'16:00\\' selected. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing the interface to change the event\\'s start time.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The event should last for 30 mins.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[604,214],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the date \\'16\\' (center at [604, 214]) to select October 16th. The date \\'16\\' is currently not selected. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the date \\'16\\' at [604, 214] was successful. The calendar view changed from displaying the entire month of October with the 15th selected, to displaying the view for \\'October 16 (Mon)\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully navigating to the correct date for the new event. The active subgoal is now completed.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[926,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the plus icon located at the center of `[895, 819, 957, 968]` (approximately `[926, 893]`) to initiate the creation of a new event. The plus icon is currently visible and tappable. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the plus icon at `[926, 893]` was successful. It caused a menu to appear with two options: \\'Task\\' (text at `[846, 690, 867, 792]`, icon at `[834, 841, 882, 946]`) and \\'Event\\' (text at `[917, 676, 936, 792]`, icon at `[905, 820, 948, 945]`). This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to select \\'Event\\' from this menu to open the event creation screen.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[925,894],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Event\\' icon (center at approximately `[925, 894]`, bounding box `[894, 818, 957, 970]`) to open the new event creation screen. The \\'Event\\' option is currently visible and selectable. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Event\\' icon was successful. It opened the \\'New Event\\' screen, which is the interface for creating a new calendar event. This completes Subgoal 3. The agent is now closer to fulfilling the user instruction, as the necessary screen for inputting event details is active. The \\'Title\\' text field is currently focused, ready for text input.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Call with the Team\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Call with the Team\\' into the currently focused \\'Title\\' text field. The \\'Title\\' field is currently focused and has placeholder text \\'Title\\'. After this action, the \\'Title\\' field should contain \\'Call with the Team\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting text \\'Call with the Team\\' into the \\'Title\\' field was successful. The \\'Title\\' field now correctly displays \\'Call with the Team\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by fulfilling one of the required event details.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[454,891],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the start time \\'16:00\\' (located at approximately `[454, 891]`, within bounding box `[444, 836, 463, 946]`) to open the time picker dialog. The current start time is \\'16:00\\'. After tapping, a time picker should appear, allowing me to set the start time to 20:00. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the start time \\'16:00\\' (at `[454, 891]`) was successful. A \\'Select time\\' dialog (time picker) appeared, overlaying the \\'New Event\\' screen. The time picker currently shows \\'16:00\\' selected. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing the interface to change the event\\'s start time.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 9: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[601,362],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the number \\'20\\' on the clock face (center at approximately `[601, 362]`) to select 20 as the hour for the event start time. The number \\'20\\' is currently not selected. After this action, the hour display at the top should change from \\'16\\' to \\'20\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' app (likely named \\'Calendar\\')\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'Calendar\\' app is open and its main interface is visible. `SimpleCalendarProAppNameOnDevice` and `LocationOfCalendarAppIconInAppDrawer` are recorded in AgentMemory.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully opened the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[926,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the plus icon located at the center of `[895, 819, 957, 968]` (approximately `[926, 893]`) to initiate the creation of a new event. The plus icon is currently visible and tappable. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the plus icon at `[926, 893]` was successful. It caused a menu to appear with two options: \\'Task\\' (text at `[846, 690, 867, 792]`, icon at `[834, 841, 882, 946]`) and \\'Event\\' (text at `[917, 676, 936, 792]`, icon at `[905, 820, 948, 945]`). This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to select \\'Event\\' from this menu to open the event creation screen.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[925,894],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Event\\' icon (center at approximately `[925, 894]`, bounding box `[894, 818, 957, 970]`) to open the new event creation screen. The \\'Event\\' option is currently visible and selectable. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Event\\' icon was successful. It opened the \\'New Event\\' screen, which is the interface for creating a new calendar event. This completes Subgoal 3. The agent is now closer to fulfilling the user instruction, as the necessary screen for inputting event details is active. The \\'Title\\' text field is currently focused, ready for text input.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Call with the Team\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Call with the Team\\' into the currently focused \\'Title\\' text field. The \\'Title\\' field is currently focused and has placeholder text \\'Title\\'. After this action, the \\'Title\\' field should contain \\'Call with the Team\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting text \\'Call with the Team\\' into the \\'Title\\' field was successful. The \\'Title\\' field now correctly displays \\'Call with the Team\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by fulfilling one of the required event details.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[454,891],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the start time \\'16:00\\' (located at approximately `[454, 891]`, within bounding box `[444, 836, 463, 946]`) to open the time picker dialog. The current start time is \\'16:00\\'. After tapping, a time picker should appear, allowing me to set the start time to 20:00. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the start time \\'16:00\\' (at `[454, 891]`) was successful. A \\'Select time\\' dialog (time picker) appeared, overlaying the \\'New Event\\' screen. The time picker currently shows \\'16:00\\' selected. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing the interface to change the event\\'s start time.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[601,362],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the number \\'20\\' on the clock face (center at approximately `[601, 362]`) to select 20 as the hour for the event start time. The number \\'20\\' is currently not selected. After this action, the hour display at the top should change from \\'16\\' to \\'20\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'20\\' on the clock face (at `[601, 362]`) was successful. The hour displayed in the \\'Select time\\' dialog changed from \\'16\\' to \\'20\\'. The dialog then automatically switched to minute selection mode, with \\'00\\' minutes pre-selected. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by correctly setting the start hour for the event.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The event should last for 30 mins.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[926,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the plus icon located at the center of `[895, 819, 957, 968]` (approximately `[926, 893]`) to initiate the creation of a new event. The plus icon is currently visible and tappable. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the plus icon at `[926, 893]` was successful. It caused a menu to appear with two options: \\'Task\\' (text at `[846, 690, 867, 792]`, icon at `[834, 841, 882, 946]`) and \\'Event\\' (text at `[917, 676, 936, 792]`, icon at `[905, 820, 948, 945]`). This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to select \\'Event\\' from this menu to open the event creation screen.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[925,894],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Event\\' icon (center at approximately `[925, 894]`, bounding box `[894, 818, 957, 970]`) to open the new event creation screen. The \\'Event\\' option is currently visible and selectable. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Event\\' icon was successful. It opened the \\'New Event\\' screen, which is the interface for creating a new calendar event. This completes Subgoal 3. The agent is now closer to fulfilling the user instruction, as the necessary screen for inputting event details is active. The \\'Title\\' text field is currently focused, ready for text input.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Call with the Team\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Call with the Team\\' into the currently focused \\'Title\\' text field. The \\'Title\\' field is currently focused and has placeholder text \\'Title\\'. After this action, the \\'Title\\' field should contain \\'Call with the Team\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting text \\'Call with the Team\\' into the \\'Title\\' field was successful. The \\'Title\\' field now correctly displays \\'Call with the Team\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by fulfilling one of the required event details.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[454,891],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the start time \\'16:00\\' (located at approximately `[454, 891]`, within bounding box `[444, 836, 463, 946]`) to open the time picker dialog. The current start time is \\'16:00\\'. After tapping, a time picker should appear, allowing me to set the start time to 20:00. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the start time \\'16:00\\' (at `[454, 891]`) was successful. A \\'Select time\\' dialog (time picker) appeared, overlaying the \\'New Event\\' screen. The time picker currently shows \\'16:00\\' selected. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing the interface to change the event\\'s start time.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[601,362],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the number \\'20\\' on the clock face (center at approximately `[601, 362]`) to select 20 as the hour for the event start time. The number \\'20\\' is currently not selected. After this action, the hour display at the top should change from \\'16\\' to \\'20\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'20\\' on the clock face (at `[601, 362]`) was successful. The hour displayed in the \\'Select time\\' dialog changed from \\'16\\' to \\'20\\'. The dialog then automatically switched to minute selection mode, with \\'00\\' minutes pre-selected. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by correctly setting the start hour for the event.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 10: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[760,774],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button (center at approximately `[760, 774]`, bounding box `[753, 750, 767, 799]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog to confirm the start time of 20:00. The \\'OK\\' button is currently visible and tappable. After this action, the \\'Select time\\' dialog should close, and the \\'New Event\\' screen should show the updated start time. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' app (likely named \\'Calendar\\')\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'Calendar\\' app is open and its main interface is visible. `SimpleCalendarProAppNameOnDevice` and `LocationOfCalendarAppIconInAppDrawer` are recorded in AgentMemory.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully opened the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[925,894],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Event\\' icon (center at approximately `[925, 894]`, bounding box `[894, 818, 957, 970]`) to open the new event creation screen. The \\'Event\\' option is currently visible and selectable. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Event\\' icon was successful. It opened the \\'New Event\\' screen, which is the interface for creating a new calendar event. This completes Subgoal 3. The agent is now closer to fulfilling the user instruction, as the necessary screen for inputting event details is active. The \\'Title\\' text field is currently focused, ready for text input.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Call with the Team\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Call with the Team\\' into the currently focused \\'Title\\' text field. The \\'Title\\' field is currently focused and has placeholder text \\'Title\\'. After this action, the \\'Title\\' field should contain \\'Call with the Team\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting text \\'Call with the Team\\' into the \\'Title\\' field was successful. The \\'Title\\' field now correctly displays \\'Call with the Team\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by fulfilling one of the required event details.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[454,891],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the start time \\'16:00\\' (located at approximately `[454, 891]`, within bounding box `[444, 836, 463, 946]`) to open the time picker dialog. The current start time is \\'16:00\\'. After tapping, a time picker should appear, allowing me to set the start time to 20:00. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the start time \\'16:00\\' (at `[454, 891]`) was successful. A \\'Select time\\' dialog (time picker) appeared, overlaying the \\'New Event\\' screen. The time picker currently shows \\'16:00\\' selected. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing the interface to change the event\\'s start time.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[601,362],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the number \\'20\\' on the clock face (center at approximately `[601, 362]`) to select 20 as the hour for the event start time. The number \\'20\\' is currently not selected. After this action, the hour display at the top should change from \\'16\\' to \\'20\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'20\\' on the clock face (at `[601, 362]`) was successful. The hour displayed in the \\'Select time\\' dialog changed from \\'16\\' to \\'20\\'. The dialog then automatically switched to minute selection mode, with \\'00\\' minutes pre-selected. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by correctly setting the start hour for the event.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[760,774],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button (center at approximately `[760, 774]`, bounding box `[753, 750, 767, 799]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog to confirm the start time of 20:00. The \\'OK\\' button is currently visible and tappable. After this action, the \\'Select time\\' dialog should close, and the \\'New Event\\' screen should show the updated start time. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'OK\\' button in the \\'Select time\\' dialog was successful. The dialog closed, and the start time on the \\'New Event\\' screen was updated to \\'20:00\\'. The end time also shows \\'20:00\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully setting the event\\'s start time.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 132], \\'text\\': \\'15.41\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [79, 145, 101, 390], \\'text\\': \\'New Event\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [155, 45, 175, 392], \\'text\\': \\'Call with the Team\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [221, 45, 240, 213], \\'text\\': \\'Location\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [287, 45, 310, 266], \\'text\\': \\'Description\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [375, 142, 402, 282], \\'text\\': \\'All-day\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [443, 143, 467, 480], \\'text\\': \\'October 16 (Mon)\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [444, 836, 463, 946], \\'text\\': \\'20.00\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [503, 144, 527, 480], \\'text\\': \\'October 16 (Mon)\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [505, 836, 524, 946], \\'text\\': \\'20:.00\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [583, 145, 602, 488], \\'text\\': \\'10 minutes before\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [643, 147, 662, 555], \\'text\\': \\'Add another reminder\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [713, 53, 742, 394], \\'text\\': \\'\u00d6 No repetition\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [788, 143, 814, 406], \\'text\\': \\'Regular event\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [860, 145, 879, 361], \\'text\\': \\'Event color\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [849, 871, 894, 966]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [363, 864, 422, 977]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [372, 48, 403, 282]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [215, 878, 253, 936]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The event should last for 30 mins.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[925,894],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Event\\' icon (center at approximately `[925, 894]`, bounding box `[894, 818, 957, 970]`) to open the new event creation screen. The \\'Event\\' option is currently visible and selectable. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Event\\' icon was successful. It opened the \\'New Event\\' screen, which is the interface for creating a new calendar event. This completes Subgoal 3. The agent is now closer to fulfilling the user instruction, as the necessary screen for inputting event details is active. The \\'Title\\' text field is currently focused, ready for text input.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Call with the Team\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Call with the Team\\' into the currently focused \\'Title\\' text field. The \\'Title\\' field is currently focused and has placeholder text \\'Title\\'. After this action, the \\'Title\\' field should contain \\'Call with the Team\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting text \\'Call with the Team\\' into the \\'Title\\' field was successful. The \\'Title\\' field now correctly displays \\'Call with the Team\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by fulfilling one of the required event details.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[454,891],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the start time \\'16:00\\' (located at approximately `[454, 891]`, within bounding box `[444, 836, 463, 946]`) to open the time picker dialog. The current start time is \\'16:00\\'. After tapping, a time picker should appear, allowing me to set the start time to 20:00. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the start time \\'16:00\\' (at `[454, 891]`) was successful. A \\'Select time\\' dialog (time picker) appeared, overlaying the \\'New Event\\' screen. The time picker currently shows \\'16:00\\' selected. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing the interface to change the event\\'s start time.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[601,362],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the number \\'20\\' on the clock face (center at approximately `[601, 362]`) to select 20 as the hour for the event start time. The number \\'20\\' is currently not selected. After this action, the hour display at the top should change from \\'16\\' to \\'20\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'20\\' on the clock face (at `[601, 362]`) was successful. The hour displayed in the \\'Select time\\' dialog changed from \\'16\\' to \\'20\\'. The dialog then automatically switched to minute selection mode, with \\'00\\' minutes pre-selected. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by correctly setting the start hour for the event.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[760,774],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button (center at approximately `[760, 774]`, bounding box `[753, 750, 767, 799]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog to confirm the start time of 20:00. The \\'OK\\' button is currently visible and tappable. After this action, the \\'Select time\\' dialog should close, and the \\'New Event\\' screen should show the updated start time. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'OK\\' button in the \\'Select time\\' dialog was successful. The dialog closed, and the start time on the \\'New Event\\' screen was updated to \\'20:00\\'. The end time also shows \\'20:00\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully setting the event\\'s start time.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 11: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[514,891],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the end time \\'20:00\\' (located at approximately `[514, 891]`, within bounding box `[505, 836, 524, 946]`) to open the time picker dialog. The current end time is \\'20:00\\'. After tapping, a time picker should appear, allowing me to set the end time to 20:30.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The event should last for 30 mins.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Call with the Team\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Call with the Team\\' into the currently focused \\'Title\\' text field. The \\'Title\\' field is currently focused and has placeholder text \\'Title\\'. After this action, the \\'Title\\' field should contain \\'Call with the Team\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting text \\'Call with the Team\\' into the \\'Title\\' field was successful. The \\'Title\\' field now correctly displays \\'Call with the Team\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by fulfilling one of the required event details.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[454,891],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the start time \\'16:00\\' (located at approximately `[454, 891]`, within bounding box `[444, 836, 463, 946]`) to open the time picker dialog. The current start time is \\'16:00\\'. After tapping, a time picker should appear, allowing me to set the start time to 20:00. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the start time \\'16:00\\' (at `[454, 891]`) was successful. A \\'Select time\\' dialog (time picker) appeared, overlaying the \\'New Event\\' screen. The time picker currently shows \\'16:00\\' selected. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing the interface to change the event\\'s start time.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[601,362],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the number \\'20\\' on the clock face (center at approximately `[601, 362]`) to select 20 as the hour for the event start time. The number \\'20\\' is currently not selected. After this action, the hour display at the top should change from \\'16\\' to \\'20\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'20\\' on the clock face (at `[601, 362]`) was successful. The hour displayed in the \\'Select time\\' dialog changed from \\'16\\' to \\'20\\'. The dialog then automatically switched to minute selection mode, with \\'00\\' minutes pre-selected. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by correctly setting the start hour for the event.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[760,774],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button (center at approximately `[760, 774]`, bounding box `[753, 750, 767, 799]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog to confirm the start time of 20:00. The \\'OK\\' button is currently visible and tappable. After this action, the \\'Select time\\' dialog should close, and the \\'New Event\\' screen should show the updated start time. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'OK\\' button in the \\'Select time\\' dialog was successful. The dialog closed, and the start time on the \\'New Event\\' screen was updated to \\'20:00\\'. The end time also shows \\'20:00\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully setting the event\\'s start time.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[514,891],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the end time \\'20:00\\' (located at approximately `[514, 891]`, within bounding box `[505, 836, 524, 946]`) to open the time picker dialog. The current end time is \\'20:00\\'. After tapping, a time picker should appear, allowing me to set the end time to 20:30. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the end time \\'20:00\\' (at `[514, 891]`) was successful. A \\'Select time\\' dialog appeared, overlaying the \\'New Event\\' screen. The dialog is currently set to select the end time and shows \\'20:00\\', with the hour \\'20\\' actively selected (highlighted on the clock face and in the digital display). This indicates the dialog is in hour selection mode. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing the interface to change the event\\'s end time.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 12: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[340,647],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'00\\' minutes display (center at approximately `[340, 647]`, within bounding box `[312, 564, 368, 730]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog to switch to minute selection mode. The dialog is currently in hour selection mode for the end time. After this action, the dialog should switch to minute selection mode, allowing me to select \\'30\\' for the minutes.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[454,891],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the start time \\'16:00\\' (located at approximately `[454, 891]`, within bounding box `[444, 836, 463, 946]`) to open the time picker dialog. The current start time is \\'16:00\\'. After tapping, a time picker should appear, allowing me to set the start time to 20:00. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the start time \\'16:00\\' (at `[454, 891]`) was successful. A \\'Select time\\' dialog (time picker) appeared, overlaying the \\'New Event\\' screen. The time picker currently shows \\'16:00\\' selected. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing the interface to change the event\\'s start time.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[601,362],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the number \\'20\\' on the clock face (center at approximately `[601, 362]`) to select 20 as the hour for the event start time. The number \\'20\\' is currently not selected. After this action, the hour display at the top should change from \\'16\\' to \\'20\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'20\\' on the clock face (at `[601, 362]`) was successful. The hour displayed in the \\'Select time\\' dialog changed from \\'16\\' to \\'20\\'. The dialog then automatically switched to minute selection mode, with \\'00\\' minutes pre-selected. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by correctly setting the start hour for the event.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[760,774],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button (center at approximately `[760, 774]`, bounding box `[753, 750, 767, 799]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog to confirm the start time of 20:00. The \\'OK\\' button is currently visible and tappable. After this action, the \\'Select time\\' dialog should close, and the \\'New Event\\' screen should show the updated start time. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'OK\\' button in the \\'Select time\\' dialog was successful. The dialog closed, and the start time on the \\'New Event\\' screen was updated to \\'20:00\\'. The end time also shows \\'20:00\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully setting the event\\'s start time.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[514,891],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the end time \\'20:00\\' (located at approximately `[514, 891]`, within bounding box `[505, 836, 524, 946]`) to open the time picker dialog. The current end time is \\'20:00\\'. After tapping, a time picker should appear, allowing me to set the end time to 20:30. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the end time \\'20:00\\' (at `[514, 891]`) was successful. A \\'Select time\\' dialog appeared, overlaying the \\'New Event\\' screen. The dialog is currently set to select the end time and shows \\'20:00\\', with the hour \\'20\\' actively selected (highlighted on the clock face and in the digital display). This indicates the dialog is in hour selection mode. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing the interface to change the event\\'s end time.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[340,647],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'00\\' minutes display (center at approximately `[340, 647]`, within bounding box `[312, 564, 368, 730]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog to switch to minute selection mode. The dialog is currently in hour selection mode for the end time. After this action, the dialog should switch to minute selection mode, allowing me to select \\'30\\' for the minutes. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'00\\' minutes display (at `[340, 647]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog was successful. The dialog switched from hour selection mode to minute selection mode. The clock face now displays minute options, and the minute part of the digital display (\\'00\\') is highlighted, ready for selection. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing the selection of the minutes for the event\\'s end time.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The event should last for 30 mins.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[454,891],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the start time \\'16:00\\' (located at approximately `[454, 891]`, within bounding box `[444, 836, 463, 946]`) to open the time picker dialog. The current start time is \\'16:00\\'. After tapping, a time picker should appear, allowing me to set the start time to 20:00. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the start time \\'16:00\\' (at `[454, 891]`) was successful. A \\'Select time\\' dialog (time picker) appeared, overlaying the \\'New Event\\' screen. The time picker currently shows \\'16:00\\' selected. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing the interface to change the event\\'s start time.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[601,362],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the number \\'20\\' on the clock face (center at approximately `[601, 362]`) to select 20 as the hour for the event start time. The number \\'20\\' is currently not selected. After this action, the hour display at the top should change from \\'16\\' to \\'20\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'20\\' on the clock face (at `[601, 362]`) was successful. The hour displayed in the \\'Select time\\' dialog changed from \\'16\\' to \\'20\\'. The dialog then automatically switched to minute selection mode, with \\'00\\' minutes pre-selected. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by correctly setting the start hour for the event.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[760,774],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button (center at approximately `[760, 774]`, bounding box `[753, 750, 767, 799]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog to confirm the start time of 20:00. The \\'OK\\' button is currently visible and tappable. After this action, the \\'Select time\\' dialog should close, and the \\'New Event\\' screen should show the updated start time. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'OK\\' button in the \\'Select time\\' dialog was successful. The dialog closed, and the start time on the \\'New Event\\' screen was updated to \\'20:00\\'. The end time also shows \\'20:00\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully setting the event\\'s start time.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[514,891],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the end time \\'20:00\\' (located at approximately `[514, 891]`, within bounding box `[505, 836, 524, 946]`) to open the time picker dialog. The current end time is \\'20:00\\'. After tapping, a time picker should appear, allowing me to set the end time to 20:30. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the end time \\'20:00\\' (at `[514, 891]`) was successful. A \\'Select time\\' dialog appeared, overlaying the \\'New Event\\' screen. The dialog is currently set to select the end time and shows \\'20:00\\', with the hour \\'20\\' actively selected (highlighted on the clock face and in the digital display). This indicates the dialog is in hour selection mode. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing the interface to change the event\\'s end time.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[340,647],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'00\\' minutes display (center at approximately `[340, 647]`, within bounding box `[312, 564, 368, 730]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog to switch to minute selection mode. The dialog is currently in hour selection mode for the end time. After this action, the dialog should switch to minute selection mode, allowing me to select \\'30\\' for the minutes. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'00\\' minutes display (at `[340, 647]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog was successful. The dialog switched from hour selection mode to minute selection mode. The clock face now displays minute options, and the minute part of the digital display (\\'00\\') is highlighted, ready for selection. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing the selection of the minutes for the event\\'s end time.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 13: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

The dialog is currently in minute selection mode for the end time, showing \\'20:00\\'. After this action, the minutes should change to \\'30\\', and the time displayed should become \\'20:30\\'.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The number \\'20\\' is currently not selected. After this action, the hour display at the top should change from \\'16\\' to \\'20\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'20\\' on the clock face (at `[601, 362]`) was successful. The hour displayed in the \\'Select time\\' dialog changed from \\'16\\' to \\'20\\'. The dialog then automatically switched to minute selection mode, with \\'00\\' minutes pre-selected. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by correctly setting the start hour for the event.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[760,774],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button (center at approximately `[760, 774]`, bounding box `[753, 750, 767, 799]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog to confirm the start time of 20:00. The \\'OK\\' button is currently visible and tappable. After this action, the \\'Select time\\' dialog should close, and the \\'New Event\\' screen should show the updated start time. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'OK\\' button in the \\'Select time\\' dialog was successful. The dialog closed, and the start time on the \\'New Event\\' screen was updated to \\'20:00\\'. The end time also shows \\'20:00\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully setting the event\\'s start time.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[514,891],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the end time \\'20:00\\' (located at approximately `[514, 891]`, within bounding box `[505, 836, 524, 946]`) to open the time picker dialog. The current end time is \\'20:00\\'. After tapping, a time picker should appear, allowing me to set the end time to 20:30. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the end time \\'20:00\\' (at `[514, 891]`) was successful. A \\'Select time\\' dialog appeared, overlaying the \\'New Event\\' screen. The dialog is currently set to select the end time and shows \\'20:00\\', with the hour \\'20\\' actively selected (highlighted on the clock face and in the digital display). This indicates the dialog is in hour selection mode. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing the interface to change the event\\'s end time.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[340,647],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'00\\' minutes display (center at approximately `[340, 647]`, within bounding box `[312, 564, 368, 730]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog to switch to minute selection mode. The dialog is currently in hour selection mode for the end time. After this action, the dialog should switch to minute selection mode, allowing me to select \\'30\\' for the minutes. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'00\\' minutes display (at `[340, 647]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog was successful. The dialog switched from hour selection mode to minute selection mode. The clock face now displays minute options, and the minute part of the digital display (\\'00\\') is highlighted, ready for selection. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing the selection of the minutes for the event\\'s end time.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[674,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'30\\' on the clock face (center at approximately `[674, 501]`, within bounding box `[666, 477, 682, 525]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog. The dialog is currently in minute selection mode for the end time, showing \\'20:00\\'. After this action, the minutes should change to \\'30\\', and the time displayed should become \\'20:30\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'30\\' on the clock face (at `[674, 501]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog was successful. The minutes in the dialog changed from \\'00\\' to \\'30\\', and the displayed end time is now \\'20:30\\'.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The event should last for 30 mins.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[601,362],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the number \\'20\\' on the clock face (center at approximately `[601, 362]`) to select 20 as the hour for the event start time. The number \\'20\\' is currently not selected. After this action, the hour display at the top should change from \\'16\\' to \\'20\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'20\\' on the clock face (at `[601, 362]`) was successful. The hour displayed in the \\'Select time\\' dialog changed from \\'16\\' to \\'20\\'. The dialog then automatically switched to minute selection mode, with \\'00\\' minutes pre-selected. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by correctly setting the start hour for the event.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[760,774],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button (center at approximately `[760, 774]`, bounding box `[753, 750, 767, 799]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog to confirm the start time of 20:00. The \\'OK\\' button is currently visible and tappable. After this action, the \\'Select time\\' dialog should close, and the \\'New Event\\' screen should show the updated start time. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'OK\\' button in the \\'Select time\\' dialog was successful. The dialog closed, and the start time on the \\'New Event\\' screen was updated to \\'20:00\\'. The end time also shows \\'20:00\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully setting the event\\'s start time.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[514,891],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the end time \\'20:00\\' (located at approximately `[514, 891]`, within bounding box `[505, 836, 524, 946]`) to open the time picker dialog. The current end time is \\'20:00\\'. After tapping, a time picker should appear, allowing me to set the end time to 20:30. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the end time \\'20:00\\' (at `[514, 891]`) was successful. A \\'Select time\\' dialog appeared, overlaying the \\'New Event\\' screen. The dialog is currently set to select the end time and shows \\'20:00\\', with the hour \\'20\\' actively selected (highlighted on the clock face and in the digital display). This indicates the dialog is in hour selection mode. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing the interface to change the event\\'s end time.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[340,647],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'00\\' minutes display (center at approximately `[340, 647]`, within bounding box `[312, 564, 368, 730]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog to switch to minute selection mode. The dialog is currently in hour selection mode for the end time. After this action, the dialog should switch to minute selection mode, allowing me to select \\'30\\' for the minutes. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'00\\' minutes display (at `[340, 647]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog was successful. The dialog switched from hour selection mode to minute selection mode. The clock face now displays minute options, and the minute part of the digital display (\\'00\\') is highlighted, ready for selection. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing the selection of the minutes for the event\\'s end time.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[674,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'30\\' on the clock face (center at approximately `[674, 501]`, within bounding box `[666, 477, 682, 525]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog. The dialog is currently in minute selection mode for the end time, showing \\'20:00\\'. After this action, the minutes should change to \\'30\\', and the time displayed should become \\'20:30\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'30\\' on the clock face (at `[674, 501]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog was successful. The minutes in the dialog changed from \\'00\\' to \\'30\\', and the displayed end time is now \\'20:30\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by correctly setting the minutes for the event\\'s end time.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 14: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[760,774],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button (center at approximately `[760, 774]`, bounding box `[753, 750, 767, 799]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog to confirm the end time of 20:30. The \\'OK\\' button is currently visible and tappable. After this action, the \\'Select time\\' dialog should close, and the \\'New Event\\' screen should show the updated end time.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The \\'OK\\' button is currently visible and tappable. After this action, the \\'Select time\\' dialog should close, and the \\'New Event\\' screen should show the updated start time. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'OK\\' button in the \\'Select time\\' dialog was successful. The dialog closed, and the start time on the \\'New Event\\' screen was updated to \\'20:00\\'. The end time also shows \\'20:00\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully setting the event\\'s start time.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[514,891],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the end time \\'20:00\\' (located at approximately `[514, 891]`, within bounding box `[505, 836, 524, 946]`) to open the time picker dialog. The current end time is \\'20:00\\'. After tapping, a time picker should appear, allowing me to set the end time to 20:30. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the end time \\'20:00\\' (at `[514, 891]`) was successful. A \\'Select time\\' dialog appeared, overlaying the \\'New Event\\' screen. The dialog is currently set to select the end time and shows \\'20:00\\', with the hour \\'20\\' actively selected (highlighted on the clock face and in the digital display). This indicates the dialog is in hour selection mode. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing the interface to change the event\\'s end time.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[340,647],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'00\\' minutes display (center at approximately `[340, 647]`, within bounding box `[312, 564, 368, 730]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog to switch to minute selection mode. The dialog is currently in hour selection mode for the end time. After this action, the dialog should switch to minute selection mode, allowing me to select \\'30\\' for the minutes. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'00\\' minutes display (at `[340, 647]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog was successful. The dialog switched from hour selection mode to minute selection mode. The clock face now displays minute options, and the minute part of the digital display (\\'00\\') is highlighted, ready for selection. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing the selection of the minutes for the event\\'s end time.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

The dialog is currently in minute selection mode for the end time, showing \\'20:00\\'. After this action, the minutes should change to \\'30\\', and the time displayed should become \\'20:30\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'30\\' on the clock face (at `[674, 501]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog was successful. The minutes in the dialog changed from \\'00\\' to \\'30\\', and the displayed end time is now \\'20:30\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by correctly setting the minutes for the event\\'s end time.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[760,774],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button (center at approximately `[760, 774]`, bounding box `[753, 750, 767, 799]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog to confirm the end time of 20:30. The \\'OK\\' button is currently visible and tappable. After this action, the \\'Select time\\' dialog should close, and the \\'New Event\\' screen should show the updated end time. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'OK\\' button in the \\'Select time\\' dialog was successful. The dialog closed, and the end time on the \\'New Event\\' screen was updated to \\'20:30\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully setting the event\\'s end time.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.44\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [79, 145, 101, 390], \\'text\\': \\'New Event\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [155, 45, 175, 392], \\'text\\': \\'Call with the Team\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [221, 45, 240, 213], \\'text\\': \\'Location\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [287, 45, 310, 266], \\'text\\': \\'Description\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [375, 142, 402, 282], \\'text\\': \\'All-day\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [443, 143, 467, 480], \\'text\\': \\'October 16 (Mon)\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [444, 836, 463, 946], \\'text\\': \\'20.00\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [503, 144, 527, 480], \\'text\\': \\'October 16 (Mon)\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [505, 836, 524, 946], \\'text\\': \\'20.30\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [583, 145, 602, 488], \\'text\\': \\'10 minutes before\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [643, 147, 662, 555], \\'text\\': \\'Add another reminder\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [713, 53, 742, 394], \\'text\\': \\'\u00d6 No repetition\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [788, 143, 814, 406], \\'text\\': \\'Regular event\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [860, 145, 879, 361], \\'text\\': \\'Event color\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [849, 871, 894, 966]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [372, 48, 403, 282]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [363, 864, 422, 977]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [215, 878, 253, 936]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"Description\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nIn Simple Calendar Pro, create a calendar event for tomorrow at 20h with the title \\'Call with the Team\\' and the description \\'We will prepare for team roles.\\'. The event should last for 30 mins.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[760,774],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button (center at approximately `[760, 774]`, bounding box `[753, 750, 767, 799]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog to confirm the start time of 20:00. The \\'OK\\' button is currently visible and tappable. After this action, the \\'Select time\\' dialog should close, and the \\'New Event\\' screen should show the updated start time. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'OK\\' button in the \\'Select time\\' dialog was successful. The dialog closed, and the start time on the \\'New Event\\' screen was updated to \\'20:00\\'. The end time also shows \\'20:00\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully setting the event\\'s start time.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[514,891],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the end time \\'20:00\\' (located at approximately `[514, 891]`, within bounding box `[505, 836, 524, 946]`) to open the time picker dialog. The current end time is \\'20:00\\'. After tapping, a time picker should appear, allowing me to set the end time to 20:30. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the end time \\'20:00\\' (at `[514, 891]`) was successful. A \\'Select time\\' dialog appeared, overlaying the \\'New Event\\' screen. The dialog is currently set to select the end time and shows \\'20:00\\', with the hour \\'20\\' actively selected (highlighted on the clock face and in the digital display). This indicates the dialog is in hour selection mode. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing the interface to change the event\\'s end time.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[340,647],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'00\\' minutes display (center at approximately `[340, 647]`, within bounding box `[312, 564, 368, 730]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog to switch to minute selection mode. The dialog is currently in hour selection mode for the end time. After this action, the dialog should switch to minute selection mode, allowing me to select \\'30\\' for the minutes. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'00\\' minutes display (at `[340, 647]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog was successful. The dialog switched from hour selection mode to minute selection mode. The clock face now displays minute options, and the minute part of the digital display (\\'00\\') is highlighted, ready for selection. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing the selection of the minutes for the event\\'s end time.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[674,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'30\\' on the clock face (center at approximately `[674, 501]`, within bounding box `[666, 477, 682, 525]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog. The dialog is currently in minute selection mode for the end time, showing \\'20:00\\'. After this action, the minutes should change to \\'30\\', and the time displayed should become \\'20:30\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'30\\' on the clock face (at `[674, 501]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog was successful. The minutes in the dialog changed from \\'00\\' to \\'30\\', and the displayed end time is now \\'20:30\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by correctly setting the minutes for the event\\'s end time.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[760,774],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button (center at approximately `[760, 774]`, bounding box `[753, 750, 767, 799]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog to confirm the end time of 20:30. The \\'OK\\' button is currently visible and tappable. After this action, the \\'Select time\\' dialog should close, and the \\'New Event\\' screen should show the updated end time. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'OK\\' button in the \\'Select time\\' dialog was successful. The dialog closed, and the end time on the \\'New Event\\' screen was updated to \\'20:30\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully setting the event\\'s end time.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 15: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[298,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Description\\' field (located around `[298, 500]`, below the \\'Description\\' label at `[287, 45, 310, 266]`) to select it for text input. The field is currently empty or showing placeholder text. After tapping, the field should become focused, and the virtual keyboard should appear, allowing text input for the event description.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[514,891],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the end time \\'20:00\\' (located at approximately `[514, 891]`, within bounding box `[505, 836, 524, 946]`) to open the time picker dialog. The current end time is \\'20:00\\'. After tapping, a time picker should appear, allowing me to set the end time to 20:30. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the end time \\'20:00\\' (at `[514, 891]`) was successful. A \\'Select time\\' dialog appeared, overlaying the \\'New Event\\' screen. The dialog is currently set to select the end time and shows \\'20:00\\', with the hour \\'20\\' actively selected (highlighted on the clock face and in the digital display). This indicates the dialog is in hour selection mode. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing the interface to change the event\\'s end time.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[340,647],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'00\\' minutes display (center at approximately `[340, 647]`, within bounding box `[312, 564, 368, 730]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog to switch to minute selection mode. The dialog is currently in hour selection mode for the end time. After this action, the dialog should switch to minute selection mode, allowing me to select \\'30\\' for the minutes. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'00\\' minutes display (at `[340, 647]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog was successful. The dialog switched from hour selection mode to minute selection mode. The clock face now displays minute options, and the minute part of the digital display (\\'00\\') is highlighted, ready for selection. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing the selection of the minutes for the event\\'s end time.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[674,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'30\\' on the clock face (center at approximately `[674, 501]`, within bounding box `[666, 477, 682, 525]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog. The dialog is currently in minute selection mode for the end time, showing \\'20:00\\'. After this action, the minutes should change to \\'30\\', and the time displayed should become \\'20:30\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'30\\' on the clock face (at `[674, 501]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog was successful. The minutes in the dialog changed from \\'00\\' to \\'30\\', and the displayed end time is now \\'20:30\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by correctly setting the minutes for the event\\'s end time.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[760,774],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button (center at approximately `[760, 774]`, bounding box `[753, 750, 767, 799]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog to confirm the end time of 20:30. The \\'OK\\' button is currently visible and tappable. After this action, the \\'Select time\\' dialog should close, and the \\'New Event\\' screen should show the updated end time. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'OK\\' button in the \\'Select time\\' dialog was successful. The dialog closed, and the end time on the \\'New Event\\' screen was updated to \\'20:30\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully setting the event\\'s end time.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[298,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Description\\' field (located around `[298, 500]`, below the \\'Description\\' label at `[287, 45, 310, 266]`) to select it for text input. The field is currently empty or showing placeholder text. After tapping, the field should become focused, and the virtual keyboard should appear, allowing text input for the event description. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Description\\' field (at `[298, 500]`) was successful. The \\'Description\\' field is now focused, as indicated by the appearance of the virtual keyboard (\\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\') at the bottom of the screen. The placeholder text \\'Description\\' is still visible in the field, and the field is ready for text input. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling text input for the event description.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.44\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [79, 145, 101, 390], \\'text\\': \\'New Event\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [155, 45, 175, 392], \\'text\\': \\'Call with the Team\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [221, 45, 240, 213], \\'text\\': \\'Location\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [284, 42, 310, 267], \\'text\\': \\'pescription\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [375, 142, 402, 282], \\'text\\': \\'All-day\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [443, 143, 467, 480], \\'text\\': \\'October 16 (Mon)\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [444, 836, 463, 946], \\'text\\': \\'20.00\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [503, 144, 527, 480], \\'text\\': \\'October 16 (Mon)\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [505, 836, 524, 946], \\'text\\': \\'20.30\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [583, 145, 602, 488], \\'text\\': \\'10 minutes before\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [643, 147, 662, 555], \\'text\\': \\'Add another reminder\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [713, 53, 742, 394], \\'text\\': \\'\u00d6 No repetition\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [788, 143, 814, 406], \\'text\\': \\'Regular event\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [860, 145, 879, 361], \\'text\\': \\'Event color\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [849, 873, 895, 966]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [215, 878, 253, 936]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"3\", text=\"Description\", resource-id=\"com.simplemobiletools.calendar.pro:id/event_description\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"com.simplemobiletools.calendar.pro\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[42,654][1038,770]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"Description\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The event should last for 30 mins.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[514,891],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the end time \\'20:00\\' (located at approximately `[514, 891]`, within bounding box `[505, 836, 524, 946]`) to open the time picker dialog. The current end time is \\'20:00\\'. After tapping, a time picker should appear, allowing me to set the end time to 20:30. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the end time \\'20:00\\' (at `[514, 891]`) was successful. A \\'Select time\\' dialog appeared, overlaying the \\'New Event\\' screen. The dialog is currently set to select the end time and shows \\'20:00\\', with the hour \\'20\\' actively selected (highlighted on the clock face and in the digital display). This indicates the dialog is in hour selection mode. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing the interface to change the event\\'s end time.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[340,647],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'00\\' minutes display (center at approximately `[340, 647]`, within bounding box `[312, 564, 368, 730]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog to switch to minute selection mode. The dialog is currently in hour selection mode for the end time. After this action, the dialog should switch to minute selection mode, allowing me to select \\'30\\' for the minutes. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'00\\' minutes display (at `[340, 647]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog was successful. The dialog switched from hour selection mode to minute selection mode. The clock face now displays minute options, and the minute part of the digital display (\\'00\\') is highlighted, ready for selection. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing the selection of the minutes for the event\\'s end time.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[674,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'30\\' on the clock face (center at approximately `[674, 501]`, within bounding box `[666, 477, 682, 525]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog. The dialog is currently in minute selection mode for the end time, showing \\'20:00\\'. After this action, the minutes should change to \\'30\\', and the time displayed should become \\'20:30\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'30\\' on the clock face (at `[674, 501]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog was successful. The minutes in the dialog changed from \\'00\\' to \\'30\\', and the displayed end time is now \\'20:30\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by correctly setting the minutes for the event\\'s end time.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[760,774],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button (center at approximately `[760, 774]`, bounding box `[753, 750, 767, 799]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog to confirm the end time of 20:30. The \\'OK\\' button is currently visible and tappable. After this action, the \\'Select time\\' dialog should close, and the \\'New Event\\' screen should show the updated end time. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'OK\\' button in the \\'Select time\\' dialog was successful. The dialog closed, and the end time on the \\'New Event\\' screen was updated to \\'20:30\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully setting the event\\'s end time.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[298,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Description\\' field (located around `[298, 500]`, below the \\'Description\\' label at `[287, 45, 310, 266]`) to select it for text input. The field is currently empty or showing placeholder text. After tapping, the field should become focused, and the virtual keyboard should appear, allowing text input for the event description. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Description\\' field (at `[298, 500]`) was successful. The \\'Description\\' field is now focused, as indicated by the appearance of the virtual keyboard (\\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\') at the bottom of the screen. The placeholder text \\'Description\\' is still visible in the field, and the field is ready for text input. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling text input for the event description.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 16: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"We will prepare for team roles.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'We will prepare for team roles.\\' into the currently focused \\'Description\\' field. The field currently shows \\'Description\\' as placeholder text. After this action, the \\'Description\\' field should contain \\'We will prepare for team roles.\\'.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The dialog is currently in hour selection mode for the end time. After this action, the dialog should switch to minute selection mode, allowing me to select \\'30\\' for the minutes. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'00\\' minutes display (at `[340, 647]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog was successful. The dialog switched from hour selection mode to minute selection mode. The clock face now displays minute options, and the minute part of the digital display (\\'00\\') is highlighted, ready for selection. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing the selection of the minutes for the event\\'s end time.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[674,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'30\\' on the clock face (center at approximately `[674, 501]`, within bounding box `[666, 477, 682, 525]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog. The dialog is currently in minute selection mode for the end time, showing \\'20:00\\'. After this action, the minutes should change to \\'30\\', and the time displayed should become \\'20:30\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'30\\' on the clock face (at `[674, 501]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog was successful. The minutes in the dialog changed from \\'00\\' to \\'30\\', and the displayed end time is now \\'20:30\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by correctly setting the minutes for the event\\'s end time.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[760,774],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button (center at approximately `[760, 774]`, bounding box `[753, 750, 767, 799]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog to confirm the end time of 20:30. The \\'OK\\' button is currently visible and tappable. After this action, the \\'Select time\\' dialog should close, and the \\'New Event\\' screen should show the updated end time. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'OK\\' button in the \\'Select time\\' dialog was successful. The dialog closed, and the end time on the \\'New Event\\' screen was updated to \\'20:30\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully setting the event\\'s end time.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[298,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Description\\' field (located around `[298, 500]`, below the \\'Description\\' label at `[287, 45, 310, 266]`) to select it for text input. The field is currently empty or showing placeholder text. After tapping, the field should become focused, and the virtual keyboard should appear, allowing text input for the event description. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Description\\' field (at `[298, 500]`) was successful. The \\'Description\\' field is now focused, as indicated by the appearance of the virtual keyboard (\\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\') at the bottom of the screen. The placeholder text \\'Description\\' is still visible in the field, and the field is ready for text input. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling text input for the event description.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"We will prepare for team roles.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'We will prepare for team roles.\\' into the currently focused \\'Description\\' field. The field currently shows \\'Description\\' as placeholder text. After this action, the \\'Description\\' field should contain \\'We will prepare for team roles.\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'We will prepare for team roles.\\' into the \\'Description\\' field was successful. The text is now present in the \\'Description\\' field on the \\'New Event\\' screen. This completes the entry of all required event details, thus completing the active subgoal (ID 4).\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"We will prepare for team roles.\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[340,647],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'00\\' minutes display (center at approximately `[340, 647]`, within bounding box `[312, 564, 368, 730]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog to switch to minute selection mode. The dialog is currently in hour selection mode for the end time. After this action, the dialog should switch to minute selection mode, allowing me to select \\'30\\' for the minutes. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'00\\' minutes display (at `[340, 647]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog was successful. The dialog switched from hour selection mode to minute selection mode. The clock face now displays minute options, and the minute part of the digital display (\\'00\\') is highlighted, ready for selection. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing the selection of the minutes for the event\\'s end time.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[674,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'30\\' on the clock face (center at approximately `[674, 501]`, within bounding box `[666, 477, 682, 525]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog. The dialog is currently in minute selection mode for the end time, showing \\'20:00\\'. After this action, the minutes should change to \\'30\\', and the time displayed should become \\'20:30\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'30\\' on the clock face (at `[674, 501]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog was successful. The minutes in the dialog changed from \\'00\\' to \\'30\\', and the displayed end time is now \\'20:30\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by correctly setting the minutes for the event\\'s end time.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[760,774],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button (center at approximately `[760, 774]`, bounding box `[753, 750, 767, 799]`) in the \\'Select time\\' dialog to confirm the end time of 20:30. The \\'OK\\' button is currently visible and tappable. After this action, the \\'Select time\\' dialog should close, and the \\'New Event\\' screen should show the updated end time. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'OK\\' button in the \\'Select time\\' dialog was successful. The dialog closed, and the end time on the \\'New Event\\' screen was updated to \\'20:30\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully setting the event\\'s end time.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[298,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Description\\' field (located around `[298, 500]`, below the \\'Description\\' label at `[287, 45, 310, 266]`) to select it for text input. The field is currently empty or showing placeholder text. After tapping, the field should become focused, and the virtual keyboard should appear, allowing text input for the event description. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Description\\' field (at `[298, 500]`) was successful. The \\'Description\\' field is now focused, as indicated by the appearance of the virtual keyboard (\\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\') at the bottom of the screen. The placeholder text \\'Description\\' is still visible in the field, and the field is ready for text input. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling text input for the event description.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"We will prepare for team roles.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'We will prepare for team roles.\\' into the currently focused \\'Description\\' field. The field currently shows \\'Description\\' as placeholder text. After this action, the \\'Description\\' field should contain \\'We will prepare for team roles.\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'We will prepare for team roles.\\' into the \\'Description\\' field was successful. The text is now present in the \\'Description\\' field on the \\'New Event\\' screen. This completes the entry of all required event details, thus completing the active subgoal (ID 4).\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 17: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",
