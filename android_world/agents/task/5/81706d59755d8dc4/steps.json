Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [123, 84, 148, 345], \\'text\\': \\'Sun; Oct 15\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 336, 722, 431], \\'text\\': \\'Gmail\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 561, 722, 676], \\'text\\': \\'Photos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [704, 781, 722, 921], \\'text\\': \\'YouTube\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [771, 295, 872, 722], \\'text\\': \\'0 0\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 72, 855, 233]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [788, 765, 856, 929]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 298, 857, 466]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 536, 729, 695]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 535, 858, 705]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 763, 728, 928]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 299, 731, 463]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [900, 702, 947, 794]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [893, 802, 952, 921]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right.

The screen remained on the home screen. The action was a failure as it did not bring the agent closer to opening the Broccoli app. To correct this, another attempt to open the app drawer via a swipe up will be made.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[850,500],\"end_point\":[150,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the lower-middle part of the screen (start_point: [850, 500]) to the upper-middle part of the screen (end_point: [150, 500]) to open the app drawer. This is the second attempt to open the app drawer to find and open the \\'Broccoli\\' app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [850, 500] to [150, 500] successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'Broccoli\\' app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

This action is expected to launch the Broccoli app. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Broccoli\\' app icon successfully opened the Broccoli app. The screen changed from the app drawer to the main interface of the Broccoli app, which is titled \\'Recipes\\' and lists several recipes. This action directly contributed to completing Subgoal 1, as the app is now open.

This action is taken to find and open the \\'Broccoli\\' app as per the first subgoal. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900, 500] to [100, 500] did not open the app drawer. The screen remained on the home screen. The action was a failure as it did not bring the agent closer to opening the Broccoli app. To correct this, another attempt to open the app drawer via a swipe up will be made.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[850,500],\"end_point\":[150,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the lower-middle part of the screen (start_point: [850, 500]) to the upper-middle part of the screen (end_point: [150, 500]) to open the app drawer. This is the second attempt to open the app drawer to find and open the \\'Broccoli\\' app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [850, 500] to [150, 500] successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'Broccoli\\' app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[380,614],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Broccoli\\' app icon, which is located at approximately [380, 614], to open the app. The \\'Broccoli\\' app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. This action is expected to launch the Broccoli app. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Broccoli\\' app icon successfully opened the Broccoli app. The screen changed from the app drawer to the main interface of the Broccoli app, which is titled \\'Recipes\\' and lists several recipes. This action directly contributed to completing Subgoal 1, as the app is now open.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is taken to find and open the \\'Broccoli\\' app as per the first subgoal. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900, 500] to [100, 500] did not open the app drawer. The screen remained on the home screen. The action was a failure as it did not bring the agent closer to opening the Broccoli app. To correct this, another attempt to open the app drawer via a swipe up will be made.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[850,500],\"end_point\":[150,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the lower-middle part of the screen (start_point: [850, 500]) to the upper-middle part of the screen (end_point: [150, 500]) to open the app drawer. This is the second attempt to open the app drawer to find and open the \\'Broccoli\\' app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [850, 500] to [150, 500] successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'Broccoli\\' app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[380,614],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Broccoli\\' app icon, which is located at approximately [380, 614], to open the app. The \\'Broccoli\\' app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. This action is expected to launch the Broccoli app. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Broccoli\\' app icon successfully opened the Broccoli app. The screen changed from the app drawer to the main interface of the Broccoli app, which is titled \\'Recipes\\' and lists several recipes. This action directly contributed to completing Subgoal 1, as the app is now open. The agent is closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[521,616],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe entry, which is located around [521, 616]. This action is performed to check if a contextual menu with a \\'Delete\\' option appears, as part of determining the recipe deletion method. Actual Outcome: The long press on the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe entry at [521, 616] did not reveal a contextual delete menu. Instead, it opened the details page for this recipe. The screen changed from the recipe list to the specific recipe\\'s details. This action clarified that long-pressing from the list view is not the deletion method and has moved the agent to the recipe details page, which is the next step in exploring deletion methods. The agent is closer to identifying how to delete recipes.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.37\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'[Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 181, 96, 771], \\'text\\': \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pe..\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [137, 37, 162, 725], \\'text\\': \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [187, 108, 200, 129], \\'text\\': \\'8\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [183, 130, 205, 271], \\'text\\': \\'servings\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [186, 483, 201, 537], \\'text\\': \\'hrs\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [225, 65, 246, 855], \\'text\\': \\'delicious and healthy choice for any time of the day.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [267, 32, 322, 346], \\'text\\': \\'Ingredients optional ingredients\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [342, 36, 362, 238], \\'text\\': \\'Directions\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [376, 88, 448, 901], \\'text\\': \\'Spiralize zucchini into noodles; saute with garlic; then mix with pesto sauce.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is taken to find and open the \\'Broccoli\\' app as per the first subgoal. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900, 500] to [100, 500] did not open the app drawer. The screen remained on the home screen. The action was a failure as it did not bring the agent closer to opening the Broccoli app. To correct this, another attempt to open the app drawer via a swipe up will be made.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[850,500],\"end_point\":[150,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the lower-middle part of the screen (start_point: [850, 500]) to the upper-middle part of the screen (end_point: [150, 500]) to open the app drawer. This is the second attempt to open the app drawer to find and open the \\'Broccoli\\' app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [850, 500] to [150, 500] successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'Broccoli\\' app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[380,614],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Broccoli\\' app icon, which is located at approximately [380, 614], to open the app. The \\'Broccoli\\' app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. This action is expected to launch the Broccoli app. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Broccoli\\' app icon successfully opened the Broccoli app. The screen changed from the app drawer to the main interface of the Broccoli app, which is titled \\'Recipes\\' and lists several recipes. This action directly contributed to completing Subgoal 1, as the app is now open. The agent is closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[521,616],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe entry, which is located around [521, 616]. This action is performed to check if a contextual menu with a \\'Delete\\' option appears, as part of determining the recipe deletion method. Actual Outcome: The long press on the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe entry at [521, 616] did not reveal a contextual delete menu. Instead, it opened the details page for this recipe. The screen changed from the recipe list to the specific recipe\\'s details. This action clarified that long-pressing from the list view is not the deletion method and has moved the agent to the recipe details page, which is the next step in exploring deletion methods. The agent is closer to identifying how to delete recipes.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 4: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approximate center [84, 943]). This icon is currently visible on the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe details page. This action is taken to check if a \\'Delete\\' option is available within this menu, as part of identifying the recipe deletion method.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution.

This action is taken to find and open the \\'Broccoli\\' app as per the first subgoal. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900, 500] to [100, 500] did not open the app drawer. The screen remained on the home screen. The action was a failure as it did not bring the agent closer to opening the Broccoli app. To correct this, another attempt to open the app drawer via a swipe up will be made.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[850,500],\"end_point\":[150,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the lower-middle part of the screen (start_point: [850, 500]) to the upper-middle part of the screen (end_point: [150, 500]) to open the app drawer. This is the second attempt to open the app drawer to find and open the \\'Broccoli\\' app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [850, 500] to [150, 500] successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'Broccoli\\' app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[380,614],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Broccoli\\' app icon, which is located at approximately [380, 614], to open the app. The \\'Broccoli\\' app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. This action is expected to launch the Broccoli app. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Broccoli\\' app icon successfully opened the Broccoli app. The screen changed from the app drawer to the main interface of the Broccoli app, which is titled \\'Recipes\\' and lists several recipes. This action directly contributed to completing Subgoal 1, as the app is now open. The agent is closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[521,616],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe entry, which is located around [521, 616]. This action is performed to check if a contextual menu with a \\'Delete\\' option appears, as part of determining the recipe deletion method. Actual Outcome: The long press on the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe entry at [521, 616] did not reveal a contextual delete menu. Instead, it opened the details page for this recipe. The screen changed from the recipe list to the specific recipe\\'s details. This action clarified that long-pressing from the list view is not the deletion method and has moved the agent to the recipe details page, which is the next step in exploring deletion methods. The agent is closer to identifying how to delete recipes.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approximate center [84, 943]). This icon is currently visible on the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe details page. This action is taken to check if a \\'Delete\\' option is available within this menu, as part of identifying the recipe deletion method. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dot menu icon (coordinates [84, 943]) was successful. It opened a context menu with four options: \"Share\", \"Share as file\", \"Edit\", and \"Delete\". This action brought the agent closer to completing the overall user instruction by identifying the method to delete recipes. The \"Delete\" option is now visible and can be interacted with in the next step.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 42, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.38\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'[Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \\'{\\\\\\'box_2d\\\\\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\\\\\'text\\\\\\': \"\\\\\\'Yv: 0.0\"}\\', \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 710, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'IPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 65, 948], \\'text\\': \\'ISize: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 182, 104, 659], \\'text\\': \\'Zucchini Noodl Share\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [137, 37, 162, 771], \\'text\\': \\'Zucchini Noodles wi Share as file\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [187, 108, 200, 129], \\'text\\': \\'8\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [183, 130, 205, 271], \\'text\\': \\'servings\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [186, 457, 207, 626], \\'text\\': \\'4 hr Edit\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [225, 65, 260, 668], \\'text\\': \\'delicious and healthy choice Delete\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [267, 32, 322, 346], \\'text\\': \\'Ingredients optional ingredients\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [342, 36, 362, 238], \\'text\\': \\'Directions\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [376, 88, 448, 901], \\'text\\': \\'Spiralize zucchini into noodles; saute with garlic; then mix with pesto sauce. Top with grated Parmesan cheese. Garnish with fresh herbs for a more vibrant taste.\\'}\", \\'{\\\\\\'box_2d\\\\\\': [912, 863, 939, 925], \\\\\\'text\\\\\\': \\\\\\'\"9\\\\\\'}\\']\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [895, 818, 957, 968]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [120, 518, 174, 995]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [179, 378, 213, 453]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 821, 37, 899]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 513, 119, 986]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 38, 242]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 903, 37, 945]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is taken to find and open the \\'Broccoli\\' app as per the first subgoal. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900, 500] to [100, 500] did not open the app drawer. The screen remained on the home screen. The action was a failure as it did not bring the agent closer to opening the Broccoli app. To correct this, another attempt to open the app drawer via a swipe up will be made.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[850,500],\"end_point\":[150,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the lower-middle part of the screen (start_point: [850, 500]) to the upper-middle part of the screen (end_point: [150, 500]) to open the app drawer. This is the second attempt to open the app drawer to find and open the \\'Broccoli\\' app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [850, 500] to [150, 500] successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'Broccoli\\' app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[380,614],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Broccoli\\' app icon, which is located at approximately [380, 614], to open the app. The \\'Broccoli\\' app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. This action is expected to launch the Broccoli app. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Broccoli\\' app icon successfully opened the Broccoli app. The screen changed from the app drawer to the main interface of the Broccoli app, which is titled \\'Recipes\\' and lists several recipes. This action directly contributed to completing Subgoal 1, as the app is now open. The agent is closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[521,616],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe entry, which is located around [521, 616]. This action is performed to check if a contextual menu with a \\'Delete\\' option appears, as part of determining the recipe deletion method. Actual Outcome: The long press on the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe entry at [521, 616] did not reveal a contextual delete menu. Instead, it opened the details page for this recipe. The screen changed from the recipe list to the specific recipe\\'s details. This action clarified that long-pressing from the list view is not the deletion method and has moved the agent to the recipe details page, which is the next step in exploring deletion methods. The agent is closer to identifying how to delete recipes.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approximate center [84, 943]). This icon is currently visible on the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe details page. This action is taken to check if a \\'Delete\\' option is available within this menu, as part of identifying the recipe deletion method. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dot menu icon (coordinates [84, 943]) was successful. It opened a context menu with four options: \"Share\", \"Share as file\", \"Edit\", and \"Delete\". This action brought the agent closer to completing the overall user instruction by identifying the method to delete recipes. The \"Delete\" option is now visible and can be interacted with in the next step.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 5: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[252,585],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Delete\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Delete\\' option is currently visible as the last item in the menu that appeared after tapping the three-dot icon. This action is expected to initiate the deletion of the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe, possibly by showing a confirmation dialog. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Broccoli App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'Broccoli\\' app is open and its main screen is visible. `BroccoliAppOpenedStatus` is updated to \\'Successfully opened\\' or \\'Not found\\'.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Attempted to swipe up from [900, 500] to [100, 500] to open the app drawer, but the app drawer did not open.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17.

This is the second attempt to open the app drawer to find and open the \\'Broccoli\\' app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [850, 500] to [150, 500] successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'Broccoli\\' app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[380,614],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Broccoli\\' app icon, which is located at approximately [380, 614], to open the app. The \\'Broccoli\\' app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. This action is expected to launch the Broccoli app. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Broccoli\\' app icon successfully opened the Broccoli app. The screen changed from the app drawer to the main interface of the Broccoli app, which is titled \\'Recipes\\' and lists several recipes. This action directly contributed to completing Subgoal 1, as the app is now open. The agent is closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[521,616],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe entry, which is located around [521, 616]. This action is performed to check if a contextual menu with a \\'Delete\\' option appears, as part of determining the recipe deletion method. Actual Outcome: The long press on the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe entry at [521, 616] did not reveal a contextual delete menu. Instead, it opened the details page for this recipe. The screen changed from the recipe list to the specific recipe\\'s details. This action clarified that long-pressing from the list view is not the deletion method and has moved the agent to the recipe details page, which is the next step in exploring deletion methods. The agent is closer to identifying how to delete recipes.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approximate center [84, 943]). This icon is currently visible on the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe details page. This action is taken to check if a \\'Delete\\' option is available within this menu, as part of identifying the recipe deletion method. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dot menu icon (coordinates [84, 943]) was successful. It opened a context menu with four options: \"Share\", \"Share as file\", \"Edit\", and \"Delete\". This action brought the agent closer to completing the overall user instruction by identifying the method to delete recipes. The \"Delete\" option is now visible and can be interacted with in the next step.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[252,585],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Delete\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Delete\\' option is currently visible as the last item in the menu that appeared after tapping the three-dot icon. This action is expected to initiate the deletion of the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe, possibly by showing a confirmation dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Delete\\' option (located around [252, 585] in the previous screen) was successful. It triggered a confirmation pop-up dialog with the message \\'Delete this recipe?\\' and two options: \\'CANCEL\\' and \\'DELETE\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to deleting the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe, as the next step is to confirm this deletion.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 42, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.39\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 181, 96, 771], \\'text\\': \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pe...\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [137, 37, 162, 725], \\'text\\': \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [187, 108, 200, 129], \\'text\\': \\'8\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [183, 130, 205, 271], \\'text\\': \\'servings\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [185, 483, 201, 537], \\'text\\': \\'hrs\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [225, 65, 246, 856], \\'text\\': \\'delicious and healthy choice for any time of the day:\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [269, 31, 322, 346], \\'text\\': \\'Ingredients optional ingredients\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [342, 36, 363, 240], \\'text\\': \\'Directions\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [376, 88, 448, 901], \\'text\\': \\'Spiralize zucchini into noodles, saute with garlic; then mix with pesto sauce.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is the second attempt to open the app drawer to find and open the \\'Broccoli\\' app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [850, 500] to [150, 500] successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, displaying a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'Broccoli\\' app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[380,614],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Broccoli\\' app icon, which is located at approximately [380, 614], to open the app. The \\'Broccoli\\' app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. This action is expected to launch the Broccoli app. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Broccoli\\' app icon successfully opened the Broccoli app. The screen changed from the app drawer to the main interface of the Broccoli app, which is titled \\'Recipes\\' and lists several recipes. This action directly contributed to completing Subgoal 1, as the app is now open. The agent is closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[521,616],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe entry, which is located around [521, 616]. This action is performed to check if a contextual menu with a \\'Delete\\' option appears, as part of determining the recipe deletion method. Actual Outcome: The long press on the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe entry at [521, 616] did not reveal a contextual delete menu. Instead, it opened the details page for this recipe. The screen changed from the recipe list to the specific recipe\\'s details. This action clarified that long-pressing from the list view is not the deletion method and has moved the agent to the recipe details page, which is the next step in exploring deletion methods. The agent is closer to identifying how to delete recipes.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approximate center [84, 943]). This icon is currently visible on the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe details page. This action is taken to check if a \\'Delete\\' option is available within this menu, as part of identifying the recipe deletion method. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dot menu icon (coordinates [84, 943]) was successful. It opened a context menu with four options: \"Share\", \"Share as file\", \"Edit\", and \"Delete\". This action brought the agent closer to completing the overall user instruction by identifying the method to delete recipes. The \"Delete\" option is now visible and can be interacted with in the next step.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[252,585],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Delete\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Delete\\' option is currently visible as the last item in the menu that appeared after tapping the three-dot icon. This action is expected to initiate the deletion of the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe, possibly by showing a confirmation dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Delete\\' option (located around [252, 585] in the previous screen) was successful. It triggered a confirmation pop-up dialog with the message \\'Delete this recipe?\\' and two options: \\'CANCEL\\' and \\'DELETE\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to deleting the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe, as the next step is to confirm this deletion.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 6: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[540,799],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'DELETE\\' button in the confirmation dialog. The \\'DELETE\\' button is currently visible on the screen. This action is expected to confirm the deletion of the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe and return to the previous screen, likely the recipe list.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[380,614],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Broccoli\\' app icon, which is located at approximately [380, 614], to open the app. The \\'Broccoli\\' app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. This action is expected to launch the Broccoli app. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Broccoli\\' app icon successfully opened the Broccoli app. The screen changed from the app drawer to the main interface of the Broccoli app, which is titled \\'Recipes\\' and lists several recipes. This action directly contributed to completing Subgoal 1, as the app is now open. The agent is closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[521,616],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe entry, which is located around [521, 616]. This action is performed to check if a contextual menu with a \\'Delete\\' option appears, as part of determining the recipe deletion method. Actual Outcome: The long press on the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe entry at [521, 616] did not reveal a contextual delete menu. Instead, it opened the details page for this recipe. The screen changed from the recipe list to the specific recipe\\'s details. This action clarified that long-pressing from the list view is not the deletion method and has moved the agent to the recipe details page, which is the next step in exploring deletion methods. The agent is closer to identifying how to delete recipes.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approximate center [84, 943]). This icon is currently visible on the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe details page. This action is taken to check if a \\'Delete\\' option is available within this menu, as part of identifying the recipe deletion method. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dot menu icon (coordinates [84, 943]) was successful. It opened a context menu with four options: \"Share\", \"Share as file\", \"Edit\", and \"Delete\". This action brought the agent closer to completing the overall user instruction by identifying the method to delete recipes. The \"Delete\" option is now visible and can be interacted with in the next step.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[252,585],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Delete\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Delete\\' option is currently visible as the last item in the menu that appeared after tapping the three-dot icon. This action is expected to initiate the deletion of the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe, possibly by showing a confirmation dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Delete\\' option (located around [252, 585] in the previous screen) was successful. It triggered a confirmation pop-up dialog with the message \\'Delete this recipe?\\' and two options: \\'CANCEL\\' and \\'DELETE\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to deleting the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe, as the next step is to confirm this deletion.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[540,799],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'DELETE\\' button in the confirmation dialog. The \\'DELETE\\' button is currently visible on the screen. This action is expected to confirm the deletion of the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe and return to the previous screen, likely the recipe list. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'DELETE\\' button (coordinates [540, 799] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe was deleted, and the app returned to the \\'All recipes\\' list. The recipe is no longer visible, confirming the deletion. This action completed the active subgoal of deleting \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.40\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'[Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 169, 101, 361], \\'text\\': \\'Recipes\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [135, 38, 162, 278], \\'text\\': \\'All recipes\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [205, 325, 275, 907], \\'text\\': \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp delicious and healthy choice for any time of the day-\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [346, 325, 415, 934], \\'text\\': \\'Lentil Soup quick and easy meal, perfect for busy weekdays.\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [186, 10, 324, 987]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [895, 819, 957, 967]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 822, 40, 895]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 194, 38, 241]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [13, 43, 41, 191]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 171, 100, 358]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[380,614],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Broccoli\\' app icon, which is located at approximately [380, 614], to open the app. The \\'Broccoli\\' app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. This action is expected to launch the Broccoli app. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Broccoli\\' app icon successfully opened the Broccoli app. The screen changed from the app drawer to the main interface of the Broccoli app, which is titled \\'Recipes\\' and lists several recipes. This action directly contributed to completing Subgoal 1, as the app is now open. The agent is closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[521,616],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe entry, which is located around [521, 616]. This action is performed to check if a contextual menu with a \\'Delete\\' option appears, as part of determining the recipe deletion method. Actual Outcome: The long press on the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe entry at [521, 616] did not reveal a contextual delete menu. Instead, it opened the details page for this recipe. The screen changed from the recipe list to the specific recipe\\'s details. This action clarified that long-pressing from the list view is not the deletion method and has moved the agent to the recipe details page, which is the next step in exploring deletion methods. The agent is closer to identifying how to delete recipes.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approximate center [84, 943]). This icon is currently visible on the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe details page. This action is taken to check if a \\'Delete\\' option is available within this menu, as part of identifying the recipe deletion method. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dot menu icon (coordinates [84, 943]) was successful. It opened a context menu with four options: \"Share\", \"Share as file\", \"Edit\", and \"Delete\". This action brought the agent closer to completing the overall user instruction by identifying the method to delete recipes. The \"Delete\" option is now visible and can be interacted with in the next step.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[252,585],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Delete\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Delete\\' option is currently visible as the last item in the menu that appeared after tapping the three-dot icon. This action is expected to initiate the deletion of the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe, possibly by showing a confirmation dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Delete\\' option (located around [252, 585] in the previous screen) was successful. It triggered a confirmation pop-up dialog with the message \\'Delete this recipe?\\' and two options: \\'CANCEL\\' and \\'DELETE\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to deleting the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe, as the next step is to confirm this deletion.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[540,799],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'DELETE\\' button in the confirmation dialog. The \\'DELETE\\' button is currently visible on the screen. This action is expected to confirm the deletion of the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe and return to the previous screen, likely the recipe list. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'DELETE\\' button (coordinates [540, 799] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe was deleted, and the app returned to the \\'All recipes\\' list. The recipe is no longer visible, confirming the deletion. This action completed the active subgoal of deleting \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 7: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[240,616],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe entry, which is located around [240, 616]. This action is expected to open the details page for the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe, which is the first step in the deletion process.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[521,616],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe entry, which is located around [521, 616]. This action is performed to check if a contextual menu with a \\'Delete\\' option appears, as part of determining the recipe deletion method. Actual Outcome: The long press on the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe entry at [521, 616] did not reveal a contextual delete menu. Instead, it opened the details page for this recipe. The screen changed from the recipe list to the specific recipe\\'s details. This action clarified that long-pressing from the list view is not the deletion method and has moved the agent to the recipe details page, which is the next step in exploring deletion methods. The agent is closer to identifying how to delete recipes.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approximate center [84, 943]). This icon is currently visible on the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe details page. This action is taken to check if a \\'Delete\\' option is available within this menu, as part of identifying the recipe deletion method. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dot menu icon (coordinates [84, 943]) was successful. It opened a context menu with four options: \"Share\", \"Share as file\", \"Edit\", and \"Delete\". This action brought the agent closer to completing the overall user instruction by identifying the method to delete recipes. The \"Delete\" option is now visible and can be interacted with in the next step.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[252,585],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Delete\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Delete\\' option is currently visible as the last item in the menu that appeared after tapping the three-dot icon. This action is expected to initiate the deletion of the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe, possibly by showing a confirmation dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Delete\\' option (located around [252, 585] in the previous screen) was successful. It triggered a confirmation pop-up dialog with the message \\'Delete this recipe?\\' and two options: \\'CANCEL\\' and \\'DELETE\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to deleting the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe, as the next step is to confirm this deletion.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[540,799],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'DELETE\\' button in the confirmation dialog. The \\'DELETE\\' button is currently visible on the screen. This action is expected to confirm the deletion of the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe and return to the previous screen, likely the recipe list. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'DELETE\\' button (coordinates [540, 799] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe was deleted, and the app returned to the \\'All recipes\\' list. The recipe is no longer visible, confirming the deletion. This action completed the active subgoal of deleting \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[240,616],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe entry, which is located around [240, 616]. This action is expected to open the details page for the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe, which is the first step in the deletion process. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe entry (coordinates [240, 616] in the previous screen) was successful. The app transitioned from the \\'All recipes\\' list to the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' details page. This action brings the agent closer to deleting the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe, as the recipe details page is now open, and the next step is to access the delete option via the three-dot menu.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.40\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'[Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [70, 180, 100, 626], \\'text\\': \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [135, 36, 167, 527], \\'text\\': \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [187, 108, 200, 129], \\'text\\': \\'2\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [182, 129, 206, 272], \\'text\\': \\'servings\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [184, 457, 202, 538], \\'text\\': \\'3 hrs\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [225, 65, 246, 855], \\'text\\': \\'delicious and healthy choice for any.time of the day.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [268, 32, 318, 294], \\'text\\': \\'Ingredients various amounts\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [342, 36, 363, 240], \\'text\\': \\'Directions\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [375, 88, 430, 881], \\'text\\': \\'Saute shrimp in butter and minced garlic until pink. Sprinkle with parsley and serve with lemon wedges. Garnish with fresh herbs for a more vibrant taste.\\'}\", \\'{\\\\\\'box_2d\\\\\\': [912, 863, 939, 925], \\\\\\'text\\\\\\': \\\\\\'\"9\\\\\\'}\\']\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [895, 818, 957, 968]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 902, 101, 984]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [174, 374, 213, 557]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 801, 106, 890]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 179, 99, 623]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [13, 820, 40, 896]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 193, 40, 242]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [52, 853, 67, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 904, 39, 946]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[521,616],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe entry, which is located around [521, 616]. This action is performed to check if a contextual menu with a \\'Delete\\' option appears, as part of determining the recipe deletion method. Actual Outcome: The long press on the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe entry at [521, 616] did not reveal a contextual delete menu. Instead, it opened the details page for this recipe. The screen changed from the recipe list to the specific recipe\\'s details. This action clarified that long-pressing from the list view is not the deletion method and has moved the agent to the recipe details page, which is the next step in exploring deletion methods. The agent is closer to identifying how to delete recipes.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approximate center [84, 943]). This icon is currently visible on the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe details page. This action is taken to check if a \\'Delete\\' option is available within this menu, as part of identifying the recipe deletion method. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dot menu icon (coordinates [84, 943]) was successful. It opened a context menu with four options: \"Share\", \"Share as file\", \"Edit\", and \"Delete\". This action brought the agent closer to completing the overall user instruction by identifying the method to delete recipes. The \"Delete\" option is now visible and can be interacted with in the next step.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[252,585],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Delete\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Delete\\' option is currently visible as the last item in the menu that appeared after tapping the three-dot icon. This action is expected to initiate the deletion of the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe, possibly by showing a confirmation dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Delete\\' option (located around [252, 585] in the previous screen) was successful. It triggered a confirmation pop-up dialog with the message \\'Delete this recipe?\\' and two options: \\'CANCEL\\' and \\'DELETE\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to deleting the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe, as the next step is to confirm this deletion.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[540,799],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'DELETE\\' button in the confirmation dialog. The \\'DELETE\\' button is currently visible on the screen. This action is expected to confirm the deletion of the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe and return to the previous screen, likely the recipe list. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'DELETE\\' button (coordinates [540, 799] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe was deleted, and the app returned to the \\'All recipes\\' list. The recipe is no longer visible, confirming the deletion. This action completed the active subgoal of deleting \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[240,616],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe entry, which is located around [240, 616]. This action is expected to open the details page for the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe, which is the first step in the deletion process. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe entry (coordinates [240, 616] in the previous screen) was successful. The app transitioned from the \\'All recipes\\' list to the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' details page. This action brings the agent closer to deleting the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe, as the recipe details page is now open, and the next step is to access the delete option via the three-dot menu.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 8: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon, located at the top right of the screen (approximate center [84, 943]). This icon is currently visible on the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe details page. This action is expected to open a context menu containing a \\'Delete\\' option.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approximate center [84, 943]). This icon is currently visible on the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe details page. This action is taken to check if a \\'Delete\\' option is available within this menu, as part of identifying the recipe deletion method. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dot menu icon (coordinates [84, 943]) was successful. It opened a context menu with four options: \"Share\", \"Share as file\", \"Edit\", and \"Delete\". This action brought the agent closer to completing the overall user instruction by identifying the method to delete recipes. The \"Delete\" option is now visible and can be interacted with in the next step.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[252,585],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Delete\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Delete\\' option is currently visible as the last item in the menu that appeared after tapping the three-dot icon. This action is expected to initiate the deletion of the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe, possibly by showing a confirmation dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Delete\\' option (located around [252, 585] in the previous screen) was successful. It triggered a confirmation pop-up dialog with the message \\'Delete this recipe?\\' and two options: \\'CANCEL\\' and \\'DELETE\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to deleting the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe, as the next step is to confirm this deletion.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[540,799],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'DELETE\\' button in the confirmation dialog. The \\'DELETE\\' button is currently visible on the screen. This action is expected to confirm the deletion of the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe and return to the previous screen, likely the recipe list. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'DELETE\\' button (coordinates [540, 799] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe was deleted, and the app returned to the \\'All recipes\\' list. The recipe is no longer visible, confirming the deletion. This action completed the active subgoal of deleting \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[240,616],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe entry, which is located around [240, 616]. This action is expected to open the details page for the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe, which is the first step in the deletion process. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe entry (coordinates [240, 616] in the previous screen) was successful. The app transitioned from the \\'All recipes\\' list to the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' details page. This action brings the agent closer to deleting the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe, as the recipe details page is now open, and the next step is to access the delete option via the three-dot menu.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon, located at the top right of the screen (approximate center [84, 943]). This icon is currently visible on the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe details page. This action is expected to open a context menu containing a \\'Delete\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dot menu icon (coordinates [84, 943]) was successful. It opened a context menu with four options: \\'Share\\', \\'Share as file\\', \\'Edit\\', and \\'Delete\\'. This action brought the agent closer to deleting the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe, as the \\'Delete\\' option is now visible and can be interacted with in the next step.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 42, 35, 132], \\'text\\': \\'15.41\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'[Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \\'{\\\\\\'box_2d\\\\\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\\\\\'text\\\\\\': \"\\\\\\'Yv: 0.0\"}\\', \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 710, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'IPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 65, 948], \\'text\\': \\'ISize: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 182, 102, 656], \\'text\\': \\'Garlic Butter Sh Share\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [135, 36, 167, 771], \\'text\\': \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp Share as file\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [187, 108, 200, 129], \\'text\\': \\'2\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [182, 129, 206, 272], \\'text\\': \\'servings\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [186, 457, 207, 626], \\'text\\': \\'3 hr Edit\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [225, 65, 260, 668], \\'text\\': \\'delicious and healthy choice Delete\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [268, 32, 318, 294], \\'text\\': \\'Ingredients various amounts\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [342, 36, 363, 240], \\'text\\': \\'Directions\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [375, 88, 430, 881], \\'text\\': \\'Saute shrimp in butter and minced garlic until pink. Sprinkle with parsley and serve with lemon wedges. Garnish with fresh herbs for a more vibrant taste.\\'}\", \\'{\\\\\\'box_2d\\\\\\': [912, 863, 939, 925], \\\\\\'text\\\\\\': \\\\\\'\"9\\\\\\'}\\']\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [895, 818, 957, 968]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [120, 518, 174, 995]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [179, 378, 212, 454]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 514, 120, 994]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 820, 37, 897]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 194, 38, 242]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 138, 37, 190]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 903, 37, 945]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [174, 519, 225, 995]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approximate center [84, 943]). This icon is currently visible on the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe details page. This action is taken to check if a \\'Delete\\' option is available within this menu, as part of identifying the recipe deletion method. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dot menu icon (coordinates [84, 943]) was successful. It opened a context menu with four options: \"Share\", \"Share as file\", \"Edit\", and \"Delete\". This action brought the agent closer to completing the overall user instruction by identifying the method to delete recipes. The \"Delete\" option is now visible and can be interacted with in the next step.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[252,585],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Delete\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Delete\\' option is currently visible as the last item in the menu that appeared after tapping the three-dot icon. This action is expected to initiate the deletion of the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe, possibly by showing a confirmation dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Delete\\' option (located around [252, 585] in the previous screen) was successful. It triggered a confirmation pop-up dialog with the message \\'Delete this recipe?\\' and two options: \\'CANCEL\\' and \\'DELETE\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to deleting the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe, as the next step is to confirm this deletion.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[540,799],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'DELETE\\' button in the confirmation dialog. The \\'DELETE\\' button is currently visible on the screen. This action is expected to confirm the deletion of the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe and return to the previous screen, likely the recipe list. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'DELETE\\' button (coordinates [540, 799] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe was deleted, and the app returned to the \\'All recipes\\' list. The recipe is no longer visible, confirming the deletion. This action completed the active subgoal of deleting \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[240,616],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe entry, which is located around [240, 616]. This action is expected to open the details page for the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe, which is the first step in the deletion process. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe entry (coordinates [240, 616] in the previous screen) was successful. The app transitioned from the \\'All recipes\\' list to the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' details page. This action brings the agent closer to deleting the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe, as the recipe details page is now open, and the next step is to access the delete option via the three-dot menu.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon, located at the top right of the screen (approximate center [84, 943]). This icon is currently visible on the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe details page. This action is expected to open a context menu containing a \\'Delete\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dot menu icon (coordinates [84, 943]) was successful. It opened a context menu with four options: \\'Share\\', \\'Share as file\\', \\'Edit\\', and \\'Delete\\'.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The \\'Delete\\' option is currently visible as the last item in the menu that appeared after tapping the three-dot icon. This action is expected to initiate the deletion of the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe, possibly by showing a confirmation dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Delete\\' option (located around [252, 585] in the previous screen) was successful. It triggered a confirmation pop-up dialog with the message \\'Delete this recipe?\\' and two options: \\'CANCEL\\' and \\'DELETE\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to deleting the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe, as the next step is to confirm this deletion.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[540,799],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'DELETE\\' button in the confirmation dialog. The \\'DELETE\\' button is currently visible on the screen. This action is expected to confirm the deletion of the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe and return to the previous screen, likely the recipe list. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'DELETE\\' button (coordinates [540, 799] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe was deleted, and the app returned to the \\'All recipes\\' list. The recipe is no longer visible, confirming the deletion. This action completed the active subgoal of deleting \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[240,616],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe entry, which is located around [240, 616]. This action is expected to open the details page for the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe, which is the first step in the deletion process. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe entry (coordinates [240, 616] in the previous screen) was successful. The app transitioned from the \\'All recipes\\' list to the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' details page. This action brings the agent closer to deleting the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe, as the recipe details page is now open, and the next step is to access the delete option via the three-dot menu.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon, located at the top right of the screen (approximate center [84, 943]). This icon is currently visible on the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe details page. This action is expected to open a context menu containing a \\'Delete\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dot menu icon (coordinates [84, 943]) was successful. It opened a context menu with four options: \\'Share\\', \\'Share as file\\', \\'Edit\\', and \\'Delete\\'. This action brought the agent closer to deleting the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe, as the \\'Delete\\' option is now visible and can be interacted with in the next step.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[242,585],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Delete\\' option in the context menu.

This action has brought the agent closer to deleting the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe, as the next step is to confirm this deletion.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 42, 35, 132], \\'text\\': \\'15.41\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 181, 99, 625], \\'text\\': \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [135, 36, 167, 527], \\'text\\': \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [187, 108, 200, 129], \\'text\\': \\'2\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [183, 130, 205, 271], \\'text\\': \\'servings\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [185, 457, 202, 537], \\'text\\': \\'3 hrs\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [225, 65, 246, 856], \\'text\\': \\'delicious and healthy choice for any time of the day:\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [269, 33, 296, 263], \\'text\\': \\'Ingredients\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [303, 37, 318, 294], \\'text\\': \\'various amounts\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [342, 36, 363, 240], \\'text\\': \\'Directions\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [376, 88, 431, 880], \\'text\\': \\'Saute shrimp in butter and minced garlic until pink.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The \\'DELETE\\' button is currently visible on the screen. This action is expected to confirm the deletion of the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe and return to the previous screen, likely the recipe list. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'DELETE\\' button (coordinates [540, 799] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe was deleted, and the app returned to the \\'All recipes\\' list. The recipe is no longer visible, confirming the deletion. This action completed the active subgoal of deleting \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[240,616],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe entry, which is located around [240, 616]. This action is expected to open the details page for the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe, which is the first step in the deletion process. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe entry (coordinates [240, 616] in the previous screen) was successful. The app transitioned from the \\'All recipes\\' list to the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' details page. This action brings the agent closer to deleting the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe, as the recipe details page is now open, and the next step is to access the delete option via the three-dot menu.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon, located at the top right of the screen (approximate center [84, 943]). This icon is currently visible on the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe details page. This action is expected to open a context menu containing a \\'Delete\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dot menu icon (coordinates [84, 943]) was successful. It opened a context menu with four options: \\'Share\\', \\'Share as file\\', \\'Edit\\', and \\'Delete\\'. This action brought the agent closer to deleting the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe, as the \\'Delete\\' option is now visible and can be interacted with in the next step.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[242,585],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Delete\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Delete\\' option is currently visible as the last item in the menu that appeared after tapping the three-dot icon. This action is expected to initiate the deletion of the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe, possibly by showing a confirmation dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Delete\\' option (coordinates [242, 585] in the previous screen) was successful. It triggered a confirmation pop-up dialog with the message \\'Delete this recipe?\\' and two options: \\'CANCEL\\' and \\'DELETE\\'.

The \\'DELETE\\' button is currently visible on the screen. This action is expected to confirm the deletion of the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe and return to the previous screen, likely the recipe list. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'DELETE\\' button (coordinates [540, 799] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe was deleted, and the app returned to the \\'All recipes\\' list. The recipe \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' is no longer visible in the list, confirming its deletion. This action completed the active subgoal of deleting \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 42, 35, 132], \\'text\\': \\'15.41\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'[Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 169, 101, 361], \\'text\\': \\'Recipes\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [135, 38, 162, 278], \\'text\\': \\'All recipes\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [206, 325, 275, 934], \\'text\\': \\'Lentil Soup quick and easy meal, perfect for busy weekdays.\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [895, 819, 957, 967]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [187, 17, 322, 991]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 195, 38, 241]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [13, 823, 41, 894]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 44, 39, 189]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 171, 100, 358]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The \\'DELETE\\' button is currently visible on the screen. This action is expected to confirm the deletion of the \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe and return to the previous screen, likely the recipe list. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'DELETE\\' button (coordinates [540, 799] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' recipe was deleted, and the app returned to the \\'All recipes\\' list. The recipe is no longer visible, confirming the deletion. This action completed the active subgoal of deleting \\'Zucchini Noodles with Pesto\\' and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[240,616],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe entry, which is located around [240, 616]. This action is expected to open the details page for the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe, which is the first step in the deletion process. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe entry (coordinates [240, 616] in the previous screen) was successful. The app transitioned from the \\'All recipes\\' list to the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' details page. This action brings the agent closer to deleting the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe, as the recipe details page is now open, and the next step is to access the delete option via the three-dot menu.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon, located at the top right of the screen (approximate center [84, 943]). This icon is currently visible on the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe details page. This action is expected to open a context menu containing a \\'Delete\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dot menu icon (coordinates [84, 943]) was successful. It opened a context menu with four options: \\'Share\\', \\'Share as file\\', \\'Edit\\', and \\'Delete\\'. This action brought the agent closer to deleting the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe, as the \\'Delete\\' option is now visible and can be interacted with in the next step.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[242,585],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Delete\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Delete\\' option is currently visible as the last item in the menu that appeared after tapping the three-dot icon. This action is expected to initiate the deletion of the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe, possibly by showing a confirmation dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Delete\\' option (coordinates [242, 585] in the previous screen) was successful. It triggered a confirmation pop-up dialog with the message \\'Delete this recipe?\\' and two options: \\'CANCEL\\' and \\'DELETE\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to deleting the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe, as the next step is to confirm this deletion.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[240,616],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe entry, which is located around [240, 616]. This action is expected to open the details page for the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe, which is the first step in the deletion process. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe entry (coordinates [240, 616] in the previous screen) was successful. The app transitioned from the \\'All recipes\\' list to the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' details page. This action brings the agent closer to deleting the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe, as the recipe details page is now open, and the next step is to access the delete option via the three-dot menu.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon, located at the top right of the screen (approximate center [84, 943]). This icon is currently visible on the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe details page. This action is expected to open a context menu containing a \\'Delete\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dot menu icon (coordinates [84, 943]) was successful. It opened a context menu with four options: \\'Share\\', \\'Share as file\\', \\'Edit\\', and \\'Delete\\'. This action brought the agent closer to deleting the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe, as the \\'Delete\\' option is now visible and can be interacted with in the next step.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[242,585],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Delete\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Delete\\' option is currently visible as the last item in the menu that appeared after tapping the three-dot icon. This action is expected to initiate the deletion of the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe, possibly by showing a confirmation dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Delete\\' option (coordinates [242, 585] in the previous screen) was successful. It triggered a confirmation pop-up dialog with the message \\'Delete this recipe?\\' and two options: \\'CANCEL\\' and \\'DELETE\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to deleting the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe, as the next step is to confirm this deletion.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[540,799],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'DELETE\\' button in the confirmation dialog. The \\'DELETE\\' button is currently visible on the screen. This action is expected to confirm the deletion of the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe and return to the previous screen, likely the recipe list. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'DELETE\\' button (coordinates [540, 799] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe was deleted, and the app returned to the \\'All recipes\\' list. The recipe \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' is no longer visible in the list, confirming its deletion. This action completed the active subgoal of deleting \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[254,504],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Lentil Soup\\' recipe entry, which is visible on the screen within the bounding box [187, 17, 322, 991]. This action is expected to open the details page for the \\'Lentil Soup\\' recipe. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Lentil Soup\\' recipe entry (coordinates [254, 504] in the previous screen) was successful. The app transitioned from the \\'All recipes\\' list to the \\'Lentil Soup\\' details page. This action brings the agent closer to deleting the \\'Lentil Soup\\' recipe, as the recipe details page is now open, and the next step is to access the delete option via the three-dot menu.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 42, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.42\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'[Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 180, 100, 435], \\'text\\': \\'Lentil Soup\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [136, 36, 168, 312], \\'text\\': \\'Lentil Soup\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [185, 106, 205, 300], \\'text\\': \\'3-4 servings\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [186, 485, 201, 567], \\'text\\': \\'3 hrs\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [224, 63, 246, 805], \\'text\\': \\'quick and easy meal, perfect for busy weekdays.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [268, 32, 318, 265], \\'text\\': \\'Ingredients see directions\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [341, 36, 363, 240], \\'text\\': \\'Directions\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [375, 88, 448, 890], \\'text\\': \\'Cook onions; carrots; celery; garlic; and lentils in vegetable broth until lentils are tender. Season with thyme and bay leaves. Garnish with fresh herbs for a more vibrant taste.\\'}\", \\'{\\\\\\'box_2d\\\\\\': [912, 863, 939, 925], \\\\\\'text\\\\\\': \\\\\\'\"9\\\\\\'}\\']\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [895, 818, 957, 968]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 901, 102, 985]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [173, 402, 214, 582]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 800, 106, 892]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [13, 820, 39, 896]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [70, 181, 99, 431]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 193, 41, 242]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [11, 43, 44, 195]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 902, 39, 945]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [52, 851, 67, 1000]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[240,616],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe entry, which is located around [240, 616]. This action is expected to open the details page for the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe, which is the first step in the deletion process. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe entry (coordinates [240, 616] in the previous screen) was successful. The app transitioned from the \\'All recipes\\' list to the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' details page. This action brings the agent closer to deleting the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe, as the recipe details page is now open, and the next step is to access the delete option via the three-dot menu.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon, located at the top right of the screen (approximate center [84, 943]). This icon is currently visible on the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe details page. This action is expected to open a context menu containing a \\'Delete\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dot menu icon (coordinates [84, 943]) was successful. It opened a context menu with four options: \\'Share\\', \\'Share as file\\', \\'Edit\\', and \\'Delete\\'. This action brought the agent closer to deleting the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe, as the \\'Delete\\' option is now visible and can be interacted with in the next step.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[242,585],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Delete\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Delete\\' option is currently visible as the last item in the menu that appeared after tapping the three-dot icon. This action is expected to initiate the deletion of the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe, possibly by showing a confirmation dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Delete\\' option (coordinates [242, 585] in the previous screen) was successful. It triggered a confirmation pop-up dialog with the message \\'Delete this recipe?\\' and two options: \\'CANCEL\\' and \\'DELETE\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to deleting the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe, as the next step is to confirm this deletion.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[540,799],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'DELETE\\' button in the confirmation dialog. The \\'DELETE\\' button is currently visible on the screen. This action is expected to confirm the deletion of the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe and return to the previous screen, likely the recipe list. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'DELETE\\' button (coordinates [540, 799] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe was deleted, and the app returned to the \\'All recipes\\' list. The recipe \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' is no longer visible in the list, confirming its deletion. This action completed the active subgoal of deleting \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[254,504],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Lentil Soup\\' recipe entry, which is visible on the screen within the bounding box [187, 17, 322, 991]. This action is expected to open the details page for the \\'Lentil Soup\\' recipe. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Lentil Soup\\' recipe entry (coordinates [254, 504] in the previous screen) was successful. The app transitioned from the \\'All recipes\\' list to the \\'Lentil Soup\\' details page. This action brings the agent closer to deleting the \\'Lentil Soup\\' recipe, as the recipe details page is now open, and the next step is to access the delete option via the three-dot menu.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 12: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This icon is currently visible on the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe details page. This action is expected to open a context menu containing a \\'Delete\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dot menu icon (coordinates [84, 943]) was successful. It opened a context menu with four options: \\'Share\\', \\'Share as file\\', \\'Edit\\', and \\'Delete\\'. This action brought the agent closer to deleting the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe, as the \\'Delete\\' option is now visible and can be interacted with in the next step.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[242,585],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Delete\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Delete\\' option is currently visible as the last item in the menu that appeared after tapping the three-dot icon. This action is expected to initiate the deletion of the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe, possibly by showing a confirmation dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Delete\\' option (coordinates [242, 585] in the previous screen) was successful. It triggered a confirmation pop-up dialog with the message \\'Delete this recipe?\\' and two options: \\'CANCEL\\' and \\'DELETE\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to deleting the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe, as the next step is to confirm this deletion.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[540,799],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'DELETE\\' button in the confirmation dialog. The \\'DELETE\\' button is currently visible on the screen. This action is expected to confirm the deletion of the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe and return to the previous screen, likely the recipe list. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'DELETE\\' button (coordinates [540, 799] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe was deleted, and the app returned to the \\'All recipes\\' list. The recipe \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' is no longer visible in the list, confirming its deletion. This action completed the active subgoal of deleting \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[254,504],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Lentil Soup\\' recipe entry, which is visible on the screen within the bounding box [187, 17, 322, 991]. This action is expected to open the details page for the \\'Lentil Soup\\' recipe. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Lentil Soup\\' recipe entry (coordinates [254, 504] in the previous screen) was successful. The app transitioned from the \\'All recipes\\' list to the \\'Lentil Soup\\' details page. This action brings the agent closer to deleting the \\'Lentil Soup\\' recipe, as the recipe details page is now open, and the next step is to access the delete option via the three-dot menu.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon, located at the top right of the screen (approximate center [84, 943]). This icon is currently visible on the \\'Lentil Soup\\' recipe details page. This action is expected to open a context menu containing a \\'Delete\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dot menu icon (coordinates [84, 943] in the previous screen) was successful.

This action brought the agent closer to deleting the \\'Lentil Soup\\' recipe, as the \\'Delete\\' option is now visible and can be interacted with in the next step.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.43\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'[Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \\'{\\\\\\'box_2d\\\\\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\\\\\'text\\\\\\': \"\\\\\\'Yv: 0.0\"}\\', \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 710, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'IPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 65, 948], \\'text\\': \\'ISize: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 180, 100, 435], \\'text\\': \\'Lentil Soup\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [84, 547, 104, 659], \\'text\\': \\'Share\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [136, 36, 168, 312], \\'text\\': \\'Lentil Soup\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [138, 550, 155, 771], \\'text\\': \\'Share as file\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [185, 106, 205, 300], \\'text\\': \\'3-4 servings\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [187, 486, 200, 507], \\'text\\': \\'3\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [190, 551, 207, 626], \\'text\\': \\'Edit\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [224, 63, 261, 669], \\'text\\': \\'quick and easy meal, perfect Delete\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [268, 32, 318, 265], \\'text\\': \\'Ingredients see directions\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [341, 36, 363, 240], \\'text\\': \\'Directions\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [375, 88, 448, 890], \\'text\\': \\'Cook onions; carrots; celery; garlic; and lentils in vegetable broth until lentils are tender. Season with thyme and bay leaves. Garnish with fresh herbs for a more vibrant taste.\\'}\", \\'{\\\\\\'box_2d\\\\\\': [912, 863, 939, 925], \\\\\\'text\\\\\\': \\\\\\'\"9\\\\\\'}\\']\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [895, 818, 957, 968]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [120, 512, 175, 996]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 512, 120, 995]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 820, 35, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [173, 512, 226, 996]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 193, 39, 242]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 905, 36, 943]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [176, 406, 213, 483]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This icon is currently visible on the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe details page. This action is expected to open a context menu containing a \\'Delete\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dot menu icon (coordinates [84, 943]) was successful. It opened a context menu with four options: \\'Share\\', \\'Share as file\\', \\'Edit\\', and \\'Delete\\'. This action brought the agent closer to deleting the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe, as the \\'Delete\\' option is now visible and can be interacted with in the next step.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[242,585],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Delete\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Delete\\' option is currently visible as the last item in the menu that appeared after tapping the three-dot icon. This action is expected to initiate the deletion of the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe, possibly by showing a confirmation dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Delete\\' option (coordinates [242, 585] in the previous screen) was successful. It triggered a confirmation pop-up dialog with the message \\'Delete this recipe?\\' and two options: \\'CANCEL\\' and \\'DELETE\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to deleting the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe, as the next step is to confirm this deletion.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

The \\'DELETE\\' button is currently visible on the screen. This action is expected to confirm the deletion of the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe and return to the previous screen, likely the recipe list. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'DELETE\\' button (coordinates [540, 799] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe was deleted, and the app returned to the \\'All recipes\\' list. The recipe \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' is no longer visible in the list, confirming its deletion.

This action is expected to open the details page for the \\'Lentil Soup\\' recipe. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Lentil Soup\\' recipe entry (coordinates [254, 504] in the previous screen) was successful. The app transitioned from the \\'All recipes\\' list to the \\'Lentil Soup\\' details page. This action brings the agent closer to deleting the \\'Lentil Soup\\' recipe, as the recipe details page is now open, and the next step is to access the delete option via the three-dot menu.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The \\'Delete\\' option is currently visible as the last item in the menu that appeared after tapping the three-dot icon. This action is expected to initiate the deletion of the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe, possibly by showing a confirmation dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Delete\\' option (coordinates [242, 585] in the previous screen) was successful. It triggered a confirmation pop-up dialog with the message \\'Delete this recipe?\\' and two options: \\'CANCEL\\' and \\'DELETE\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to deleting the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe, as the next step is to confirm this deletion.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

The \\'DELETE\\' button is currently visible on the screen. This action is expected to confirm the deletion of the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe and return to the previous screen, likely the recipe list. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'DELETE\\' button (coordinates [540, 799] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe was deleted, and the app returned to the \\'All recipes\\' list. The recipe \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' is no longer visible in the list, confirming its deletion. This action completed the active subgoal of deleting \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[254,504],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Lentil Soup\\' recipe entry, which is visible on the screen within the bounding box [187, 17, 322, 991]. This action is expected to open the details page for the \\'Lentil Soup\\' recipe. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Lentil Soup\\' recipe entry (coordinates [254, 504] in the previous screen) was successful. The app transitioned from the \\'All recipes\\' list to the \\'Lentil Soup\\' details page. This action brings the agent closer to deleting the \\'Lentil Soup\\' recipe, as the recipe details page is now open, and the next step is to access the delete option via the three-dot menu.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon, located at the top right of the screen (approximate center [84, 943]). This icon is currently visible on the \\'Lentil Soup\\' recipe details page. This action is expected to open a context menu containing a \\'Delete\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dot menu icon (coordinates [84, 943] in the previous screen) was successful. It opened a context menu with four options: \\'Share\\', \\'Share as file\\', \\'Edit\\', and \\'Delete\\'. This action brought the agent closer to deleting the \\'Lentil Soup\\' recipe, as the \\'Delete\\' option is now visible and can be interacted with in the next step.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Delete\\' option (coordinates [242, 610] in the previous screen) was successful. It triggered a confirmation pop-up dialog with the message \\'Delete this recipe?\\' and two options: \\'CANCEL\\' and \\'DELETE\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to deleting the \\'Lentil Soup\\' recipe, as the next step is to confirm this deletion.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 42, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.43\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 180, 100, 435], \\'text\\': \\'Lentil Soup\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [136, 36, 168, 312], \\'text\\': \\'Lentil Soup\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [187, 107, 201, 162], \\'text\\': \\'3-4\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [183, 160, 205, 300], \\'text\\': \\'servings\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [186, 485, 201, 567], \\'text\\': \\'3 hrs\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [224, 65, 246, 806], \\'text\\': \\'quick and easy meal, perfect for busy weekdays.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [267, 32, 318, 265], \\'text\\': \\'Ingredients see directions\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [342, 36, 363, 240], \\'text\\': \\'Directions\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [376, 88, 448, 890], \\'text\\': \\'Cook onions, carrots; celery; garlic; and lentils in vegetable broth until lentils are tender. Season with  thyme and bay leaves. Garnish with fresh herbs for a more vibrant taste\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [471, 119, 493, 444], \\'text\\': \\'Delete this recipe?\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [533, 501, 548, 652], \\'text\\': \\'CANCEL\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [533, 727, 548, 871], \\'text\\': \\'DELETE\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [895, 819, 957, 966]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 901, 101, 987]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 821, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 194, 39, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 800, 107, 894]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 904, 37, 944]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 412, 215, 485]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 64, 38, 190]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [985, 363, 1000, 633]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [70, 182, 99, 430]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[242,585],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Delete\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Delete\\' option is currently visible as the last item in the menu that appeared after tapping the three-dot icon. This action is expected to initiate the deletion of the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe, possibly by showing a confirmation dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Delete\\' option (coordinates [242, 585] in the previous screen) was successful. It triggered a confirmation pop-up dialog with the message \\'Delete this recipe?\\' and two options: \\'CANCEL\\' and \\'DELETE\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to deleting the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe, as the next step is to confirm this deletion.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

The \\'DELETE\\' button is currently visible on the screen. This action is expected to confirm the deletion of the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe and return to the previous screen, likely the recipe list. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'DELETE\\' button (coordinates [540, 799] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe was deleted, and the app returned to the \\'All recipes\\' list. The recipe \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' is no longer visible in the list, confirming its deletion. This action completed the active subgoal of deleting \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Lentil Soup\\' recipe entry (coordinates [254, 504] in the previous screen) was successful. The app transitioned from the \\'All recipes\\' list to the \\'Lentil Soup\\' details page. This action brings the agent closer to deleting the \\'Lentil Soup\\' recipe, as the recipe details page is now open, and the next step is to access the delete option via the three-dot menu.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

This icon is currently visible on the \\'Lentil Soup\\' recipe details page. This action is expected to open a context menu containing a \\'Delete\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dot menu icon (coordinates [84, 943] in the previous screen) was successful. It opened a context menu with four options: \\'Share\\', \\'Share as file\\', \\'Edit\\', and \\'Delete\\'. This action brought the agent closer to deleting the \\'Lentil Soup\\' recipe, as the \\'Delete\\' option is now visible and can be interacted with in the next step.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[242,610],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Delete\\' option in the context menu.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The \\'DELETE\\' button is currently visible on the screen. This action is expected to confirm the deletion of the \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe and return to the previous screen, likely the recipe list. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'DELETE\\' button (coordinates [540, 799] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' recipe was deleted, and the app returned to the \\'All recipes\\' list. The recipe \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' is no longer visible in the list, confirming its deletion. This action completed the active subgoal of deleting \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp\\' and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[254,504],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Lentil Soup\\' recipe entry, which is visible on the screen within the bounding box [187, 17, 322, 991]. This action is expected to open the details page for the \\'Lentil Soup\\' recipe. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Lentil Soup\\' recipe entry (coordinates [254, 504] in the previous screen) was successful. The app transitioned from the \\'All recipes\\' list to the \\'Lentil Soup\\' details page. This action brings the agent closer to deleting the \\'Lentil Soup\\' recipe, as the recipe details page is now open, and the next step is to access the delete option via the three-dot menu.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon, located at the top right of the screen (approximate center [84, 943]). This icon is currently visible on the \\'Lentil Soup\\' recipe details page. This action is expected to open a context menu containing a \\'Delete\\' option. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the three-dot menu icon (coordinates [84, 943] in the previous screen) was successful. It opened a context menu with four options: \\'Share\\', \\'Share as file\\', \\'Edit\\', and \\'Delete\\'. This action brought the agent closer to deleting the \\'Lentil Soup\\' recipe, as the \\'Delete\\' option is now visible and can be interacted with in the next step.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[242,610],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Delete\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Delete\\' option is currently visible as the last item in the menu that appeared after tapping the three-dot icon. This action is expected to initiate the deletion of the \\'Lentil Soup\\' recipe, possibly by showing a confirmation dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Delete\\' option (coordinates [242, 610] in the previous screen) was successful. It triggered a confirmation pop-up dialog with the message \\'Delete this recipe?\\' and two options: \\'CANCEL\\' and \\'DELETE\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to deleting the \\'Lentil Soup\\' recipe, as the next step is to confirm this deletion.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[540,799],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'DELETE\\' button in the confirmation dialog. The \\'DELETE\\' button is currently visible on the screen. This action is expected to confirm the deletion of the \\'Lentil Soup\\' recipe and return to the previous screen, likely the recipe list. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'DELETE\\' button (coordinates [540, 799] in the previous screen) was successful. The \\'Lentil Soup\\' recipe was deleted, and the app returned to the \\'All recipes\\' list. The screen now displays \\'No recipes found.\\', confirming the deletion of \\'Lentil Soup\\' and that it was the last remaining recipe. This action completed the active subgoal of deleting \\'Lentil Soup\\' and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 44, 35, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.44\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'[Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 169, 101, 361], \\'text\\': \\'Recipes\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [134, 38, 162, 278], \\'text\\': \\'All recipes\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [477, 119, 507, 548], \\'text\\': \\'No recipes found.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [528, 191, 613, 733], \\'text\\': \\'create a new recipe import a recipe from a website\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [895, 819, 957, 967]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [116, 887, 177, 989]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [11, 43, 43, 201]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [12, 821, 43, 894]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 171, 100, 358]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [116, 4, 177, 308]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",
