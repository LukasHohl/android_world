Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to reveal the list of all installed applications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Broccoli app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[337,614],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Broccoli app icon, which is a green circle with a white broccoli tree shape, located at approximately [337, 614]. This action is expected to open the Broccoli app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Broccoli app icon at approximately [337, 614] was successful. The \\'Broccoli\\' app launched, and its main screen, titled \\'Recipes\\', is now visible. This screen displays a list of recipes. The action successfully completed the subgoal of opening the app and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'[Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 169, 101, 361], \\'text\\': \\'Recipes\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [135, 38, 162, 278], \\'text\\': \\'All recipes\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [207, 325, 275, 911], \\'text\\': \\'Avocado Toast with Egg delicious and healthy choice for any time of the day-\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [333, 325, 430, 907], \\'text\\': \\'Baked Cod with Lemon and Dill delicious and healthy choice for any time of the day-\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [487, 325, 555, 936], \\'text\\': \\'BBQ Chicken Quesadillas delicious and healthy choice for any time of the day-\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [625, 324, 696, 934], \\'text\\': \\'Beef Stir Fry quick and easy meal, perfect for busy weekdays.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [765, 326, 835, 911], \\'text\\': \\'Butternut Squash Soup An ideal recipe for experimenting with different flavors and ingredients .\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [907, 325, 974, 847], \\'text\\': \\'Caprese Salad Skews quick and easy meal, perfect fol weekdays.\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [611, 9, 744, 989]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [746, 10, 883, 990]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [186, 11, 323, 994]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [13, 821, 42, 895]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 194, 39, 242]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [125, 897, 166, 983]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [12, 43, 43, 193]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [887, 10, 1000, 989]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 171, 100, 359]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to open the Broccoli app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Broccoli app icon at approximately [337, 614] was successful. The \\'Broccoli\\' app launched, and its main screen, titled \\'Recipes\\', is now visible. This screen displays a list of recipes. The action successfully completed the subgoal of opening the app and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 2: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the lower part of the screen (around [700, 500]) to the upper part of the screen (around [300, 500]) to scroll down the list of recipes.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to reveal the list of all installed applications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Broccoli app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[337,614],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Broccoli app icon, which is a green circle with a white broccoli tree shape, located at approximately [337, 614]. This action is expected to open the Broccoli app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Broccoli app icon at approximately [337, 614] was successful. The \\'Broccoli\\' app launched, and its main screen, titled \\'Recipes\\', is now visible. This screen displays a list of recipes. The action successfully completed the subgoal of opening the app and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the lower part of the screen (around [700, 500]) to the upper part of the screen (around [300, 500]) to scroll down the list of recipes. This action is expected to reveal more recipes in the list, hopefully including \\'Classic Margherita Pizza\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] successfully scrolled the list of recipes downwards. New recipes appeared at the bottom of the visible list, and recipes previously at the top are no longer visible. The target recipe, \"Classic Margherita Pizza,\" has not yet been found. The action was successful in terms of scrolling but did not yet lead to the completion of the active subgoal. Further scrolling is needed.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 3: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the lower part of the screen (around [700, 500]) to the upper part of the screen (around [300, 500]) to scroll down the list of recipes. This action is expected to reveal more recipes in the list, hopefully including \\'Classic Margherita Pizza\\'.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below.

This action is expected to reveal the list of all installed applications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Broccoli app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[337,614],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Broccoli app icon, which is a green circle with a white broccoli tree shape, located at approximately [337, 614]. This action is expected to open the Broccoli app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Broccoli app icon at approximately [337, 614] was successful. The \\'Broccoli\\' app launched, and its main screen, titled \\'Recipes\\', is now visible. This screen displays a list of recipes. The action successfully completed the subgoal of opening the app and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the lower part of the screen (around [700, 500]) to the upper part of the screen (around [300, 500]) to scroll down the list of recipes. This action is expected to reveal more recipes in the list, hopefully including \\'Classic Margherita Pizza\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] successfully scrolled the list of recipes downwards. New recipes appeared at the bottom of the visible list, and recipes previously at the top are no longer visible. The target recipe, \"Classic Margherita Pizza,\" has not yet been found. The action was successful in terms of scrolling but did not yet lead to the completion of the active subgoal. Further scrolling is needed.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the lower part of the screen (around [700, 500]) to the upper part of the screen (around [300, 500]) to scroll down the list of recipes. This action is expected to reveal more recipes in the list, hopefully including \\'Classic Margherita Pizza\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] successfully scrolled the list of recipes downwards. Recipes previously at the top of the list are no longer visible, and new recipes may have appeared at the bottom. However, the target recipe, \\'Classic Margherita Pizza,\\' is still not visible on the screen. The action was successful in terms of scrolling but did not yet lead to the completion of the active subgoal. Further scrolling is needed.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.36\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [54, 283, 65, 395], \\'text\\': \\'IdY:-960.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 679], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: -0.960\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 169, 101, 361], \\'text\\': \\'Recipes\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [135, 38, 162, 278], \\'text\\': \\'All recipes\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [213, 324, 282, 934], \\'text\\': \\'Beef Stir Fry quick and easy meal, perfect for busy weekdays.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [351, 326, 422, 912], \\'text\\': \\'Butternut Squash Soup An ideal recipe for experimenting with different flavors and ingredients.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [494, 324, 562, 934], \\'text\\': \\'Caprese Salad Skewers quick and easy meal, perfect for busy weekdays.\\'}\", \\'{\\\\\\'box_2d\\\\\\': [634, 324, 702, 934], \\\\\\'text\\\\\\': \\\\\\'Cauliflower Fried \"Rice\" quick and easy meal, perfect for busy weekdays.\\\\\\'}\\', \"{\\'box_2d\\': [774, 324, 842, 934], \\'text\\': \\'Chicken Alfredo Pasta quick and easy meal, perfect for busy weekdays.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [901, 326, 975, 930], \\'text\\': \\'Chicken Caesar Sala Wrap quick and easy meal perfect for busy\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [752, 10, 888, 987]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [612, 10, 752, 992]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [894, 819, 958, 974]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [471, 10, 609, 989]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [193, 10, 330, 990]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 821, 37, 896]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 194, 38, 242]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 48, 38, 189]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 906, 37, 944]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [126, 900, 166, 981]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to reveal the list of all installed applications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Broccoli app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[337,614],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Broccoli app icon, which is a green circle with a white broccoli tree shape, located at approximately [337, 614]. This action is expected to open the Broccoli app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Broccoli app icon at approximately [337, 614] was successful. The \\'Broccoli\\' app launched, and its main screen, titled \\'Recipes\\', is now visible. This screen displays a list of recipes. The action successfully completed the subgoal of opening the app and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the lower part of the screen (around [700, 500]) to the upper part of the screen (around [300, 500]) to scroll down the list of recipes. This action is expected to reveal more recipes in the list, hopefully including \\'Classic Margherita Pizza\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] successfully scrolled the list of recipes downwards. New recipes appeared at the bottom of the visible list, and recipes previously at the top are no longer visible. The target recipe, \"Classic Margherita Pizza,\" has not yet been found. The action was successful in terms of scrolling but did not yet lead to the completion of the active subgoal. Further scrolling is needed.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the lower part of the screen (around [700, 500]) to the upper part of the screen (around [300, 500]) to scroll down the list of recipes. This action is expected to reveal more recipes in the list, hopefully including \\'Classic Margherita Pizza\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] successfully scrolled the list of recipes downwards. Recipes previously at the top of the list are no longer visible, and new recipes may have appeared at the bottom. However, the target recipe, \\'Classic Margherita Pizza,\\' is still not visible on the screen. The action was successful in terms of scrolling but did not yet lead to the completion of the active subgoal. Further scrolling is needed.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 4: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the lower part of the screen (around [700, 500]) to the upper part of the screen (around [300, 500]) to scroll down the list of recipes.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Further scrolling is needed.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the lower part of the screen (around [700, 500]) to the upper part of the screen (around [300, 500]) to scroll down the list of recipes. This action is expected to reveal more recipes in the list, hopefully including \\'Classic Margherita Pizza\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] successfully scrolled the list of recipes downwards. Recipes previously at the top of the list are no longer visible, and new recipes have appeared. The target recipe, \\'Classic Margherita Pizza,\\' is now visible on the screen. The action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by completing the active subgoal of finding the recipe.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.36\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [54, 283, 65, 395], \\'text\\': \\'IdY:-960.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 679], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: -0.960\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 169, 101, 361], \\'text\\': \\'Recipes\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [135, 38, 162, 278], \\'text\\': \\'All recipes\\'}\", \\'{\\\\\\'box_2d\\\\\\': [217, 325, 284, 935], \\\\\\'text\\\\\\': \\\\\\'Cauliflower Fried \"Rice\" quick and easy meal, perfect for busy weekdays.\\\\\\'}\\', \"{\\'box_2d\\': [357, 324, 425, 935], \\'text\\': \\'Chicken Alfredo Pasta quick and easy meal, perfect for busy weekdays.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [482, 324, 579, 934], \\'text\\': \\'Chicken Caesar Salad Wrap quick and easy meal, perfect for busy weekdays.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [633, 323, 704, 950], \\'text\\': \\'Chickpea Vegetable Soup An ideal recipe for experimenting with different flavors and ingredients.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [775, 325, 845, 930], \\'text\\': \\'Classic Margherita Pizza delicious and healthy choice for any time of the day.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [916, 328, 967, 914], \\'text\\': \\'Garlic Butter Shrimp quick and easy meal, perfect for Dus\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [755, 11, 891, 984]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [613, 11, 755, 991]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [473, 11, 611, 987]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [195, 12, 331, 987]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [895, 817, 962, 975]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 194, 38, 242]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 821, 38, 896]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 61, 39, 189]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [126, 899, 166, 982]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 905, 37, 945]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Broccoli app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[337,614],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Broccoli app icon, which is a green circle with a white broccoli tree shape, located at approximately [337, 614]. This action is expected to open the Broccoli app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Broccoli app icon at approximately [337, 614] was successful. The \\'Broccoli\\' app launched, and its main screen, titled \\'Recipes\\', is now visible. This screen displays a list of recipes. The action successfully completed the subgoal of opening the app and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the lower part of the screen (around [700, 500]) to the upper part of the screen (around [300, 500]) to scroll down the list of recipes.

This action is expected to reveal more recipes in the list, hopefully including \\'Classic Margherita Pizza\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] successfully scrolled the list of recipes downwards. Recipes previously at the top of the list are no longer visible, and new recipes may have appeared at the bottom. However, the target recipe, \\'Classic Margherita Pizza,\\' is still not visible on the screen. The action was successful in terms of scrolling but did not yet lead to the completion of the active subgoal.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to open the Broccoli app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Broccoli app icon at approximately [337, 614] was successful. The \\'Broccoli\\' app launched, and its main screen, titled \\'Recipes\\', is now visible. This screen displays a list of recipes. The action successfully completed the subgoal of opening the app and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the lower part of the screen (around [700, 500]) to the upper part of the screen (around [300, 500]) to scroll down the list of recipes. This action is expected to reveal more recipes in the list, hopefully including \\'Classic Margherita Pizza\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] successfully scrolled the list of recipes downwards. New recipes appeared at the bottom of the visible list, and recipes previously at the top are no longer visible. The target recipe, \"Classic Margherita Pizza,\" has not yet been found.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[337,614],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Broccoli app icon, which is a green circle with a white broccoli tree shape, located at approximately [337, 614]. This action is expected to open the Broccoli app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Broccoli app icon at approximately [337, 614] was successful. The \\'Broccoli\\' app launched, and its main screen, titled \\'Recipes\\', is now visible. This screen displays a list of recipes. The action successfully completed the subgoal of opening the app and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the lower part of the screen (around [700, 500]) to the upper part of the screen (around [300, 500]) to scroll down the list of recipes. This action is expected to reveal more recipes in the list, hopefully including \\'Classic Margherita Pizza\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] successfully scrolled the list of recipes downwards. New recipes appeared at the bottom of the visible list, and recipes previously at the top are no longer visible. The target recipe, \"Classic Margherita Pizza,\" has not yet been found. The action was successful in terms of scrolling but did not yet lead to the completion of the active subgoal. Further scrolling is needed.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the lower part of the screen (around [700, 500]) to the upper part of the screen (around [300, 500]) to scroll down the list of recipes. This action is expected to reveal more recipes in the list, hopefully including \\'Classic Margherita Pizza\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] successfully scrolled the list of recipes downwards. Recipes previously at the top of the list are no longer visible, and new recipes may have appeared at the bottom. However, the target recipe, \\'Classic Margherita Pizza,\\' is still not visible on the screen. The action was successful in terms of scrolling but did not yet lead to the completion of the active subgoal. Further scrolling is needed.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the lower part of the screen (around [700, 500]) to the upper part of the screen (around [300, 500]) to scroll down the list of recipes. This action is expected to reveal more recipes in the list, hopefully including \\'Classic Margherita Pizza\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] successfully scrolled the list of recipes downwards. Recipes previously at the top of the list are no longer visible, and new recipes have appeared. The target recipe, \\'Classic Margherita Pizza,\\' is now visible on the screen. The action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by completing the active subgoal of finding the recipe.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[810,628],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the \\'Classic Margherita Pizza\\' recipe item, which is located at approximately [810, 628]. This action is expected to reveal a context menu or a delete option for the selected recipe. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on \\'Classic Margherita Pizza\\' opened the recipe\\'s detail page. This was not the intended outcome of revealing a delete option directly from the list. The agent is now on a different screen. While the recipe is still the focus, the method to delete it needs to be re-evaluated. The current screen (recipe details) has a three-dot menu icon in the top right, which is a promising candidate for finding a delete option.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 6: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located in the top right corner of the screen, at approximately [84, 943]. This action is expected to open a menu containing options related to the recipe, hopefully including a \\'Delete\\' option.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to reveal more recipes in the list, hopefully including \\'Classic Margherita Pizza\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] successfully scrolled the list of recipes downwards. New recipes appeared at the bottom of the visible list, and recipes previously at the top are no longer visible. The target recipe, \"Classic Margherita Pizza,\" has not yet been found. The action was successful in terms of scrolling but did not yet lead to the completion of the active subgoal. Further scrolling is needed.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the lower part of the screen (around [700, 500]) to the upper part of the screen (around [300, 500]) to scroll down the list of recipes. This action is expected to reveal more recipes in the list, hopefully including \\'Classic Margherita Pizza\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] successfully scrolled the list of recipes downwards. Recipes previously at the top of the list are no longer visible, and new recipes may have appeared at the bottom. However, the target recipe, \\'Classic Margherita Pizza,\\' is still not visible on the screen. The action was successful in terms of scrolling but did not yet lead to the completion of the active subgoal. Further scrolling is needed.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the lower part of the screen (around [700, 500]) to the upper part of the screen (around [300, 500]) to scroll down the list of recipes. This action is expected to reveal more recipes in the list, hopefully including \\'Classic Margherita Pizza\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] successfully scrolled the list of recipes downwards. Recipes previously at the top of the list are no longer visible, and new recipes have appeared. The target recipe, \\'Classic Margherita Pizza,\\' is now visible on the screen. The action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by completing the active subgoal of finding the recipe.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[810,628],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the \\'Classic Margherita Pizza\\' recipe item, which is located at approximately [810, 628]. This action is expected to reveal a context menu or a delete option for the selected recipe. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on \\'Classic Margherita Pizza\\' opened the recipe\\'s detail page. This was not the intended outcome of revealing a delete option directly from the list. The agent is now on a different screen. While the recipe is still the focus, the method to delete it needs to be re-evaluated. The current screen (recipe details) has a three-dot menu icon in the top right, which is a promising candidate for finding a delete option.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located in the top right corner of the screen, at approximately [84, 943]. This action is expected to open a menu containing options related to the recipe, hopefully including a \\'Delete\\' option. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [84, 943] was successful. A context menu appeared in the top right of the screen, displaying the options: \"Share\", \"Share as file\", \"Edit\", and \"Delete\". This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of deleting the recipe, as the \"Delete\" option is now accessible.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.37\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'[Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \\'{\\\\\\'box_2d\\\\\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\\\\\'text\\\\\\': \"\\\\\\'Yv: 0.0\"}\\', \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 710, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'IPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 65, 948], \\'text\\': \\'ISize: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 180, 104, 659], \\'text\\': \\'Classic Marghe Share\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [135, 36, 167, 771], \\'text\\': \\'Classic Margherita Share as file\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [183, 107, 205, 300], \\'text\\': \\'3-4 servings\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [189, 551, 207, 626], \\'text\\': \\'Edit\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [225, 65, 260, 668], \\'text\\': \\'delicious and healthy choice Delete\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [268, 32, 318, 265], \\'text\\': \\'Ingredients n/a\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [341, 36, 363, 240], \\'text\\': \\'Directions\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [377, 88, 451, 926], \\'text\\': \\'Spread pizza dough with tomato sauce, top with slices of mozzarella cheese and fresh basil leaves. Bake until crust is golden. Feel free to substitute with ingredients you have on hand.\\'}\", \\'{\\\\\\'box_2d\\\\\\': [912, 863, 939, 925], \\\\\\'text\\\\\\': \\\\\\'\"9\\\\\\'}\\']\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [895, 818, 957, 968]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [120, 515, 174, 996]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [177, 406, 215, 482]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 512, 120, 986]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 821, 37, 899]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [173, 513, 225, 995]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 38, 242]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to reveal more recipes in the list, hopefully including \\'Classic Margherita Pizza\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] successfully scrolled the list of recipes downwards. New recipes appeared at the bottom of the visible list, and recipes previously at the top are no longer visible. The target recipe, \"Classic Margherita Pizza,\" has not yet been found. The action was successful in terms of scrolling but did not yet lead to the completion of the active subgoal. Further scrolling is needed.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the lower part of the screen (around [700, 500]) to the upper part of the screen (around [300, 500]) to scroll down the list of recipes. This action is expected to reveal more recipes in the list, hopefully including \\'Classic Margherita Pizza\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] successfully scrolled the list of recipes downwards. Recipes previously at the top of the list are no longer visible, and new recipes may have appeared at the bottom. However, the target recipe, \\'Classic Margherita Pizza,\\' is still not visible on the screen. The action was successful in terms of scrolling but did not yet lead to the completion of the active subgoal. Further scrolling is needed.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the lower part of the screen (around [700, 500]) to the upper part of the screen (around [300, 500]) to scroll down the list of recipes. This action is expected to reveal more recipes in the list, hopefully including \\'Classic Margherita Pizza\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] successfully scrolled the list of recipes downwards. Recipes previously at the top of the list are no longer visible, and new recipes have appeared. The target recipe, \\'Classic Margherita Pizza,\\' is now visible on the screen. The action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by completing the active subgoal of finding the recipe.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[810,628],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the \\'Classic Margherita Pizza\\' recipe item, which is located at approximately [810, 628]. This action is expected to reveal a context menu or a delete option for the selected recipe. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on \\'Classic Margherita Pizza\\' opened the recipe\\'s detail page. This was not the intended outcome of revealing a delete option directly from the list. The agent is now on a different screen. While the recipe is still the focus, the method to delete it needs to be re-evaluated. The current screen (recipe details) has a three-dot menu icon in the top right, which is a promising candidate for finding a delete option.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located in the top right corner of the screen, at approximately [84, 943]. This action is expected to open a menu containing options related to the recipe, hopefully including a \\'Delete\\' option. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [84, 943] was successful. A context menu appeared in the top right of the screen, displaying the options: \"Share\", \"Share as file\", \"Edit\", and \"Delete\". This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of deleting the recipe, as the \"Delete\" option is now accessible.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 7: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[243,600],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Delete\\' option in the context menu, located approximately at [243, 600]. This action is expected to initiate the deletion process for the \\'Classic Margherita Pizza\\' recipe. A confirmation dialog might appear after this action.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[810,628],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the \\'Classic Margherita Pizza\\' recipe item, which is located at approximately [810, 628]. This action is expected to reveal a context menu or a delete option for the selected recipe. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on \\'Classic Margherita Pizza\\' opened the recipe\\'s detail page. This was not the intended outcome of revealing a delete option directly from the list. The agent is now on a different screen. While the recipe is still the focus, the method to delete it needs to be re-evaluated. The current screen (recipe details) has a three-dot menu icon in the top right, which is a promising candidate for finding a delete option.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located in the top right corner of the screen, at approximately [84, 943]. This action is expected to open a menu containing options related to the recipe, hopefully including a \\'Delete\\' option. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [84, 943] was successful. A context menu appeared in the top right of the screen, displaying the options: \"Share\", \"Share as file\", \"Edit\", and \"Delete\". This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of deleting the recipe, as the \"Delete\" option is now accessible.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[243,600],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Delete\\' option in the context menu, located approximately at [243, 600]. This action is expected to initiate the deletion process for the \\'Classic Margherita Pizza\\' recipe. A confirmation dialog might appear after this action. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Delete\\' option in the context menu (located approximately at [243, 600]) was successful. A confirmation dialog appeared on the screen with the message \\'Delete this recipe?\\' and two options: \\'CANCEL\\' and \\'DELETE\\'. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to confirm the deletion.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 42, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.38\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [70, 179, 100, 724], \\'text\\': \\'Classic Margherita Pizza\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [136, 36, 166, 637], \\'text\\': \\'Classic Margherita Pizza\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [185, 106, 205, 300], \\'text\\': \\'3-4 servings\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [186, 513, 201, 567], \\'text\\': \\'hrs\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [225, 65, 246, 856], \\'text\\': \\'delicious and healthy choice for any time of the day:\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [269, 33, 297, 264], \\'text\\': \\'Ingredients\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [304, 37, 318, 93], \\'text\\': \\'n/a\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [342, 36, 363, 240], \\'text\\': \\'Directions\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [377, 88, 450, 926], \\'text\\': \\'Spread pizza dough with tomato sauce, top with slices of mozzarella cheese and fresh basil leaves.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to reveal more recipes in the list, hopefully including \\'Classic Margherita Pizza\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] successfully scrolled the list of recipes downwards. Recipes previously at the top of the list are no longer visible, and new recipes may have appeared at the bottom. However, the target recipe, \\'Classic Margherita Pizza,\\' is still not visible on the screen. The action was successful in terms of scrolling but did not yet lead to the completion of the active subgoal. Further scrolling is needed.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the lower part of the screen (around [700, 500]) to the upper part of the screen (around [300, 500]) to scroll down the list of recipes. This action is expected to reveal more recipes in the list, hopefully including \\'Classic Margherita Pizza\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 500] to [300, 500] successfully scrolled the list of recipes downwards. Recipes previously at the top of the list are no longer visible, and new recipes have appeared. The target recipe, \\'Classic Margherita Pizza,\\' is now visible on the screen. The action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by completing the active subgoal of finding the recipe.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[810,628],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the \\'Classic Margherita Pizza\\' recipe item, which is located at approximately [810, 628]. This action is expected to reveal a context menu or a delete option for the selected recipe. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on \\'Classic Margherita Pizza\\' opened the recipe\\'s detail page. This was not the intended outcome of revealing a delete option directly from the list. The agent is now on a different screen. While the recipe is still the focus, the method to delete it needs to be re-evaluated. The current screen (recipe details) has a three-dot menu icon in the top right, which is a promising candidate for finding a delete option.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located in the top right corner of the screen, at approximately [84, 943]. This action is expected to open a menu containing options related to the recipe, hopefully including a \\'Delete\\' option. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [84, 943] was successful. A context menu appeared in the top right of the screen, displaying the options: \"Share\", \"Share as file\", \"Edit\", and \"Delete\". This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of deleting the recipe, as the \"Delete\" option is now accessible.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[243,600],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Delete\\' option in the context menu, located approximately at [243, 600]. This action is expected to initiate the deletion process for the \\'Classic Margherita Pizza\\' recipe. A confirmation dialog might appear after this action. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Delete\\' option in the context menu (located approximately at [243, 600]) was successful. A confirmation dialog appeared on the screen with the message \\'Delete this recipe?\\' and two options: \\'CANCEL\\' and \\'DELETE\\'. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to confirm the deletion.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 8: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[540,799],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'DELETE\\' button in the confirmation dialog. The \\'DELETE\\' button is located at approximately [540, 799]. This action is expected to confirm the deletion of the \\'Classic Margherita Pizza\\' recipe and return to the recipe list or a confirmation message. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Broccoli App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Broccoli app is open and its main screen is visible.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",
