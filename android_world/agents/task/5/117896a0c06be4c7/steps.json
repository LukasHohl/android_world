Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 798], \\'text\\': \\'Prs: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 65, 948], \\'text\\': \\'Size: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [123, 46, 147, 306], \\'text\\': \\'Sun; Oct 15\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 336, 722, 431], \\'text\\': \\'Gmail\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 561, 722, 676], \\'text\\': \\'Photos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [704, 781, 722, 921], \\'text\\': \\'YouTube\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [775, 295, 872, 709], \\'text\\': \\'0 (9\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 72, 855, 232]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [788, 764, 856, 929]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 535, 858, 706]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 299, 856, 466]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [628, 536, 729, 695]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 764, 729, 927]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 299, 730, 463]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [900, 701, 948, 795]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [892, 801, 952, 924]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to reveal the list of installed applications, where I can then find and open the Retro Music app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Retro Music app. The Retro Music app is not visible on the current screen, so scrolling will be necessary.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution.

This is done to find the \\'Retro Music\\' app, which is not currently visible on the screen. The expected outcome is that more apps will be revealed, hopefully including \\'Retro Music\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, and the \\'Retro Music\\' app is now visible on the screen. The app icon is located at bounding box [655, 515, 759, 713] and the text \\'Retro Music\\' is visible below it (as part of \\'Pro Expense Retro Music\\').

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to reveal the list of installed applications, where I can then find and open the Retro Music app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Retro Music app. The Retro Music app is not visible on the current screen, so scrolling will be necessary.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down in the app drawer. This is done to find the \\'Retro Music\\' app, which is not currently visible on the screen. The expected outcome is that more apps will be revealed, hopefully including \\'Retro Music\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, and the \\'Retro Music\\' app is now visible on the screen. The app icon is located at bounding box [655, 515, 759, 713] and the text \\'Retro Music\\' is visible below it (as part of \\'Pro Expense Retro Music\\'). This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Retro Music app.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 2: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to reveal the list of installed applications, where I can then find and open the Retro Music app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Retro Music app. The Retro Music app is not visible on the current screen, so scrolling will be necessary.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down in the app drawer. This is done to find the \\'Retro Music\\' app, which is not currently visible on the screen. The expected outcome is that more apps will be revealed, hopefully including \\'Retro Music\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, and the \\'Retro Music\\' app is now visible on the screen. The app icon is located at bounding box [655, 515, 759, 713] and the text \\'Retro Music\\' is visible below it (as part of \\'Pro Expense Retro Music\\'). This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Retro Music app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[707,614],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Retro Music\\' app icon, which is currently visible on the screen at coordinates [707, 614]. This action is expected to launch the Retro Music application, bringing me to its main interface. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Retro Music\\' app icon successfully launched the application. The Retro Music app is now open and displaying the \\'Playlists\\' screen. This completes the active subgoal of opening the Retro Music app and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.37\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [76, 397, 107, 609], \\'text\\': \\'Playlists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [545, 222, 577, 779], \\'text\\': \\'You have no playlists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [945, 837, 962, 967], \\'text\\': \\'Playlists\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [907, 243, 957, 358]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [899, 799, 970, 994]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [904, 643, 966, 763]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [908, 47, 957, 153]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [907, 444, 958, 559]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 917, 109, 978]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [75, 394, 107, 607]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to reveal the list of installed applications, where I can then find and open the Retro Music app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Retro Music app. The Retro Music app is not visible on the current screen, so scrolling will be necessary.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down in the app drawer. This is done to find the \\'Retro Music\\' app, which is not currently visible on the screen. The expected outcome is that more apps will be revealed, hopefully including \\'Retro Music\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, and the \\'Retro Music\\' app is now visible on the screen. The app icon is located at bounding box [655, 515, 759, 713] and the text \\'Retro Music\\' is visible below it (as part of \\'Pro Expense Retro Music\\'). This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Retro Music app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[707,614],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Retro Music\\' app icon, which is currently visible on the screen at coordinates [707, 614]. This action is expected to launch the Retro Music application, bringing me to its main interface. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Retro Music\\' app icon successfully launched the application. The Retro Music app is now open and displaying the \\'Playlists\\' screen. This completes the active subgoal of opening the Retro Music app and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 3: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,65],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon located at approximately [85, 65] in the top left corner of the screen. This action is expected to open the search interface within the Retro Music app, allowing me to search for the song \\'Through the Storm\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Retro Music app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Retro Music app is open and its main interface is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to reveal the list of installed applications, where I can then find and open the Retro Music app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Retro Music app. The Retro Music app is not visible on the current screen, so scrolling will be necessary.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down in the app drawer. This is done to find the \\'Retro Music\\' app, which is not currently visible on the screen. The expected outcome is that more apps will be revealed, hopefully including \\'Retro Music\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, and the \\'Retro Music\\' app is now visible on the screen. The app icon is located at bounding box [655, 515, 759, 713] and the text \\'Retro Music\\' is visible below it (as part of \\'Pro Expense Retro Music\\'). This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Retro Music app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[707,614],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Retro Music\\' app icon, which is currently visible on the screen at coordinates [707, 614]. This action is expected to launch the Retro Music application, bringing me to its main interface. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Retro Music\\' app icon successfully launched the application. The Retro Music app is now open and displaying the \\'Playlists\\' screen. This completes the active subgoal of opening the Retro Music app and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,65],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon located at approximately [85, 65] in the top left corner of the screen. This action is expected to open the search interface within the Retro Music app, allowing me to search for the song \\'Through the Storm\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the search icon at [85, 65] failed to produce any change on the screen. The application remains on the \\'Playlists\\' page, indicating \\'You have no playlists\\'. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The failure likely occurred because the search functionality is not directly accessible or active from the current \\'Playlists\\' screen, especially when it\\'s empty. To proceed, the agent needs to navigate to a different section of the app, like the main songs library, where searching for songs is typically possible.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.38\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [76, 397, 107, 609], \\'text\\': \\'Playlists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [545, 222, 577, 779], \\'text\\': \\'You have no playlists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [945, 837, 962, 967], \\'text\\': \\'Playlists\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [907, 242, 957, 359]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [899, 818, 935, 980]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [904, 643, 967, 764]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [908, 46, 957, 153]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [907, 445, 959, 558]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 821, 40, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 904, 39, 945]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 917, 109, 978]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to reveal the list of installed applications, where I can then find and open the Retro Music app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Retro Music app. The Retro Music app is not visible on the current screen, so scrolling will be necessary.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down in the app drawer. This is done to find the \\'Retro Music\\' app, which is not currently visible on the screen. The expected outcome is that more apps will be revealed, hopefully including \\'Retro Music\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, and the \\'Retro Music\\' app is now visible on the screen. The app icon is located at bounding box [655, 515, 759, 713] and the text \\'Retro Music\\' is visible below it (as part of \\'Pro Expense Retro Music\\'). This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Retro Music app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[707,614],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Retro Music\\' app icon, which is currently visible on the screen at coordinates [707, 614]. This action is expected to launch the Retro Music application, bringing me to its main interface. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Retro Music\\' app icon successfully launched the application. The Retro Music app is now open and displaying the \\'Playlists\\' screen. This completes the active subgoal of opening the Retro Music app and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,65],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon located at approximately [85, 65] in the top left corner of the screen. This action is expected to open the search interface within the Retro Music app, allowing me to search for the song \\'Through the Storm\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the search icon at [85, 65] failed to produce any change on the screen. The application remains on the \\'Playlists\\' page, indicating \\'You have no playlists\\'. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The failure likely occurred because the search functionality is not directly accessible or active from the current \\'Playlists\\' screen, especially when it\\'s empty. To proceed, the agent needs to navigate to a different section of the app, like the main songs library, where searching for songs is typically possible.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 4: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[932,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the music note icon (Songs) in the bottom navigation bar, located at approximately [932, 300]. This action is expected to navigate to the songs list/library within the Retro Music app, where I can then search for and add songs to the queue. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Retro Music app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Retro Music app is open and its main interface is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to reveal the list of installed applications, where I can then find and open the Retro Music app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Retro Music app. The Retro Music app is not visible on the current screen, so scrolling will be necessary.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down in the app drawer. This is done to find the \\'Retro Music\\' app, which is not currently visible on the screen. The expected outcome is that more apps will be revealed, hopefully including \\'Retro Music\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, and the \\'Retro Music\\' app is now visible on the screen. The app icon is located at bounding box [655, 515, 759, 713] and the text \\'Retro Music\\' is visible below it (as part of \\'Pro Expense Retro Music\\'). This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Retro Music app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[707,614],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Retro Music\\' app icon, which is currently visible on the screen at coordinates [707, 614]. This action is expected to launch the Retro Music application, bringing me to its main interface. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Retro Music\\' app icon successfully launched the application. The Retro Music app is now open and displaying the \\'Playlists\\' screen. This completes the active subgoal of opening the Retro Music app and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,65],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon located at approximately [85, 65] in the top left corner of the screen. This action is expected to open the search interface within the Retro Music app, allowing me to search for the song \\'Through the Storm\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the search icon at [85, 65] failed to produce any change on the screen. The application remains on the \\'Playlists\\' page, indicating \\'You have no playlists\\'. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The failure likely occurred because the search functionality is not directly accessible or active from the current \\'Playlists\\' screen, especially when it\\'s empty. To proceed, the agent needs to navigate to a different section of the app, like the main songs library, where searching for songs is typically possible.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[932,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the music note icon (Songs) in the bottom navigation bar, located at approximately [932, 300]. This action is expected to navigate to the songs list/library within the Retro Music app, where I can then search for and add songs to the queue. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Songs\\' icon (music note) in the bottom navigation bar successfully navigated the app to the \\'Songs\\' list/library. The screen now displays a list of available songs. This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"Search\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nAdd the following songs, in order, Through the Storm, Hidden Paths, Forever Young, Whispers of the Past, Heartbeat Away to my playing queue in Retro music.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,540],\"end_point\":[600,540],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (coordinates [900, 540]) to the middle of the screen (coordinates [600, 540]) to open the app drawer. This action is expected to reveal the list of installed applications, where I can then find and open the Retro Music app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Retro Music app. The Retro Music app is not visible on the current screen, so scrolling will be necessary.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down in the app drawer. This is done to find the \\'Retro Music\\' app, which is not currently visible on the screen. The expected outcome is that more apps will be revealed, hopefully including \\'Retro Music\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, and the \\'Retro Music\\' app is now visible on the screen. The app icon is located at bounding box [655, 515, 759, 713] and the text \\'Retro Music\\' is visible below it (as part of \\'Pro Expense Retro Music\\'). This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Retro Music app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[707,614],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Retro Music\\' app icon, which is currently visible on the screen at coordinates [707, 614]. This action is expected to launch the Retro Music application, bringing me to its main interface. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Retro Music\\' app icon successfully launched the application. The Retro Music app is now open and displaying the \\'Playlists\\' screen. This completes the active subgoal of opening the Retro Music app and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,65],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon located at approximately [85, 65] in the top left corner of the screen. This action is expected to open the search interface within the Retro Music app, allowing me to search for the song \\'Through the Storm\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the search icon at [85, 65] failed to produce any change on the screen. The application remains on the \\'Playlists\\' page, indicating \\'You have no playlists\\'. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The failure likely occurred because the search functionality is not directly accessible or active from the current \\'Playlists\\' screen, especially when it\\'s empty. To proceed, the agent needs to navigate to a different section of the app, like the main songs library, where searching for songs is typically possible.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[932,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the music note icon (Songs) in the bottom navigation bar, located at approximately [932, 300]. This action is expected to navigate to the songs list/library within the Retro Music app, where I can then search for and add songs to the queue. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Songs\\' icon (music note) in the bottom navigation bar successfully navigated the app to the \\'Songs\\' list/library. The screen now displays a list of available songs. This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 5: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,65],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon located at approximately [85, 65] in the top left corner of the \\'Songs\\' screen. This action is expected to open the search interface, allowing me to search for the song \\'Through the Storm\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Retro Music app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Retro Music app is open and its main interface is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

This is done to find the \\'Retro Music\\' app, which is not currently visible on the screen. The expected outcome is that more apps will be revealed, hopefully including \\'Retro Music\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, and the \\'Retro Music\\' app is now visible on the screen. The app icon is located at bounding box [655, 515, 759, 713] and the text \\'Retro Music\\' is visible below it (as part of \\'Pro Expense Retro Music\\'). This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Retro Music app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[707,614],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Retro Music\\' app icon, which is currently visible on the screen at coordinates [707, 614]. This action is expected to launch the Retro Music application, bringing me to its main interface. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Retro Music\\' app icon successfully launched the application. The Retro Music app is now open and displaying the \\'Playlists\\' screen. This completes the active subgoal of opening the Retro Music app and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,65],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon located at approximately [85, 65] in the top left corner of the screen. This action is expected to open the search interface within the Retro Music app, allowing me to search for the song \\'Through the Storm\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the search icon at [85, 65] failed to produce any change on the screen. The application remains on the \\'Playlists\\' page, indicating \\'You have no playlists\\'. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The failure likely occurred because the search functionality is not directly accessible or active from the current \\'Playlists\\' screen, especially when it\\'s empty. To proceed, the agent needs to navigate to a different section of the app, like the main songs library, where searching for songs is typically possible.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[932,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the music note icon (Songs) in the bottom navigation bar, located at approximately [932, 300]. This action is expected to navigate to the songs list/library within the Retro Music app, where I can then search for and add songs to the queue. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Songs\\' icon (music note) in the bottom navigation bar successfully navigated the app to the \\'Songs\\' list/library. The screen now displays a list of available songs. This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,65],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon located at approximately [85, 65] in the top left corner of the \\'Songs\\' screen. This action is expected to open the search interface, allowing me to search for the song \\'Through the Storm\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the search icon successfully opened the search interface. The screen now displays a search field with the placeholder \\'Search\\', and the virtual keyboard is active. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.39\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [75, 168, 102, 302], \\'text\\': \\'|earch\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [144, 48, 168, 172], \\'text\\': \\'Songs\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [147, 268, 163, 391], \\'text\\': \\'Artists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [146, 490, 163, 630], \\'text\\': \\'Albums\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [145, 729, 163, 952], \\'text\\': \\'Album artist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [480, 386, 502, 622], \\'text\\': \\'No results\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [778, 694, 808, 918], \\'text\\': \\'Keyboard\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 444, 179, 669]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 222, 179, 432]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 681, 179, 990]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 8, 179, 210]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [760, 565, 823, 966]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 902, 110, 982]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [13, 816, 42, 949]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 194, 38, 244]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"1\", text=\"Search\", resource-id=\"code.name.monkey.retromusic:id/searchView\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"code.name.monkey.retromusic\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[147,148][953,275]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"Search\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is done to find the \\'Retro Music\\' app, which is not currently visible on the screen. The expected outcome is that more apps will be revealed, hopefully including \\'Retro Music\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, and the \\'Retro Music\\' app is now visible on the screen. The app icon is located at bounding box [655, 515, 759, 713] and the text \\'Retro Music\\' is visible below it (as part of \\'Pro Expense Retro Music\\'). This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Retro Music app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[707,614],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Retro Music\\' app icon, which is currently visible on the screen at coordinates [707, 614]. This action is expected to launch the Retro Music application, bringing me to its main interface. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Retro Music\\' app icon successfully launched the application. The Retro Music app is now open and displaying the \\'Playlists\\' screen. This completes the active subgoal of opening the Retro Music app and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,65],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon located at approximately [85, 65] in the top left corner of the screen. This action is expected to open the search interface within the Retro Music app, allowing me to search for the song \\'Through the Storm\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the search icon at [85, 65] failed to produce any change on the screen. The application remains on the \\'Playlists\\' page, indicating \\'You have no playlists\\'. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The failure likely occurred because the search functionality is not directly accessible or active from the current \\'Playlists\\' screen, especially when it\\'s empty. To proceed, the agent needs to navigate to a different section of the app, like the main songs library, where searching for songs is typically possible.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[932,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the music note icon (Songs) in the bottom navigation bar, located at approximately [932, 300]. This action is expected to navigate to the songs list/library within the Retro Music app, where I can then search for and add songs to the queue. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Songs\\' icon (music note) in the bottom navigation bar successfully navigated the app to the \\'Songs\\' list/library. The screen now displays a list of available songs. This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,65],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon located at approximately [85, 65] in the top left corner of the \\'Songs\\' screen. This action is expected to open the search interface, allowing me to search for the song \\'Through the Storm\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the search icon successfully opened the search interface. The screen now displays a search field with the placeholder \\'Search\\', and the virtual keyboard is active. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 6: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Through the Storm\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Through the Storm\\\\n\\' into the focused search field. The search field currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'Through the Storm\\' and the newline character will initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for the song and display the results. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Retro Music app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Retro Music app is open and its main interface is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[707,614],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Retro Music\\' app icon, which is currently visible on the screen at coordinates [707, 614]. This action is expected to launch the Retro Music application, bringing me to its main interface. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Retro Music\\' app icon successfully launched the application. The Retro Music app is now open and displaying the \\'Playlists\\' screen. This completes the active subgoal of opening the Retro Music app and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,65],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon located at approximately [85, 65] in the top left corner of the screen. This action is expected to open the search interface within the Retro Music app, allowing me to search for the song \\'Through the Storm\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the search icon at [85, 65] failed to produce any change on the screen. The application remains on the \\'Playlists\\' page, indicating \\'You have no playlists\\'. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The failure likely occurred because the search functionality is not directly accessible or active from the current \\'Playlists\\' screen, especially when it\\'s empty. To proceed, the agent needs to navigate to a different section of the app, like the main songs library, where searching for songs is typically possible.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[932,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the music note icon (Songs) in the bottom navigation bar, located at approximately [932, 300]. This action is expected to navigate to the songs list/library within the Retro Music app, where I can then search for and add songs to the queue. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Songs\\' icon (music note) in the bottom navigation bar successfully navigated the app to the \\'Songs\\' list/library. The screen now displays a list of available songs. This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,65],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon located at approximately [85, 65] in the top left corner of the \\'Songs\\' screen. This action is expected to open the search interface, allowing me to search for the song \\'Through the Storm\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the search icon successfully opened the search interface. The screen now displays a search field with the placeholder \\'Search\\', and the virtual keyboard is active. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Through the Storm\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Through the Storm\\\\n\\' into the focused search field. The search field currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'Through the Storm\\' and the newline character will initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for the song and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Through the Storm\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and the song \\'Through the Storm\\' is now visible in the search results. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the song to the queue.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.39\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [80, 171, 101, 507], \\'text\\': \\'Through the Storm\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [144, 48, 168, 172], \\'text\\': \\'Songs\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [146, 268, 163, 391], \\'text\\': \\'Artists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [146, 490, 163, 630], \\'text\\': \\'Albums\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [145, 729, 163, 952], \\'text\\': \\'Album artist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [202, 19, 214, 122], \\'text\\': \\'SONG S\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [245, 186, 265, 522], \\'text\\': \\'Through the Storm\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [272, 188, 288, 289], \\'text\\': \\'Music\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [778, 694, 808, 918], \\'text\\': \\'Keyboard\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 444, 179, 669]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 681, 179, 990]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 222, 179, 431]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 8, 179, 210]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [760, 564, 823, 966]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [73, 906, 108, 979]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [240, 35, 294, 158]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 37, 243]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [243, 884, 294, 993]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [13, 816, 41, 950]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"2\", text=\"Albums\", resource-id=\"code.name.monkey.retromusic:id/chip_albums\", class=\"android.widget.RadioButton\", package=\"code.name.monkey.retromusic\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"true\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"false\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[483,309][719,435]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"Albums\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[707,614],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Retro Music\\' app icon, which is currently visible on the screen at coordinates [707, 614]. This action is expected to launch the Retro Music application, bringing me to its main interface. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Retro Music\\' app icon successfully launched the application. The Retro Music app is now open and displaying the \\'Playlists\\' screen. This completes the active subgoal of opening the Retro Music app and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,65],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon located at approximately [85, 65] in the top left corner of the screen. This action is expected to open the search interface within the Retro Music app, allowing me to search for the song \\'Through the Storm\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the search icon at [85, 65] failed to produce any change on the screen. The application remains on the \\'Playlists\\' page, indicating \\'You have no playlists\\'. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The failure likely occurred because the search functionality is not directly accessible or active from the current \\'Playlists\\' screen, especially when it\\'s empty. To proceed, the agent needs to navigate to a different section of the app, like the main songs library, where searching for songs is typically possible.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[932,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the music note icon (Songs) in the bottom navigation bar, located at approximately [932, 300]. This action is expected to navigate to the songs list/library within the Retro Music app, where I can then search for and add songs to the queue. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Songs\\' icon (music note) in the bottom navigation bar successfully navigated the app to the \\'Songs\\' list/library. The screen now displays a list of available songs. This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,65],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon located at approximately [85, 65] in the top left corner of the \\'Songs\\' screen. This action is expected to open the search interface, allowing me to search for the song \\'Through the Storm\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the search icon successfully opened the search interface. The screen now displays a search field with the placeholder \\'Search\\', and the virtual keyboard is active. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Through the Storm\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Through the Storm\\\\n\\' into the focused search field. The search field currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'Through the Storm\\' and the newline character will initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for the song and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Through the Storm\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and the song \\'Through the Storm\\' is now visible in the search results. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the song to the queue.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 7: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located to the right of the song \\'Through the Storm\\'. The icon is within the bounding box [243, 884, 294, 993]. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to queue\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Retro Music app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Retro Music app is open and its main interface is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,65],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon located at approximately [85, 65] in the top left corner of the screen. This action is expected to open the search interface within the Retro Music app, allowing me to search for the song \\'Through the Storm\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the search icon at [85, 65] failed to produce any change on the screen. The application remains on the \\'Playlists\\' page, indicating \\'You have no playlists\\'. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The failure likely occurred because the search functionality is not directly accessible or active from the current \\'Playlists\\' screen, especially when it\\'s empty. To proceed, the agent needs to navigate to a different section of the app, like the main songs library, where searching for songs is typically possible.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[932,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the music note icon (Songs) in the bottom navigation bar, located at approximately [932, 300]. This action is expected to navigate to the songs list/library within the Retro Music app, where I can then search for and add songs to the queue. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Songs\\' icon (music note) in the bottom navigation bar successfully navigated the app to the \\'Songs\\' list/library. The screen now displays a list of available songs. This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,65],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon located at approximately [85, 65] in the top left corner of the \\'Songs\\' screen. This action is expected to open the search interface, allowing me to search for the song \\'Through the Storm\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the search icon successfully opened the search interface. The screen now displays a search field with the placeholder \\'Search\\', and the virtual keyboard is active. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Through the Storm\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Through the Storm\\\\n\\' into the focused search field. The search field currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'Through the Storm\\' and the newline character will initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for the song and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Through the Storm\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and the song \\'Through the Storm\\' is now visible in the search results. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the song to the queue.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located to the right of the song \\'Through the Storm\\'. The icon is within the bounding box [243, 884, 294, 993]. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to queue\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon next to \\'Through the Storm\\' successfully opened a context menu. This menu provides several actions related to the song, including the desired \\'Add to playing queue\\' option. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the necessary option to add the song to the queue is now accessible.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.40\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [80, 171, 101, 507], \\'text\\': \\'Through the Storm\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [144, 48, 168, 172], \\'text\\': \\'Songs\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [146, 268, 163, 391], \\'text\\': \\'Artists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [146, 490, 163, 630], \\'text\\': \\'Albums\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [145, 729, 163, 952], \\'text\\': \\'Album artist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [202, 19, 214, 122], \\'text\\': \\'SONG S\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [245, 186, 265, 522], \\'text\\': \\'Through the Storm\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [272, 188, 288, 289], \\'text\\': \\'Music\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [320, 558, 342, 735], \\'text\\': \\'Play next\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [373, 561, 397, 955], \\'text\\': \\'Add to playing queue\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [425, 562, 448, 833], \\'text\\': \\'Add to playlist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [478, 561, 496, 787], \\'text\\': \\'Go to album\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [531, 561, 548, 775], \\'text\\': \\'Go to artist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [583, 559, 601, 671], \\'text\\': \\'Share\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [635, 560, 658, 753], \\'text\\': \\'Tag editor\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [688, 561, 706, 693], \\'text\\': \\'Details\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [740, 558, 762, 844], \\'text\\': \\'Set as ringtone\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [793, 563, 811, 854], \\'text\\': \\'Add to Blacklist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [846, 561, 863, 910], \\'text\\': \\'Delete from device\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 444, 179, 670]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 681, 179, 991]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 221, 179, 431]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 8, 179, 210]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 904, 108, 981]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [777, 532, 829, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [244, 896, 288, 986]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 38, 243]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [12, 815, 42, 952]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information.

To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,65],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon located at approximately [85, 65] in the top left corner of the screen. This action is expected to open the search interface within the Retro Music app, allowing me to search for the song \\'Through the Storm\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the search icon at [85, 65] failed to produce any change on the screen. The application remains on the \\'Playlists\\' page, indicating \\'You have no playlists\\'. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The failure likely occurred because the search functionality is not directly accessible or active from the current \\'Playlists\\' screen, especially when it\\'s empty. To proceed, the agent needs to navigate to a different section of the app, like the main songs library, where searching for songs is typically possible.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[932,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the music note icon (Songs) in the bottom navigation bar, located at approximately [932, 300]. This action is expected to navigate to the songs list/library within the Retro Music app, where I can then search for and add songs to the queue. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Songs\\' icon (music note) in the bottom navigation bar successfully navigated the app to the \\'Songs\\' list/library. The screen now displays a list of available songs. This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,65],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon located at approximately [85, 65] in the top left corner of the \\'Songs\\' screen. This action is expected to open the search interface, allowing me to search for the song \\'Through the Storm\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the search icon successfully opened the search interface. The screen now displays a search field with the placeholder \\'Search\\', and the virtual keyboard is active. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Through the Storm\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Through the Storm\\\\n\\' into the focused search field. The search field currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'Through the Storm\\' and the newline character will initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for the song and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Through the Storm\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and the song \\'Through the Storm\\' is now visible in the search results. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the song to the queue.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located to the right of the song \\'Through the Storm\\'. The icon is within the bounding box [243, 884, 294, 993]. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to queue\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon next to \\'Through the Storm\\' successfully opened a context menu. This menu provides several actions related to the song, including the desired \\'Add to playing queue\\' option. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the necessary option to add the song to the queue is now accessible.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 8: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[385,758],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playing queue\\' option in the context menu. The option is located at approximately [385, 758]. This action is expected to add the song \\'Through the Storm\\' to the playing queue. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Retro Music app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Retro Music app is open and its main interface is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[932,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the music note icon (Songs) in the bottom navigation bar, located at approximately [932, 300]. This action is expected to navigate to the songs list/library within the Retro Music app, where I can then search for and add songs to the queue. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Songs\\' icon (music note) in the bottom navigation bar successfully navigated the app to the \\'Songs\\' list/library. The screen now displays a list of available songs. This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,65],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon located at approximately [85, 65] in the top left corner of the \\'Songs\\' screen. This action is expected to open the search interface, allowing me to search for the song \\'Through the Storm\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the search icon successfully opened the search interface. The screen now displays a search field with the placeholder \\'Search\\', and the virtual keyboard is active. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Through the Storm\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Through the Storm\\\\n\\' into the focused search field. The search field currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'Through the Storm\\' and the newline character will initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for the song and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Through the Storm\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and the song \\'Through the Storm\\' is now visible in the search results. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the song to the queue.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located to the right of the song \\'Through the Storm\\'. The icon is within the bounding box [243, 884, 294, 993]. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to queue\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon next to \\'Through the Storm\\' successfully opened a context menu. This menu provides several actions related to the song, including the desired \\'Add to playing queue\\' option. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the necessary option to add the song to the queue is now accessible.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[385,758],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playing queue\\' option in the context menu. The option is located at approximately [385, 758]. This action is expected to add the song \\'Through the Storm\\' to the playing queue. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playing queue\\' was successful. The song \\'Through the Storm\\' was added to the playing queue, as evidenced by the appearance of a mini-player at the bottom of the screen showing the song title and artist. The context menu disappeared. The screen remains on the search results page for \\'Through the Storm\\', with the search interface still active (indicated by the \\'Keyboard\\' button). This action successfully completed the task of adding the first song to the queue.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.40\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [80, 171, 101, 507], \\'text\\': \\'Through the Storm\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [144, 48, 168, 172], \\'text\\': \\'Songs\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [146, 268, 163, 391], \\'text\\': \\'Artists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [146, 490, 163, 630], \\'text\\': \\'Albums\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [145, 729, 163, 952], \\'text\\': \\'Album artist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [202, 19, 214, 122], \\'text\\': \\'SONG S\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [245, 186, 265, 522], \\'text\\': \\'Through the Storm\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [272, 188, 288, 289], \\'text\\': \\'Music\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [765, 697, 793, 917], \\'text\\': \\'Keyboard\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [848, 171, 867, 565], \\'text\\': \\'Through the Storm Liam\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [920, 867, 941, 927], \\'text\\': \\'=\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [945, 251, 961, 350], \\'text\\': \\'Songs\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 444, 179, 669]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 681, 179, 990]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 222, 179, 431]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 8, 179, 210]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [746, 567, 809, 964]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [899, 210, 970, 387]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [908, 840, 955, 961]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [905, 49, 959, 150]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [242, 883, 294, 993]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [73, 906, 108, 979]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 37, 243]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [13, 817, 41, 950]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [900, 629, 984, 772]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [240, 35, 294, 158]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible.

Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[932,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the music note icon (Songs) in the bottom navigation bar, located at approximately [932, 300]. This action is expected to navigate to the songs list/library within the Retro Music app, where I can then search for and add songs to the queue. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Songs\\' icon (music note) in the bottom navigation bar successfully navigated the app to the \\'Songs\\' list/library. The screen now displays a list of available songs. This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,65],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon located at approximately [85, 65] in the top left corner of the \\'Songs\\' screen. This action is expected to open the search interface, allowing me to search for the song \\'Through the Storm\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the search icon successfully opened the search interface. The screen now displays a search field with the placeholder \\'Search\\', and the virtual keyboard is active. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Through the Storm\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Through the Storm\\\\n\\' into the focused search field. The search field currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'Through the Storm\\' and the newline character will initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for the song and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Through the Storm\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and the song \\'Through the Storm\\' is now visible in the search results. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the song to the queue.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located to the right of the song \\'Through the Storm\\'. The icon is within the bounding box [243, 884, 294, 993]. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to queue\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon next to \\'Through the Storm\\' successfully opened a context menu. This menu provides several actions related to the song, including the desired \\'Add to playing queue\\' option. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the necessary option to add the song to the queue is now accessible.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[385,758],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playing queue\\' option in the context menu. The option is located at approximately [385, 758]. This action is expected to add the song \\'Through the Storm\\' to the playing queue. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playing queue\\' was successful. The song \\'Through the Storm\\' was added to the playing queue, as evidenced by the appearance of a mini-player at the bottom of the screen showing the song title and artist. The context menu disappeared. The screen remains on the search results page for \\'Through the Storm\\', with the search interface still active (indicated by the \\'Keyboard\\' button). This action successfully completed the task of adding the first song to the queue.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 9: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) next to the current search term \\'Through the Storm\\' at the top of the screen. The icon is located at approximately [88, 938]. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing me to input the next song title, \\'Hidden Paths\\'.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,65],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon located at approximately [85, 65] in the top left corner of the \\'Songs\\' screen. This action is expected to open the search interface, allowing me to search for the song \\'Through the Storm\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the search icon successfully opened the search interface. The screen now displays a search field with the placeholder \\'Search\\', and the virtual keyboard is active. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Through the Storm\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Through the Storm\\\\n\\' into the focused search field. The search field currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'Through the Storm\\' and the newline character will initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for the song and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Through the Storm\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and the song \\'Through the Storm\\' is now visible in the search results. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the song to the queue.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located to the right of the song \\'Through the Storm\\'. The icon is within the bounding box [243, 884, 294, 993]. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to queue\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon next to \\'Through the Storm\\' successfully opened a context menu. This menu provides several actions related to the song, including the desired \\'Add to playing queue\\' option. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the necessary option to add the song to the queue is now accessible.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[385,758],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playing queue\\' option in the context menu. The option is located at approximately [385, 758]. This action is expected to add the song \\'Through the Storm\\' to the playing queue. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playing queue\\' was successful. The song \\'Through the Storm\\' was added to the playing queue, as evidenced by the appearance of a mini-player at the bottom of the screen showing the song title and artist. The context menu disappeared. The screen remains on the search results page for \\'Through the Storm\\', with the search interface still active (indicated by the \\'Keyboard\\' button). This action successfully completed the task of adding the first song to the queue.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) next to the current search term \\'Through the Storm\\' at the top of the screen. The icon is located at approximately [88, 938]. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing me to input the next song title, \\'Hidden Paths\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'x\\' icon successfully cleared the search field. The previous search term \\'Through the Storm\\' is no longer present, and the search field now displays \\'Search\\'. The main content area shows \\'No results\\'. This action was successful and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the search interface for the next song.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 132], \\'text\\': \\'15.41\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [80, 171, 97, 298], \\'text\\': \\'Search\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [144, 48, 168, 172], \\'text\\': \\'Songs\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [147, 268, 163, 391], \\'text\\': \\'Artists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [146, 490, 163, 630], \\'text\\': \\'Albums\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [145, 729, 163, 952], \\'text\\': \\'Album artist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [505, 386, 526, 622], \\'text\\': \\'No results\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [765, 697, 793, 917], \\'text\\': \\'Keyboard\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [848, 171, 867, 565], \\'text\\': \\'Through the Storm Liam\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [920, 867, 941, 927], \\'text\\': \\'=\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [945, 251, 961, 350], \\'text\\': \\'Songs\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 444, 179, 669]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 222, 179, 432]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 681, 179, 990]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 8, 180, 210]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [746, 567, 809, 964]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [899, 210, 969, 386]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [904, 51, 960, 151]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [908, 841, 956, 960]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 902, 110, 982]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [898, 364, 1000, 634]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 194, 38, 244]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [905, 642, 963, 761]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [833, 34, 881, 141]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 815, 39, 946]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen.

For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to open the search interface, allowing me to search for the song \\'Through the Storm\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the search icon successfully opened the search interface. The screen now displays a search field with the placeholder \\'Search\\', and the virtual keyboard is active. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Through the Storm\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Through the Storm\\\\n\\' into the focused search field. The search field currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'Through the Storm\\' and the newline character will initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for the song and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Through the Storm\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and the song \\'Through the Storm\\' is now visible in the search results. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the song to the queue.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located to the right of the song \\'Through the Storm\\'. The icon is within the bounding box [243, 884, 294, 993]. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to queue\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon next to \\'Through the Storm\\' successfully opened a context menu. This menu provides several actions related to the song, including the desired \\'Add to playing queue\\' option. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the necessary option to add the song to the queue is now accessible.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[385,758],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playing queue\\' option in the context menu.

Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playing queue\\' was successful. The song \\'Through the Storm\\' was added to the playing queue, as evidenced by the appearance of a mini-player at the bottom of the screen showing the song title and artist. The context menu disappeared. The screen remains on the search results page for \\'Through the Storm\\', with the search interface still active (indicated by the \\'Keyboard\\' button). This action successfully completed the task of adding the first song to the queue.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

The icon is located at approximately [88, 938]. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing me to input the next song title, \\'Hidden Paths\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'x\\' icon successfully cleared the search field. The previous search term \\'Through the Storm\\' is no longer present, and the search field now displays \\'Search\\'. The main content area shows \\'No results\\'. This action was successful and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the search interface for the next song.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 10: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The search field currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'Through the Storm\\' and the newline character will initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for the song and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Through the Storm\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and the song \\'Through the Storm\\' is now visible in the search results. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the song to the queue.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located to the right of the song \\'Through the Storm\\'. The icon is within the bounding box [243, 884, 294, 993]. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to queue\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon next to \\'Through the Storm\\' successfully opened a context menu. This menu provides several actions related to the song, including the desired \\'Add to playing queue\\' option. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the necessary option to add the song to the queue is now accessible.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[385,758],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playing queue\\' option in the context menu. The option is located at approximately [385, 758]. This action is expected to add the song \\'Through the Storm\\' to the playing queue. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playing queue\\' was successful. The song \\'Through the Storm\\' was added to the playing queue, as evidenced by the appearance of a mini-player at the bottom of the screen showing the song title and artist. The context menu disappeared. The screen remains on the search results page for \\'Through the Storm\\', with the search interface still active (indicated by the \\'Keyboard\\' button). This action successfully completed the task of adding the first song to the queue.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) next to the current search term \\'Through the Storm\\' at the top of the screen. The icon is located at approximately [88, 938]. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing me to input the next song title, \\'Hidden Paths\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'x\\' icon successfully cleared the search field. The previous search term \\'Through the Storm\\' is no longer present, and the search field now displays \\'Search\\'. The main content area shows \\'No results\\'. This action was successful and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the search interface for the next song.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field, which currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. The search field is located at approximately [88, 234]. This action is expected to activate the search field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to input the song title \\'Hidden Paths\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field at [88, 234] was successful. The search field is now active, indicated by the cursor, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen. This prepares the interface for inputting the next song title, \\'Hidden Paths\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The search field currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'Through the Storm\\' and the newline character will initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for the song and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Through the Storm\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and the song \\'Through the Storm\\' is now visible in the search results. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the song to the queue.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located to the right of the song \\'Through the Storm\\'. The icon is within the bounding box [243, 884, 294, 993]. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to queue\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon next to \\'Through the Storm\\' successfully opened a context menu. This menu provides several actions related to the song, including the desired \\'Add to playing queue\\' option. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the necessary option to add the song to the queue is now accessible.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[385,758],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playing queue\\' option in the context menu. The option is located at approximately [385, 758]. This action is expected to add the song \\'Through the Storm\\' to the playing queue. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playing queue\\' was successful. The song \\'Through the Storm\\' was added to the playing queue, as evidenced by the appearance of a mini-player at the bottom of the screen showing the song title and artist. The context menu disappeared. The screen remains on the search results page for \\'Through the Storm\\', with the search interface still active (indicated by the \\'Keyboard\\' button). This action successfully completed the task of adding the first song to the queue.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) next to the current search term \\'Through the Storm\\' at the top of the screen. The icon is located at approximately [88, 938]. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing me to input the next song title, \\'Hidden Paths\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'x\\' icon successfully cleared the search field. The previous search term \\'Through the Storm\\' is no longer present, and the search field now displays \\'Search\\'. The main content area shows \\'No results\\'. This action was successful and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the search interface for the next song.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field, which currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. The search field is located at approximately [88, 234]. This action is expected to activate the search field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to input the song title \\'Hidden Paths\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field at [88, 234] was successful. The search field is now active, indicated by the cursor, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen. This prepares the interface for inputting the next song title, \\'Hidden Paths\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 11: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Hidden Paths\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Hidden Paths\\\\n\\' into the focused search field. The search field currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'Hidden Paths\\' and the newline character will initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for the song \\'Hidden Paths\\' and display the results.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located to the right of the song \\'Through the Storm\\'. The icon is within the bounding box [243, 884, 294, 993]. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to queue\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon next to \\'Through the Storm\\' successfully opened a context menu. This menu provides several actions related to the song, including the desired \\'Add to playing queue\\' option. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the necessary option to add the song to the queue is now accessible.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[385,758],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playing queue\\' option in the context menu. The option is located at approximately [385, 758]. This action is expected to add the song \\'Through the Storm\\' to the playing queue. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playing queue\\' was successful. The song \\'Through the Storm\\' was added to the playing queue, as evidenced by the appearance of a mini-player at the bottom of the screen showing the song title and artist. The context menu disappeared. The screen remains on the search results page for \\'Through the Storm\\', with the search interface still active (indicated by the \\'Keyboard\\' button). This action successfully completed the task of adding the first song to the queue.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) next to the current search term \\'Through the Storm\\' at the top of the screen. The icon is located at approximately [88, 938]. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing me to input the next song title, \\'Hidden Paths\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'x\\' icon successfully cleared the search field. The previous search term \\'Through the Storm\\' is no longer present, and the search field now displays \\'Search\\'. The main content area shows \\'No results\\'. This action was successful and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the search interface for the next song.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field, which currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. The search field is located at approximately [88, 234]. This action is expected to activate the search field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to input the song title \\'Hidden Paths\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field at [88, 234] was successful. The search field is now active, indicated by the cursor, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen. This prepares the interface for inputting the next song title, \\'Hidden Paths\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Hidden Paths\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Hidden Paths\\\\n\\' into the focused search field. The search field currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'Hidden Paths\\' and the newline character will initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for the song \\'Hidden Paths\\' and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Hidden Paths\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and \\'Hidden Paths\\' is now visible in the search results. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the song to the queue.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located to the right of the song \\'Through the Storm\\'. The icon is within the bounding box [243, 884, 294, 993]. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to queue\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon next to \\'Through the Storm\\' successfully opened a context menu. This menu provides several actions related to the song, including the desired \\'Add to playing queue\\' option. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the necessary option to add the song to the queue is now accessible.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[385,758],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playing queue\\' option in the context menu. The option is located at approximately [385, 758]. This action is expected to add the song \\'Through the Storm\\' to the playing queue. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playing queue\\' was successful. The song \\'Through the Storm\\' was added to the playing queue, as evidenced by the appearance of a mini-player at the bottom of the screen showing the song title and artist. The context menu disappeared. The screen remains on the search results page for \\'Through the Storm\\', with the search interface still active (indicated by the \\'Keyboard\\' button). This action successfully completed the task of adding the first song to the queue.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) next to the current search term \\'Through the Storm\\' at the top of the screen. The icon is located at approximately [88, 938]. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing me to input the next song title, \\'Hidden Paths\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'x\\' icon successfully cleared the search field. The previous search term \\'Through the Storm\\' is no longer present, and the search field now displays \\'Search\\'. The main content area shows \\'No results\\'. This action was successful and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the search interface for the next song.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field, which currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. The search field is located at approximately [88, 234]. This action is expected to activate the search field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to input the song title \\'Hidden Paths\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field at [88, 234] was successful. The search field is now active, indicated by the cursor, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen. This prepares the interface for inputting the next song title, \\'Hidden Paths\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Hidden Paths\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Hidden Paths\\\\n\\' into the focused search field. The search field currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'Hidden Paths\\' and the newline character will initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for the song \\'Hidden Paths\\' and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Hidden Paths\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and \\'Hidden Paths\\' is now visible in the search results. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the song to the queue.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 12: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located to the right of the song \\'Hidden Paths\\'. The icon is within the bounding box [243, 884, 294, 993]. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playing queue\\'.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[385,758],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playing queue\\' option in the context menu. The option is located at approximately [385, 758]. This action is expected to add the song \\'Through the Storm\\' to the playing queue. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playing queue\\' was successful. The song \\'Through the Storm\\' was added to the playing queue, as evidenced by the appearance of a mini-player at the bottom of the screen showing the song title and artist. The context menu disappeared. The screen remains on the search results page for \\'Through the Storm\\', with the search interface still active (indicated by the \\'Keyboard\\' button). This action successfully completed the task of adding the first song to the queue.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) next to the current search term \\'Through the Storm\\' at the top of the screen. The icon is located at approximately [88, 938]. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing me to input the next song title, \\'Hidden Paths\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'x\\' icon successfully cleared the search field. The previous search term \\'Through the Storm\\' is no longer present, and the search field now displays \\'Search\\'. The main content area shows \\'No results\\'. This action was successful and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the search interface for the next song.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field, which currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. The search field is located at approximately [88, 234]. This action is expected to activate the search field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to input the song title \\'Hidden Paths\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field at [88, 234] was successful. The search field is now active, indicated by the cursor, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen. This prepares the interface for inputting the next song title, \\'Hidden Paths\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Hidden Paths\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Hidden Paths\\\\n\\' into the focused search field. The search field currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'Hidden Paths\\' and the newline character will initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for the song \\'Hidden Paths\\' and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Hidden Paths\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and \\'Hidden Paths\\' is now visible in the search results. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the song to the queue.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located to the right of the song \\'Hidden Paths\\'. The icon is within the bounding box [243, 884, 294, 993]. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playing queue\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon next to \\'Hidden Paths\\' successfully opened a context menu. This menu provides several actions related to the song, including the desired \\'Add to playing queue\\' option. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the necessary option to add the song to the queue is now accessible.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.43\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [80, 171, 97, 415], \\'text\\': \\'Hidden Paths\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [144, 48, 168, 172], \\'text\\': \\'Songs\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [147, 268, 163, 391], \\'text\\': \\'Artists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [146, 490, 163, 630], \\'text\\': \\'Albums\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [145, 729, 163, 952], \\'text\\': \\'Album artist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [202, 19, 214, 122], \\'text\\': \\'SONG S\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [244, 186, 263, 431], \\'text\\': \\'Hidden Paths\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [272, 188, 288, 289], \\'text\\': \\'Music\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [320, 558, 342, 735], \\'text\\': \\'Play next\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [373, 561, 397, 955], \\'text\\': \\'Add to playing queue\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [425, 562, 448, 833], \\'text\\': \\'Add to playlist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [478, 561, 496, 787], \\'text\\': \\'Go to album\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [531, 561, 548, 775], \\'text\\': \\'Go to artist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [583, 559, 601, 671], \\'text\\': \\'Share\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [635, 560, 658, 753], \\'text\\': \\'Tag editor\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [688, 561, 706, 693], \\'text\\': \\'Details\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [740, 558, 762, 844], \\'text\\': \\'Set as ringtone\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [793, 563, 811, 854], \\'text\\': \\'Add to Blacklist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [846, 171, 867, 910], \\'text\\': \\'Through the Storm Lic Delete from device\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 444, 179, 669]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 681, 179, 990]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 221, 179, 431]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 8, 179, 210]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [73, 906, 108, 979]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [777, 529, 829, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [244, 896, 288, 986]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 194, 38, 243]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [460, 539, 515, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [513, 544, 567, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [13, 816, 41, 951]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field.

Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[385,758],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playing queue\\' option in the context menu. The option is located at approximately [385, 758]. This action is expected to add the song \\'Through the Storm\\' to the playing queue. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playing queue\\' was successful. The song \\'Through the Storm\\' was added to the playing queue, as evidenced by the appearance of a mini-player at the bottom of the screen showing the song title and artist. The context menu disappeared. The screen remains on the search results page for \\'Through the Storm\\', with the search interface still active (indicated by the \\'Keyboard\\' button). This action successfully completed the task of adding the first song to the queue.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) next to the current search term \\'Through the Storm\\' at the top of the screen. The icon is located at approximately [88, 938]. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing me to input the next song title, \\'Hidden Paths\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'x\\' icon successfully cleared the search field. The previous search term \\'Through the Storm\\' is no longer present, and the search field now displays \\'Search\\'. The main content area shows \\'No results\\'. This action was successful and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the search interface for the next song.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field, which currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. The search field is located at approximately [88, 234]. This action is expected to activate the search field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to input the song title \\'Hidden Paths\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field at [88, 234] was successful. The search field is now active, indicated by the cursor, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen. This prepares the interface for inputting the next song title, \\'Hidden Paths\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Hidden Paths\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Hidden Paths\\\\n\\' into the focused search field. The search field currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'Hidden Paths\\' and the newline character will initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for the song \\'Hidden Paths\\' and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Hidden Paths\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and \\'Hidden Paths\\' is now visible in the search results. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the song to the queue.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located to the right of the song \\'Hidden Paths\\'. The icon is within the bounding box [243, 884, 294, 993]. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playing queue\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon next to \\'Hidden Paths\\' successfully opened a context menu. This menu provides several actions related to the song, including the desired \\'Add to playing queue\\' option. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the necessary option to add the song to the queue is now accessible.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 13: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) next to the current search term \\'Through the Storm\\' at the top of the screen. The icon is located at approximately [88, 938]. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing me to input the next song title, \\'Hidden Paths\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'x\\' icon successfully cleared the search field. The previous search term \\'Through the Storm\\' is no longer present, and the search field now displays \\'Search\\'. The main content area shows \\'No results\\'. This action was successful and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the search interface for the next song.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field, which currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. The search field is located at approximately [88, 234]. This action is expected to activate the search field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to input the song title \\'Hidden Paths\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field at [88, 234] was successful. The search field is now active, indicated by the cursor, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen. This prepares the interface for inputting the next song title, \\'Hidden Paths\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Hidden Paths\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Hidden Paths\\\\n\\' into the focused search field. The search field currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'Hidden Paths\\' and the newline character will initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for the song \\'Hidden Paths\\' and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Hidden Paths\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and \\'Hidden Paths\\' is now visible in the search results. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the song to the queue.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located to the right of the song \\'Hidden Paths\\'. The icon is within the bounding box [243, 884, 294, 993]. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playing queue\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon next to \\'Hidden Paths\\' successfully opened a context menu. This menu provides several actions related to the song, including the desired \\'Add to playing queue\\' option. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the necessary option to add the song to the queue is now accessible.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[385,758],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playing queue\\' option in the context menu. The option is located at approximately [385, 758]. This action is expected to add the song \\'Hidden Paths\\' to the playing queue. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playing queue\\' for the song \\'Hidden Paths\\' was executed. As a result, the context menu disappeared. The screen reverted to the search results view, still showing \\'Hidden Paths\\' as the searched item and a \\'Keyboard\\' button, indicating the search UI is active. The mini-player at the bottom continues to display \\'Through the Storm - Liam\\'.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) next to the current search term \\'Through the Storm\\' at the top of the screen. The icon is located at approximately [88, 938]. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing me to input the next song title, \\'Hidden Paths\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'x\\' icon successfully cleared the search field. The previous search term \\'Through the Storm\\' is no longer present, and the search field now displays \\'Search\\'. The main content area shows \\'No results\\'. This action was successful and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the search interface for the next song.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field, which currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. The search field is located at approximately [88, 234]. This action is expected to activate the search field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to input the song title \\'Hidden Paths\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field at [88, 234] was successful. The search field is now active, indicated by the cursor, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen. This prepares the interface for inputting the next song title, \\'Hidden Paths\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Hidden Paths\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Hidden Paths\\\\n\\' into the focused search field. The search field currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'Hidden Paths\\' and the newline character will initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for the song \\'Hidden Paths\\' and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Hidden Paths\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and \\'Hidden Paths\\' is now visible in the search results. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the song to the queue.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located to the right of the song \\'Hidden Paths\\'. The icon is within the bounding box [243, 884, 294, 993]. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playing queue\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon next to \\'Hidden Paths\\' successfully opened a context menu. This menu provides several actions related to the song, including the desired \\'Add to playing queue\\' option. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the necessary option to add the song to the queue is now accessible.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[385,758],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playing queue\\' option in the context menu. The option is located at approximately [385, 758]. This action is expected to add the song \\'Hidden Paths\\' to the playing queue. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playing queue\\' for the song \\'Hidden Paths\\' was executed. As a result, the context menu disappeared. The screen reverted to the search results view, still showing \\'Hidden Paths\\' as the searched item and a \\'Keyboard\\' button, indicating the search UI is active. The mini-player at the bottom continues to display \\'Through the Storm - Liam\\'. Assuming \\'Hidden Paths\\' was successfully added to the playing queue (to play after \\'Through the Storm\\'), this action successfully completed the primary task of Subgoal 3.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 14: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) located at the right end of the search bar, which currently displays \\'Hidden Paths\\'. The icon is located at approximately [88, 938]. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing me to input the next song title, \\'Forever Young\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Retro Music app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Retro Music app is open and its main interface is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The search field is located at approximately [88, 234]. This action is expected to activate the search field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to input the song title \\'Hidden Paths\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field at [88, 234] was successful. The search field is now active, indicated by the cursor, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen. This prepares the interface for inputting the next song title, \\'Hidden Paths\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Hidden Paths\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Hidden Paths\\\\n\\' into the focused search field. The search field currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'Hidden Paths\\' and the newline character will initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for the song \\'Hidden Paths\\' and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Hidden Paths\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and \\'Hidden Paths\\' is now visible in the search results. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the song to the queue.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located to the right of the song \\'Hidden Paths\\'. The icon is within the bounding box [243, 884, 294, 993]. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playing queue\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon next to \\'Hidden Paths\\' successfully opened a context menu. This menu provides several actions related to the song, including the desired \\'Add to playing queue\\' option. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the necessary option to add the song to the queue is now accessible.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[385,758],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playing queue\\' option in the context menu. The option is located at approximately [385, 758]. This action is expected to add the song \\'Hidden Paths\\' to the playing queue. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playing queue\\' for the song \\'Hidden Paths\\' was executed. As a result, the context menu disappeared. The screen reverted to the search results view, still showing \\'Hidden Paths\\' as the searched item and a \\'Keyboard\\' button, indicating the search UI is active. The mini-player at the bottom continues to display \\'Through the Storm - Liam\\'. Assuming \\'Hidden Paths\\' was successfully added to the playing queue (to play after \\'Through the Storm\\'), this action successfully completed the primary task of Subgoal 3.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) located at the right end of the search bar, which currently displays \\'Hidden Paths\\'. The icon is located at approximately [88, 938]. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing me to input the next song title, \\'Forever Young\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'x\\' icon successfully cleared the search field. The previous search term \\'Hidden Paths\\' is no longer present, and the search field now displays \\'Search\\'. The main content area shows \\'No results\\'. This action was successful and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the search interface for the next song.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.45\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [80, 171, 97, 298], \\'text\\': \\'Search\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [144, 48, 168, 172], \\'text\\': \\'Songs\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [147, 268, 163, 391], \\'text\\': \\'Artists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [146, 490, 163, 630], \\'text\\': \\'Albums\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [145, 729, 163, 952], \\'text\\': \\'Album artist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [505, 386, 526, 622], \\'text\\': \\'No results\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [765, 697, 793, 917], \\'text\\': \\'Keyboard\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [848, 171, 867, 565], \\'text\\': \\'Through the Storm Liam\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [920, 867, 941, 927], \\'text\\': \\'=\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [945, 251, 961, 350], \\'text\\': \\'Songs\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 444, 179, 669]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 222, 179, 432]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 681, 179, 990]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 8, 180, 210]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [746, 567, 809, 964]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [899, 210, 969, 386]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [904, 51, 960, 151]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [908, 841, 956, 960]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 902, 110, 982]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [898, 364, 1000, 634]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 816, 42, 948]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 194, 38, 244]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [905, 642, 963, 761]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [833, 34, 881, 141]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nAdd the following songs, in order, Through the Storm, Hidden Paths, Forever Young, Whispers of the Past, Heartbeat Away to my playing queue in Retro music.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field, which currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. The search field is located at approximately [88, 234]. This action is expected to activate the search field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to input the song title \\'Hidden Paths\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field at [88, 234] was successful. The search field is now active, indicated by the cursor, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen. This prepares the interface for inputting the next song title, \\'Hidden Paths\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Hidden Paths\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Hidden Paths\\\\n\\' into the focused search field. The search field currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'Hidden Paths\\' and the newline character will initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for the song \\'Hidden Paths\\' and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Hidden Paths\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and \\'Hidden Paths\\' is now visible in the search results. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the song to the queue.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located to the right of the song \\'Hidden Paths\\'. The icon is within the bounding box [243, 884, 294, 993]. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playing queue\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon next to \\'Hidden Paths\\' successfully opened a context menu. This menu provides several actions related to the song, including the desired \\'Add to playing queue\\' option. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the necessary option to add the song to the queue is now accessible.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[385,758],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playing queue\\' option in the context menu. The option is located at approximately [385, 758]. This action is expected to add the song \\'Hidden Paths\\' to the playing queue. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playing queue\\' for the song \\'Hidden Paths\\' was executed. As a result, the context menu disappeared. The screen reverted to the search results view, still showing \\'Hidden Paths\\' as the searched item and a \\'Keyboard\\' button, indicating the search UI is active. The mini-player at the bottom continues to display \\'Through the Storm - Liam\\'. Assuming \\'Hidden Paths\\' was successfully added to the playing queue (to play after \\'Through the Storm\\'), this action successfully completed the primary task of Subgoal 3.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) located at the right end of the search bar, which currently displays \\'Hidden Paths\\'. The icon is located at approximately [88, 938]. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing me to input the next song title, \\'Forever Young\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'x\\' icon successfully cleared the search field. The previous search term \\'Hidden Paths\\' is no longer present, and the search field now displays \\'Search\\'. The main content area shows \\'No results\\'. This action was successful and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the search interface for the next song.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 15: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field, which currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. The search field is located at approximately [88, 234]. This action is expected to activate the search field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to input the song title \\'Forever Young\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Retro Music app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Retro Music app is open and its main interface is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The search field currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'Hidden Paths\\' and the newline character will initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for the song \\'Hidden Paths\\' and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Hidden Paths\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and \\'Hidden Paths\\' is now visible in the search results. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the song to the queue.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located to the right of the song \\'Hidden Paths\\'. The icon is within the bounding box [243, 884, 294, 993]. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playing queue\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon next to \\'Hidden Paths\\' successfully opened a context menu. This menu provides several actions related to the song, including the desired \\'Add to playing queue\\' option. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the necessary option to add the song to the queue is now accessible.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[385,758],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playing queue\\' option in the context menu. The option is located at approximately [385, 758]. This action is expected to add the song \\'Hidden Paths\\' to the playing queue. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playing queue\\' for the song \\'Hidden Paths\\' was executed. As a result, the context menu disappeared. The screen reverted to the search results view, still showing \\'Hidden Paths\\' as the searched item and a \\'Keyboard\\' button, indicating the search UI is active. The mini-player at the bottom continues to display \\'Through the Storm - Liam\\'. Assuming \\'Hidden Paths\\' was successfully added to the playing queue (to play after \\'Through the Storm\\'), this action successfully completed the primary task of Subgoal 3.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) located at the right end of the search bar, which currently displays \\'Hidden Paths\\'. The icon is located at approximately [88, 938]. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing me to input the next song title, \\'Forever Young\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'x\\' icon successfully cleared the search field. The previous search term \\'Hidden Paths\\' is no longer present, and the search field now displays \\'Search\\'. The main content area shows \\'No results\\'. This action was successful and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the search interface for the next song.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field, which currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. The search field is located at approximately [88, 234]. This action is expected to activate the search field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to input the song title \\'Forever Young\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field at [88, 234] was successful. The search field is now active, as indicated by the cursor, and the virtual keyboard has appeared (indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\'). This prepares the interface for inputting the song title \\'Forever Young\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.45\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [75, 168, 102, 302], \\'text\\': \\'|earch\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [144, 48, 168, 172], \\'text\\': \\'Songs\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [147, 268, 163, 391], \\'text\\': \\'Artists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [146, 490, 163, 630], \\'text\\': \\'Albums\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [145, 729, 163, 952], \\'text\\': \\'Album artist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [480, 386, 502, 622], \\'text\\': \\'No results\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [718, 696, 747, 918], \\'text\\': \\'Keyboard\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [848, 171, 867, 565], \\'text\\': \\'Through the Storm Liam\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 444, 179, 669]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 222, 179, 432]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 681, 179, 990]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 8, 179, 210]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [698, 563, 763, 966]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 902, 110, 982]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 816, 42, 948]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [833, 895, 881, 989]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 194, 38, 244]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nAdd the following songs, in order, Through the Storm, Hidden Paths, Forever Young, Whispers of the Past, Heartbeat Away to my playing queue in Retro music.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Hidden Paths\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Hidden Paths\\\\n\\' into the focused search field. The search field currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'Hidden Paths\\' and the newline character will initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for the song \\'Hidden Paths\\' and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Hidden Paths\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and \\'Hidden Paths\\' is now visible in the search results. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the song to the queue.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located to the right of the song \\'Hidden Paths\\'. The icon is within the bounding box [243, 884, 294, 993]. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playing queue\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon next to \\'Hidden Paths\\' successfully opened a context menu. This menu provides several actions related to the song, including the desired \\'Add to playing queue\\' option. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the necessary option to add the song to the queue is now accessible.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[385,758],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playing queue\\' option in the context menu. The option is located at approximately [385, 758]. This action is expected to add the song \\'Hidden Paths\\' to the playing queue. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playing queue\\' for the song \\'Hidden Paths\\' was executed. As a result, the context menu disappeared. The screen reverted to the search results view, still showing \\'Hidden Paths\\' as the searched item and a \\'Keyboard\\' button, indicating the search UI is active. The mini-player at the bottom continues to display \\'Through the Storm - Liam\\'. Assuming \\'Hidden Paths\\' was successfully added to the playing queue (to play after \\'Through the Storm\\'), this action successfully completed the primary task of Subgoal 3.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) located at the right end of the search bar, which currently displays \\'Hidden Paths\\'. The icon is located at approximately [88, 938]. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing me to input the next song title, \\'Forever Young\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'x\\' icon successfully cleared the search field. The previous search term \\'Hidden Paths\\' is no longer present, and the search field now displays \\'Search\\'. The main content area shows \\'No results\\'. This action was successful and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the search interface for the next song.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field, which currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. The search field is located at approximately [88, 234]. This action is expected to activate the search field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to input the song title \\'Forever Young\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field at [88, 234] was successful. The search field is now active, as indicated by the cursor, and the virtual keyboard has appeared (indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\'). This prepares the interface for inputting the song title \\'Forever Young\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 16: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Forever Young\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Forever Young\\\\n\\' into the active search field. The search field is currently empty and ready for input. This action will type \\'Forever Young\\' into the field, and the newline character will initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for \\'Forever Young\\' and display the results. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Retro Music app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Retro Music app is open and its main interface is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The icon is within the bounding box [243, 884, 294, 993]. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playing queue\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon next to \\'Hidden Paths\\' successfully opened a context menu. This menu provides several actions related to the song, including the desired \\'Add to playing queue\\' option. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the necessary option to add the song to the queue is now accessible.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[385,758],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playing queue\\' option in the context menu. The option is located at approximately [385, 758]. This action is expected to add the song \\'Hidden Paths\\' to the playing queue. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playing queue\\' for the song \\'Hidden Paths\\' was executed. As a result, the context menu disappeared. The screen reverted to the search results view, still showing \\'Hidden Paths\\' as the searched item and a \\'Keyboard\\' button, indicating the search UI is active. The mini-player at the bottom continues to display \\'Through the Storm - Liam\\'. Assuming \\'Hidden Paths\\' was successfully added to the playing queue (to play after \\'Through the Storm\\'), this action successfully completed the primary task of Subgoal 3.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) located at the right end of the search bar, which currently displays \\'Hidden Paths\\'. The icon is located at approximately [88, 938]. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing me to input the next song title, \\'Forever Young\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'x\\' icon successfully cleared the search field. The previous search term \\'Hidden Paths\\' is no longer present, and the search field now displays \\'Search\\'. The main content area shows \\'No results\\'. This action was successful and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the search interface for the next song.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field, which currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. The search field is located at approximately [88, 234]. This action is expected to activate the search field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to input the song title \\'Forever Young\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field at [88, 234] was successful. The search field is now active, as indicated by the cursor, and the virtual keyboard has appeared (indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\'). This prepares the interface for inputting the song title \\'Forever Young\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Forever Young\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Forever Young\\\\n\\' into the active search field. The search field is currently empty and ready for input. This action will type \\'Forever Young\\' into the field, and the newline character will initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for \\'Forever Young\\' and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Forever Young\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and \\'Forever Young\\' is now visible in the search results. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the song to the queue.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.46\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [77, 170, 102, 432], \\'text\\': \\'Forever Young\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [144, 48, 168, 172], \\'text\\': \\'Songs\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [147, 268, 163, 391], \\'text\\': \\'Artists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [146, 490, 163, 630], \\'text\\': \\'Albums\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [145, 729, 163, 952], \\'text\\': \\'Album artist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [202, 19, 214, 122], \\'text\\': \\'SONG S\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [244, 185, 266, 445], \\'text\\': \\'Forever Young\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [272, 188, 288, 289], \\'text\\': \\'Music\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [718, 696, 747, 918], \\'text\\': \\'Keyboard\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [848, 171, 867, 565], \\'text\\': \\'Through the Storm Liam\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 444, 179, 669]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 681, 179, 990]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 221, 179, 431]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 8, 179, 210]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [698, 563, 763, 966]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [74, 907, 107, 978]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [240, 33, 294, 158]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [243, 885, 293, 993]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [13, 817, 41, 949]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [833, 33, 881, 142]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 37, 243]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nAdd the following songs, in order, Through the Storm, Hidden Paths, Forever Young, Whispers of the Past, Heartbeat Away to my playing queue in Retro music.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located to the right of the song \\'Hidden Paths\\'. The icon is within the bounding box [243, 884, 294, 993]. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playing queue\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon next to \\'Hidden Paths\\' successfully opened a context menu. This menu provides several actions related to the song, including the desired \\'Add to playing queue\\' option. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the necessary option to add the song to the queue is now accessible.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[385,758],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playing queue\\' option in the context menu. The option is located at approximately [385, 758]. This action is expected to add the song \\'Hidden Paths\\' to the playing queue. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playing queue\\' for the song \\'Hidden Paths\\' was executed. As a result, the context menu disappeared. The screen reverted to the search results view, still showing \\'Hidden Paths\\' as the searched item and a \\'Keyboard\\' button, indicating the search UI is active. The mini-player at the bottom continues to display \\'Through the Storm - Liam\\'. Assuming \\'Hidden Paths\\' was successfully added to the playing queue (to play after \\'Through the Storm\\'), this action successfully completed the primary task of Subgoal 3.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) located at the right end of the search bar, which currently displays \\'Hidden Paths\\'. The icon is located at approximately [88, 938]. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing me to input the next song title, \\'Forever Young\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'x\\' icon successfully cleared the search field. The previous search term \\'Hidden Paths\\' is no longer present, and the search field now displays \\'Search\\'. The main content area shows \\'No results\\'. This action was successful and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the search interface for the next song.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field, which currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. The search field is located at approximately [88, 234]. This action is expected to activate the search field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to input the song title \\'Forever Young\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field at [88, 234] was successful. The search field is now active, as indicated by the cursor, and the virtual keyboard has appeared (indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\'). This prepares the interface for inputting the song title \\'Forever Young\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Forever Young\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Forever Young\\\\n\\' into the active search field. The search field is currently empty and ready for input. This action will type \\'Forever Young\\' into the field, and the newline character will initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for \\'Forever Young\\' and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Forever Young\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and \\'Forever Young\\' is now visible in the search results. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the song to the queue.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 17: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,939],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located to the right of the song \\'Forever Young\\'. The icon is within the bounding box `[243, 885, 293, 993]`. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playing queue\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Retro Music app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Retro Music app is open and its main interface is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[385,758],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playing queue\\' option in the context menu. The option is located at approximately [385, 758]. This action is expected to add the song \\'Hidden Paths\\' to the playing queue. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playing queue\\' for the song \\'Hidden Paths\\' was executed. As a result, the context menu disappeared. The screen reverted to the search results view, still showing \\'Hidden Paths\\' as the searched item and a \\'Keyboard\\' button, indicating the search UI is active. The mini-player at the bottom continues to display \\'Through the Storm - Liam\\'. Assuming \\'Hidden Paths\\' was successfully added to the playing queue (to play after \\'Through the Storm\\'), this action successfully completed the primary task of Subgoal 3.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) located at the right end of the search bar, which currently displays \\'Hidden Paths\\'. The icon is located at approximately [88, 938]. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing me to input the next song title, \\'Forever Young\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'x\\' icon successfully cleared the search field. The previous search term \\'Hidden Paths\\' is no longer present, and the search field now displays \\'Search\\'. The main content area shows \\'No results\\'. This action was successful and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the search interface for the next song.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field, which currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. The search field is located at approximately [88, 234]. This action is expected to activate the search field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to input the song title \\'Forever Young\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field at [88, 234] was successful. The search field is now active, as indicated by the cursor, and the virtual keyboard has appeared (indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\'). This prepares the interface for inputting the song title \\'Forever Young\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Forever Young\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Forever Young\\\\n\\' into the active search field. The search field is currently empty and ready for input. This action will type \\'Forever Young\\' into the field, and the newline character will initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for \\'Forever Young\\' and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Forever Young\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and \\'Forever Young\\' is now visible in the search results. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the song to the queue.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,939],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located to the right of the song \\'Forever Young\\'. The icon is within the bounding box `[243, 885, 293, 993]`. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playing queue\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon next to \\'Forever Young\\' successfully opened a context menu. This menu provides several actions related to the song, including the desired \\'Add to playing queue\\' option. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the necessary option to add the song to the queue is now accessible.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.46\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [77, 170, 102, 432], \\'text\\': \\'Forever Young\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [144, 48, 168, 172], \\'text\\': \\'Songs\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [147, 268, 163, 391], \\'text\\': \\'Artists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [146, 490, 163, 630], \\'text\\': \\'Albums\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [145, 729, 163, 952], \\'text\\': \\'Album artist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [202, 19, 214, 122], \\'text\\': \\'SONG S\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [244, 185, 266, 445], \\'text\\': \\'Forever Young\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [272, 188, 288, 289], \\'text\\': \\'Music\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [320, 558, 342, 735], \\'text\\': \\'Play next\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [373, 561, 397, 955], \\'text\\': \\'Add to playing queue\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [425, 562, 448, 833], \\'text\\': \\'Add to playlist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [478, 561, 496, 787], \\'text\\': \\'Go to album\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [531, 561, 548, 775], \\'text\\': \\'Go to artist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [583, 559, 601, 671], \\'text\\': \\'Share\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [635, 560, 658, 753], \\'text\\': \\'Tag editor\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [688, 561, 706, 693], \\'text\\': \\'Details\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [740, 558, 762, 844], \\'text\\': \\'Set as ringtone\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [793, 563, 811, 854], \\'text\\': \\'Add to Blacklist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [846, 171, 867, 910], \\'text\\': \\'Through the Storm Lic Delete from device\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 444, 179, 669]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 681, 179, 991]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 221, 179, 431]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 8, 179, 210]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [73, 905, 108, 980]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [777, 529, 829, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [244, 896, 288, 986]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 194, 38, 243]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [13, 815, 41, 951]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [460, 540, 515, 1000]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[385,758],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playing queue\\' option in the context menu. The option is located at approximately [385, 758]. This action is expected to add the song \\'Hidden Paths\\' to the playing queue. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playing queue\\' for the song \\'Hidden Paths\\' was executed. As a result, the context menu disappeared. The screen reverted to the search results view, still showing \\'Hidden Paths\\' as the searched item and a \\'Keyboard\\' button, indicating the search UI is active. The mini-player at the bottom continues to display \\'Through the Storm - Liam\\'. Assuming \\'Hidden Paths\\' was successfully added to the playing queue (to play after \\'Through the Storm\\'), this action successfully completed the primary task of Subgoal 3.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) located at the right end of the search bar, which currently displays \\'Hidden Paths\\'. The icon is located at approximately [88, 938]. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing me to input the next song title, \\'Forever Young\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'x\\' icon successfully cleared the search field. The previous search term \\'Hidden Paths\\' is no longer present, and the search field now displays \\'Search\\'. The main content area shows \\'No results\\'. This action was successful and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the search interface for the next song.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field, which currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. The search field is located at approximately [88, 234]. This action is expected to activate the search field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to input the song title \\'Forever Young\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field at [88, 234] was successful. The search field is now active, as indicated by the cursor, and the virtual keyboard has appeared (indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\'). This prepares the interface for inputting the song title \\'Forever Young\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Forever Young\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Forever Young\\\\n\\' into the active search field. The search field is currently empty and ready for input. This action will type \\'Forever Young\\' into the field, and the newline character will initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for \\'Forever Young\\' and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Forever Young\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and \\'Forever Young\\' is now visible in the search results. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the song to the queue.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,939],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located to the right of the song \\'Forever Young\\'. The icon is within the bounding box `[243, 885, 293, 993]`. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playing queue\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon next to \\'Forever Young\\' successfully opened a context menu. This menu provides several actions related to the song, including the desired \\'Add to playing queue\\' option. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the necessary option to add the song to the queue is now accessible.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 18: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[385,758],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playing queue\\' option in the context menu. The option is located at approximately `[385, 758]`. This action is expected to add the song \\'Forever Young\\' to the playing queue. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Retro Music app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Retro Music app is open and its main interface is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) located at the right end of the search bar, which currently displays \\'Hidden Paths\\'. The icon is located at approximately [88, 938]. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing me to input the next song title, \\'Forever Young\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'x\\' icon successfully cleared the search field. The previous search term \\'Hidden Paths\\' is no longer present, and the search field now displays \\'Search\\'. The main content area shows \\'No results\\'. This action was successful and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the search interface for the next song.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field, which currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. The search field is located at approximately [88, 234]. This action is expected to activate the search field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to input the song title \\'Forever Young\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field at [88, 234] was successful. The search field is now active, as indicated by the cursor, and the virtual keyboard has appeared (indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\'). This prepares the interface for inputting the song title \\'Forever Young\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Forever Young\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Forever Young\\\\n\\' into the active search field. The search field is currently empty and ready for input. This action will type \\'Forever Young\\' into the field, and the newline character will initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for \\'Forever Young\\' and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Forever Young\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and \\'Forever Young\\' is now visible in the search results. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the song to the queue.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,939],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located to the right of the song \\'Forever Young\\'. The icon is within the bounding box `[243, 885, 293, 993]`. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playing queue\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon next to \\'Forever Young\\' successfully opened a context menu. This menu provides several actions related to the song, including the desired \\'Add to playing queue\\' option. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the necessary option to add the song to the queue is now accessible.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[385,758],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playing queue\\' option in the context menu. The option is located at approximately `[385, 758]`. This action is expected to add the song \\'Forever Young\\' to the playing queue. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playing queue\\' for the song \\'Forever Young\\' was successful. The context menu closed, and the screen returned to the search results view, still showing \\'Forever Young\\'. This action successfully completed the primary task of Subgoal 4, which was to add \\'Forever Young\\' to the playing queue.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.47\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [77, 170, 102, 432], \\'text\\': \\'Forever Young\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [144, 48, 168, 172], \\'text\\': \\'Songs\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [147, 268, 163, 391], \\'text\\': \\'Artists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [146, 490, 163, 630], \\'text\\': \\'Albums\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [145, 729, 163, 952], \\'text\\': \\'Album artist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [202, 19, 214, 122], \\'text\\': \\'SONG S\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [244, 185, 266, 445], \\'text\\': \\'Forever Young\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [272, 188, 288, 289], \\'text\\': \\'Music\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [765, 697, 793, 917], \\'text\\': \\'Keyboard\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [848, 171, 867, 565], \\'text\\': \\'Through the Storm Liam\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [920, 867, 941, 927], \\'text\\': \\'=\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [945, 251, 961, 350], \\'text\\': \\'Songs\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 444, 179, 669]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 681, 179, 990]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 222, 179, 431]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 8, 179, 210]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [746, 567, 809, 964]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [899, 210, 970, 387]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [908, 840, 956, 961]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [905, 49, 959, 150]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [242, 883, 294, 995]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [74, 907, 108, 978]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [240, 33, 294, 158]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 37, 243]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [900, 629, 984, 772]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) located at the right end of the search bar, which currently displays \\'Hidden Paths\\'. The icon is located at approximately [88, 938]. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing me to input the next song title, \\'Forever Young\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'x\\' icon successfully cleared the search field. The previous search term \\'Hidden Paths\\' is no longer present, and the search field now displays \\'Search\\'. The main content area shows \\'No results\\'. This action was successful and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the search interface for the next song.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field, which currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. The search field is located at approximately [88, 234]. This action is expected to activate the search field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to input the song title \\'Forever Young\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field at [88, 234] was successful. The search field is now active, as indicated by the cursor, and the virtual keyboard has appeared (indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\'). This prepares the interface for inputting the song title \\'Forever Young\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Forever Young\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Forever Young\\\\n\\' into the active search field. The search field is currently empty and ready for input. This action will type \\'Forever Young\\' into the field, and the newline character will initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for \\'Forever Young\\' and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Forever Young\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and \\'Forever Young\\' is now visible in the search results. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the song to the queue.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,939],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located to the right of the song \\'Forever Young\\'. The icon is within the bounding box `[243, 885, 293, 993]`. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playing queue\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon next to \\'Forever Young\\' successfully opened a context menu. This menu provides several actions related to the song, including the desired \\'Add to playing queue\\' option. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the necessary option to add the song to the queue is now accessible.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[385,758],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playing queue\\' option in the context menu. The option is located at approximately `[385, 758]`. This action is expected to add the song \\'Forever Young\\' to the playing queue. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playing queue\\' for the song \\'Forever Young\\' was successful. The context menu closed, and the screen returned to the search results view, still showing \\'Forever Young\\'. This action successfully completed the primary task of Subgoal 4, which was to add \\'Forever Young\\' to the playing queue.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 19: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) located at the right end of the search bar, which currently displays \\'Forever Young\\'. The icon is located at approximately [88, 938]. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing me to input the next song title, \\'Whispers of the Past\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Retro Music app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Retro Music app is open and its main interface is visible.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field, which currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. The search field is located at approximately [88, 234]. This action is expected to activate the search field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to input the song title \\'Forever Young\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field at [88, 234] was successful. The search field is now active, as indicated by the cursor, and the virtual keyboard has appeared (indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\'). This prepares the interface for inputting the song title \\'Forever Young\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Forever Young\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Forever Young\\\\n\\' into the active search field. The search field is currently empty and ready for input. This action will type \\'Forever Young\\' into the field, and the newline character will initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for \\'Forever Young\\' and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Forever Young\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and \\'Forever Young\\' is now visible in the search results. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the song to the queue.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,939],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located to the right of the song \\'Forever Young\\'. The icon is within the bounding box `[243, 885, 293, 993]`. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playing queue\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon next to \\'Forever Young\\' successfully opened a context menu. This menu provides several actions related to the song, including the desired \\'Add to playing queue\\' option. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the necessary option to add the song to the queue is now accessible.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[385,758],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playing queue\\' option in the context menu. The option is located at approximately `[385, 758]`. This action is expected to add the song \\'Forever Young\\' to the playing queue. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playing queue\\' for the song \\'Forever Young\\' was successful. The context menu closed, and the screen returned to the search results view, still showing \\'Forever Young\\'. This action successfully completed the primary task of Subgoal 4, which was to add \\'Forever Young\\' to the playing queue.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) located at the right end of the search bar, which currently displays \\'Forever Young\\'. The icon is located at approximately [88, 938]. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing me to input the next song title, \\'Whispers of the Past\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) next to the search term \\'Forever Young\\' was successful. The search field was cleared, and it now displays \\'Search\\'. The song list area below now shows \\'No results\\'. This action successfully prepared the interface for searching the next song, \\'Whispers of the Past\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.47\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [80, 171, 97, 298], \\'text\\': \\'Search\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [144, 48, 168, 172], \\'text\\': \\'Songs\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [147, 268, 163, 391], \\'text\\': \\'Artists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [146, 490, 163, 630], \\'text\\': \\'Albums\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [145, 729, 163, 952], \\'text\\': \\'Album artist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [505, 386, 526, 622], \\'text\\': \\'No results\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [765, 697, 793, 917], \\'text\\': \\'Keyboard\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [848, 171, 867, 565], \\'text\\': \\'Through the Storm Liam\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [920, 867, 941, 927], \\'text\\': \\'=\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [945, 251, 961, 350], \\'text\\': \\'Songs\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 444, 179, 669]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 222, 179, 432]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 681, 179, 990]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 8, 180, 210]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [746, 567, 809, 964]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [899, 210, 969, 386]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [904, 51, 960, 151]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [908, 841, 956, 960]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 902, 110, 982]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [898, 364, 1000, 634]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 194, 38, 244]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [905, 642, 963, 761]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 815, 40, 946]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [833, 34, 881, 141]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field, which currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. The search field is located at approximately [88, 234]. This action is expected to activate the search field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to input the song title \\'Forever Young\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field at [88, 234] was successful. The search field is now active, as indicated by the cursor, and the virtual keyboard has appeared (indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\'). This prepares the interface for inputting the song title \\'Forever Young\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Forever Young\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Forever Young\\\\n\\' into the active search field. The search field is currently empty and ready for input. This action will type \\'Forever Young\\' into the field, and the newline character will initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for \\'Forever Young\\' and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Forever Young\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and \\'Forever Young\\' is now visible in the search results. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the song to the queue.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,939],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located to the right of the song \\'Forever Young\\'. The icon is within the bounding box `[243, 885, 293, 993]`. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playing queue\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon next to \\'Forever Young\\' successfully opened a context menu. This menu provides several actions related to the song, including the desired \\'Add to playing queue\\' option. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the necessary option to add the song to the queue is now accessible.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[385,758],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playing queue\\' option in the context menu. The option is located at approximately `[385, 758]`. This action is expected to add the song \\'Forever Young\\' to the playing queue. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playing queue\\' for the song \\'Forever Young\\' was successful. The context menu closed, and the screen returned to the search results view, still showing \\'Forever Young\\'. This action successfully completed the primary task of Subgoal 4, which was to add \\'Forever Young\\' to the playing queue.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) located at the right end of the search bar, which currently displays \\'Forever Young\\'. The icon is located at approximately [88, 938]. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing me to input the next song title, \\'Whispers of the Past\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) next to the search term \\'Forever Young\\' was successful. The search field was cleared, and it now displays \\'Search\\'. The song list area below now shows \\'No results\\'. This action successfully prepared the interface for searching the next song, \\'Whispers of the Past\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 20: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field, which currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. The search field is located at approximately [88, 234]. This action is expected to activate the search field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to input the song title \\'Whispers of the Past\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Retro Music app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Retro Music app is open and its main interface is visible.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The search field is currently empty and ready for input. This action will type \\'Forever Young\\' into the field, and the newline character will initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for \\'Forever Young\\' and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Forever Young\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and \\'Forever Young\\' is now visible in the search results. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the song to the queue.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,939],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located to the right of the song \\'Forever Young\\'. The icon is within the bounding box `[243, 885, 293, 993]`. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playing queue\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon next to \\'Forever Young\\' successfully opened a context menu. This menu provides several actions related to the song, including the desired \\'Add to playing queue\\' option. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the necessary option to add the song to the queue is now accessible.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[385,758],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playing queue\\' option in the context menu. The option is located at approximately `[385, 758]`. This action is expected to add the song \\'Forever Young\\' to the playing queue. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playing queue\\' for the song \\'Forever Young\\' was successful. The context menu closed, and the screen returned to the search results view, still showing \\'Forever Young\\'. This action successfully completed the primary task of Subgoal 4, which was to add \\'Forever Young\\' to the playing queue.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) located at the right end of the search bar, which currently displays \\'Forever Young\\'. The icon is located at approximately [88, 938]. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing me to input the next song title, \\'Whispers of the Past\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) next to the search term \\'Forever Young\\' was successful. The search field was cleared, and it now displays \\'Search\\'. The song list area below now shows \\'No results\\'. This action successfully prepared the interface for searching the next song, \\'Whispers of the Past\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field, which currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. The search field is located at approximately [88, 234]. This action is expected to activate the search field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to input the song title \\'Whispers of the Past\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field at [88, 234] was successful. The search field is now active, and the virtual keyboard has appeared (indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' at the bottom of the screen). This prepares the interface for inputting the song title \\'Whispers of the Past\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.48\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [75, 168, 102, 302], \\'text\\': \\'|earch\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [144, 48, 168, 172], \\'text\\': \\'Songs\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [147, 268, 163, 391], \\'text\\': \\'Artists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [146, 490, 163, 630], \\'text\\': \\'Albums\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [145, 729, 163, 952], \\'text\\': \\'Album artist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [480, 386, 502, 622], \\'text\\': \\'No results\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [718, 696, 747, 918], \\'text\\': \\'Keyboard\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [848, 171, 867, 565], \\'text\\': \\'Through the Storm Liam\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 444, 179, 669]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 222, 179, 432]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 681, 179, 990]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 8, 179, 210]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [698, 563, 763, 966]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 902, 110, 982]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 816, 42, 948]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [833, 895, 881, 989]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 194, 38, 243]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The search field is currently empty and ready for input. This action will type \\'Forever Young\\' into the field, and the newline character will initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for \\'Forever Young\\' and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Forever Young\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and \\'Forever Young\\' is now visible in the search results. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the song to the queue.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,939],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located to the right of the song \\'Forever Young\\'. The icon is within the bounding box `[243, 885, 293, 993]`. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playing queue\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon next to \\'Forever Young\\' successfully opened a context menu. This menu provides several actions related to the song, including the desired \\'Add to playing queue\\' option. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the necessary option to add the song to the queue is now accessible.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[385,758],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playing queue\\' option in the context menu. The option is located at approximately `[385, 758]`. This action is expected to add the song \\'Forever Young\\' to the playing queue. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playing queue\\' for the song \\'Forever Young\\' was successful. The context menu closed, and the screen returned to the search results view, still showing \\'Forever Young\\'. This action successfully completed the primary task of Subgoal 4, which was to add \\'Forever Young\\' to the playing queue.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) located at the right end of the search bar, which currently displays \\'Forever Young\\'. The icon is located at approximately [88, 938]. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing me to input the next song title, \\'Whispers of the Past\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) next to the search term \\'Forever Young\\' was successful. The search field was cleared, and it now displays \\'Search\\'. The song list area below now shows \\'No results\\'. This action successfully prepared the interface for searching the next song, \\'Whispers of the Past\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field, which currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. The search field is located at approximately [88, 234]. This action is expected to activate the search field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to input the song title \\'Whispers of the Past\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field at [88, 234] was successful. The search field is now active, and the virtual keyboard has appeared (indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' at the bottom of the screen). This prepares the interface for inputting the song title \\'Whispers of the Past\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 21: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Whispers of the Past\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Whispers of the Past\\n\\' into the active search field. The search field is currently empty and ready for input. This action will type \\'Whispers of the Past\\' into the field, and the newline character will initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for \\'Whispers of the Past\\' and display the results. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Retro Music app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Retro Music app is open and its main interface is visible.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,939],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located to the right of the song \\'Forever Young\\'. The icon is within the bounding box `[243, 885, 293, 993]`. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playing queue\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon next to \\'Forever Young\\' successfully opened a context menu. This menu provides several actions related to the song, including the desired \\'Add to playing queue\\' option. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the necessary option to add the song to the queue is now accessible.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[385,758],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playing queue\\' option in the context menu. The option is located at approximately `[385, 758]`. This action is expected to add the song \\'Forever Young\\' to the playing queue. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playing queue\\' for the song \\'Forever Young\\' was successful. The context menu closed, and the screen returned to the search results view, still showing \\'Forever Young\\'. This action successfully completed the primary task of Subgoal 4, which was to add \\'Forever Young\\' to the playing queue.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) located at the right end of the search bar, which currently displays \\'Forever Young\\'. The icon is located at approximately [88, 938]. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing me to input the next song title, \\'Whispers of the Past\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) next to the search term \\'Forever Young\\' was successful. The search field was cleared, and it now displays \\'Search\\'. The song list area below now shows \\'No results\\'. This action successfully prepared the interface for searching the next song, \\'Whispers of the Past\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field, which currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. The search field is located at approximately [88, 234]. This action is expected to activate the search field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to input the song title \\'Whispers of the Past\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field at [88, 234] was successful. The search field is now active, and the virtual keyboard has appeared (indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' at the bottom of the screen). This prepares the interface for inputting the song title \\'Whispers of the Past\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Whispers of the Past\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Whispers of the Past\\n\\' into the active search field. The search field is currently empty and ready for input. This action will type \\'Whispers of the Past\\' into the field, and the newline character will initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for \\'Whispers of the Past\\' and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Whispers of the Past\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and \\'Whispers of the Past\\' is now visible in the search results. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the song to the queue.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.49\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [78, 170, 103, 547], \\'text\\': \\'Whispers of the Past\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [144, 48, 168, 172], \\'text\\': \\'Songs\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [147, 268, 163, 391], \\'text\\': \\'Artists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [146, 490, 163, 630], \\'text\\': \\'Albums\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [145, 729, 163, 952], \\'text\\': \\'Album artist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [202, 19, 214, 122], \\'text\\': \\'SONG S\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [242, 185, 288, 562], \\'text\\': \\'Whispers of the Past Music\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [718, 696, 747, 918], \\'text\\': \\'Keyboard\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [848, 171, 867, 565], \\'text\\': \\'Through the Storm Liam\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 444, 179, 669]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 681, 179, 990]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 222, 179, 431]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 8, 179, 210]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [698, 563, 763, 966]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [74, 908, 107, 977]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [243, 885, 293, 993]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [833, 33, 881, 142]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 37, 243]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 817, 40, 949]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [240, 35, 294, 158]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [833, 895, 881, 987]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [899, 216, 949, 382]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,939],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located to the right of the song \\'Forever Young\\'. The icon is within the bounding box `[243, 885, 293, 993]`. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playing queue\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon next to \\'Forever Young\\' successfully opened a context menu. This menu provides several actions related to the song, including the desired \\'Add to playing queue\\' option. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the necessary option to add the song to the queue is now accessible.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[385,758],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playing queue\\' option in the context menu. The option is located at approximately `[385, 758]`. This action is expected to add the song \\'Forever Young\\' to the playing queue. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playing queue\\' for the song \\'Forever Young\\' was successful. The context menu closed, and the screen returned to the search results view, still showing \\'Forever Young\\'. This action successfully completed the primary task of Subgoal 4, which was to add \\'Forever Young\\' to the playing queue.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) located at the right end of the search bar, which currently displays \\'Forever Young\\'. The icon is located at approximately [88, 938]. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing me to input the next song title, \\'Whispers of the Past\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) next to the search term \\'Forever Young\\' was successful. The search field was cleared, and it now displays \\'Search\\'. The song list area below now shows \\'No results\\'. This action successfully prepared the interface for searching the next song, \\'Whispers of the Past\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field, which currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. The search field is located at approximately [88, 234]. This action is expected to activate the search field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to input the song title \\'Whispers of the Past\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field at [88, 234] was successful. The search field is now active, and the virtual keyboard has appeared (indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' at the bottom of the screen). This prepares the interface for inputting the song title \\'Whispers of the Past\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Whispers of the Past\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Whispers of the Past\\n\\' into the active search field. The search field is currently empty and ready for input. This action will type \\'Whispers of the Past\\' into the field, and the newline character will initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for \\'Whispers of the Past\\' and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Whispers of the Past\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and \\'Whispers of the Past\\' is now visible in the search results. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the song to the queue.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 22: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,939],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located to the right of the song \\'Whispers of the Past\\'. The icon is within the bounding box `[243, 885, 293, 993]`. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playing queue\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Retro Music app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Retro Music app is open and its main interface is visible.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[385,758],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playing queue\\' option in the context menu. The option is located at approximately `[385, 758]`. This action is expected to add the song \\'Forever Young\\' to the playing queue. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playing queue\\' for the song \\'Forever Young\\' was successful. The context menu closed, and the screen returned to the search results view, still showing \\'Forever Young\\'. This action successfully completed the primary task of Subgoal 4, which was to add \\'Forever Young\\' to the playing queue.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) located at the right end of the search bar, which currently displays \\'Forever Young\\'. The icon is located at approximately [88, 938]. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing me to input the next song title, \\'Whispers of the Past\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) next to the search term \\'Forever Young\\' was successful. The search field was cleared, and it now displays \\'Search\\'. The song list area below now shows \\'No results\\'. This action successfully prepared the interface for searching the next song, \\'Whispers of the Past\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field, which currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. The search field is located at approximately [88, 234]. This action is expected to activate the search field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to input the song title \\'Whispers of the Past\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field at [88, 234] was successful. The search field is now active, and the virtual keyboard has appeared (indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' at the bottom of the screen). This prepares the interface for inputting the song title \\'Whispers of the Past\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Whispers of the Past\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Whispers of the Past\\n\\' into the active search field. The search field is currently empty and ready for input. This action will type \\'Whispers of the Past\\' into the field, and the newline character will initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for \\'Whispers of the Past\\' and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Whispers of the Past\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and \\'Whispers of the Past\\' is now visible in the search results. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the song to the queue.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,939],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located to the right of the song \\'Whispers of the Past\\'. The icon is within the bounding box `[243, 885, 293, 993]`. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playing queue\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon next to \\'Whispers of the Past\\' was successful. A context menu appeared, displaying various options for the song, including \\'Add to playing queue\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the necessary option to add the song to the queue is now accessible.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.49\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [78, 170, 103, 547], \\'text\\': \\'Whispers of the Past\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [144, 48, 168, 172], \\'text\\': \\'Songs\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [147, 268, 163, 391], \\'text\\': \\'Artists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [146, 490, 163, 630], \\'text\\': \\'Albums\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [145, 729, 163, 952], \\'text\\': \\'Album artist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [202, 19, 214, 122], \\'text\\': \\'SONG S\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [242, 185, 288, 562], \\'text\\': \\'Whispers of the Past Music\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [320, 558, 342, 735], \\'text\\': \\'Play next\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [373, 561, 397, 955], \\'text\\': \\'Add to playing queue\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [425, 562, 448, 833], \\'text\\': \\'Add to playlist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [478, 561, 496, 787], \\'text\\': \\'Go to album\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [531, 561, 548, 775], \\'text\\': \\'Go to artist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [583, 559, 601, 671], \\'text\\': \\'Share\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [635, 560, 658, 753], \\'text\\': \\'Tag editor\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [688, 561, 706, 693], \\'text\\': \\'Details\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [740, 558, 762, 844], \\'text\\': \\'Set as ringtone\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [793, 563, 811, 854], \\'text\\': \\'Add to Blacklist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [846, 171, 867, 910], \\'text\\': \\'Through the Storm Lic Delete from device\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 444, 179, 669]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 681, 179, 990]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 222, 179, 431]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 8, 179, 210]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 905, 109, 980]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [245, 898, 287, 985]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [777, 529, 829, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 194, 38, 243]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [13, 815, 42, 951]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [460, 539, 515, 1000]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[385,758],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playing queue\\' option in the context menu. The option is located at approximately `[385, 758]`. This action is expected to add the song \\'Forever Young\\' to the playing queue. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playing queue\\' for the song \\'Forever Young\\' was successful. The context menu closed, and the screen returned to the search results view, still showing \\'Forever Young\\'. This action successfully completed the primary task of Subgoal 4, which was to add \\'Forever Young\\' to the playing queue.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) located at the right end of the search bar, which currently displays \\'Forever Young\\'. The icon is located at approximately [88, 938]. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing me to input the next song title, \\'Whispers of the Past\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) next to the search term \\'Forever Young\\' was successful. The search field was cleared, and it now displays \\'Search\\'. The song list area below now shows \\'No results\\'. This action successfully prepared the interface for searching the next song, \\'Whispers of the Past\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field, which currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. The search field is located at approximately [88, 234]. This action is expected to activate the search field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to input the song title \\'Whispers of the Past\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field at [88, 234] was successful. The search field is now active, and the virtual keyboard has appeared (indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' at the bottom of the screen). This prepares the interface for inputting the song title \\'Whispers of the Past\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Whispers of the Past\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Whispers of the Past\\n\\' into the active search field. The search field is currently empty and ready for input. This action will type \\'Whispers of the Past\\' into the field, and the newline character will initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for \\'Whispers of the Past\\' and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Whispers of the Past\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and \\'Whispers of the Past\\' is now visible in the search results. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the song to the queue.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,939],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located to the right of the song \\'Whispers of the Past\\'. The icon is within the bounding box `[243, 885, 293, 993]`. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playing queue\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon next to \\'Whispers of the Past\\' was successful. A context menu appeared, displaying various options for the song, including \\'Add to playing queue\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the necessary option to add the song to the queue is now accessible.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 23: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[385,758],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playing queue\\' option in the context menu. The option is located at approximately `[385, 758]`. This action is expected to add the song \\'Whispers of the Past\\' to the playing queue. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Retro Music app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Retro Music app is open and its main interface is visible.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) located at the right end of the search bar, which currently displays \\'Forever Young\\'. The icon is located at approximately [88, 938]. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing me to input the next song title, \\'Whispers of the Past\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) next to the search term \\'Forever Young\\' was successful. The search field was cleared, and it now displays \\'Search\\'. The song list area below now shows \\'No results\\'. This action successfully prepared the interface for searching the next song, \\'Whispers of the Past\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field, which currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. The search field is located at approximately [88, 234]. This action is expected to activate the search field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to input the song title \\'Whispers of the Past\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field at [88, 234] was successful. The search field is now active, and the virtual keyboard has appeared (indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' at the bottom of the screen). This prepares the interface for inputting the song title \\'Whispers of the Past\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Whispers of the Past\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Whispers of the Past\\n\\' into the active search field. The search field is currently empty and ready for input. This action will type \\'Whispers of the Past\\' into the field, and the newline character will initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for \\'Whispers of the Past\\' and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Whispers of the Past\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and \\'Whispers of the Past\\' is now visible in the search results. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the song to the queue.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,939],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located to the right of the song \\'Whispers of the Past\\'. The icon is within the bounding box `[243, 885, 293, 993]`. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playing queue\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon next to \\'Whispers of the Past\\' was successful. A context menu appeared, displaying various options for the song, including \\'Add to playing queue\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the necessary option to add the song to the queue is now accessible.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[385,758],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playing queue\\' option in the context menu. The option is located at approximately `[385, 758]`. This action is expected to add the song \\'Whispers of the Past\\' to the playing queue. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playing queue\\' for the song \\'Whispers of the Past\\' was successful. The context menu closed, and the screen returned to the view showing \\'Whispers of the Past\\'. This action successfully added the song to the playing queue, completing the primary task of Subgoal 5.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.50\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [78, 170, 103, 547], \\'text\\': \\'Whispers of the Past\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [144, 48, 168, 172], \\'text\\': \\'Songs\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [147, 268, 163, 391], \\'text\\': \\'Artists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [146, 490, 163, 630], \\'text\\': \\'Albums\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [145, 729, 163, 952], \\'text\\': \\'Album artist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [202, 19, 214, 122], \\'text\\': \\'SONG S\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [242, 185, 288, 562], \\'text\\': \\'Whispers of the Past Music\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [765, 697, 793, 917], \\'text\\': \\'Keyboard\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [848, 171, 867, 565], \\'text\\': \\'Through the Storm Liam\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [920, 867, 941, 927], \\'text\\': \\'=\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [945, 251, 961, 350], \\'text\\': \\'Songs\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 444, 179, 669]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 681, 179, 990]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 222, 179, 431]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 8, 179, 210]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [746, 567, 809, 964]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [899, 211, 970, 386]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [908, 840, 956, 961]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [904, 52, 960, 151]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [242, 884, 294, 995]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [74, 908, 107, 978]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 37, 243]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [900, 629, 983, 771]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [897, 364, 1000, 634]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [833, 34, 881, 141]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) located at the right end of the search bar, which currently displays \\'Forever Young\\'. The icon is located at approximately [88, 938]. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing me to input the next song title, \\'Whispers of the Past\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) next to the search term \\'Forever Young\\' was successful. The search field was cleared, and it now displays \\'Search\\'. The song list area below now shows \\'No results\\'. This action successfully prepared the interface for searching the next song, \\'Whispers of the Past\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field, which currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. The search field is located at approximately [88, 234]. This action is expected to activate the search field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to input the song title \\'Whispers of the Past\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field at [88, 234] was successful. The search field is now active, and the virtual keyboard has appeared (indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' at the bottom of the screen). This prepares the interface for inputting the song title \\'Whispers of the Past\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Whispers of the Past\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Whispers of the Past\\n\\' into the active search field. The search field is currently empty and ready for input. This action will type \\'Whispers of the Past\\' into the field, and the newline character will initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for \\'Whispers of the Past\\' and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Whispers of the Past\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and \\'Whispers of the Past\\' is now visible in the search results. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the song to the queue.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,939],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located to the right of the song \\'Whispers of the Past\\'. The icon is within the bounding box `[243, 885, 293, 993]`. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playing queue\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon next to \\'Whispers of the Past\\' was successful. A context menu appeared, displaying various options for the song, including \\'Add to playing queue\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the necessary option to add the song to the queue is now accessible.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[385,758],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playing queue\\' option in the context menu. The option is located at approximately `[385, 758]`. This action is expected to add the song \\'Whispers of the Past\\' to the playing queue. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playing queue\\' for the song \\'Whispers of the Past\\' was successful. The context menu closed, and the screen returned to the view showing \\'Whispers of the Past\\'. This action successfully added the song to the playing queue, completing the primary task of Subgoal 5.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 24: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) located at the right end of the search bar, which currently displays \\'Whispers of the Past\\'. The icon is located at approximately [88, 938]. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing me to input the next song title, \\'Heartbeat Away\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Retro Music app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"Retro Music app is open and its main interface is visible.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field, which currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. The search field is located at approximately [88, 234]. This action is expected to activate the search field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to input the song title \\'Whispers of the Past\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field at [88, 234] was successful. The search field is now active, and the virtual keyboard has appeared (indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' at the bottom of the screen). This prepares the interface for inputting the song title \\'Whispers of the Past\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Whispers of the Past\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Whispers of the Past\\n\\' into the active search field. The search field is currently empty and ready for input. This action will type \\'Whispers of the Past\\' into the field, and the newline character will initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for \\'Whispers of the Past\\' and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Whispers of the Past\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and \\'Whispers of the Past\\' is now visible in the search results. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the song to the queue.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,939],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located to the right of the song \\'Whispers of the Past\\'. The icon is within the bounding box `[243, 885, 293, 993]`. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playing queue\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon next to \\'Whispers of the Past\\' was successful. A context menu appeared, displaying various options for the song, including \\'Add to playing queue\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the necessary option to add the song to the queue is now accessible.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[385,758],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playing queue\\' option in the context menu. The option is located at approximately `[385, 758]`. This action is expected to add the song \\'Whispers of the Past\\' to the playing queue. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playing queue\\' for the song \\'Whispers of the Past\\' was successful. The context menu closed, and the screen returned to the view showing \\'Whispers of the Past\\'. This action successfully added the song to the playing queue, completing the primary task of Subgoal 5.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) located at the right end of the search bar, which currently displays \\'Whispers of the Past\\'. The icon is located at approximately [88, 938]. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing me to input the next song title, \\'Heartbeat Away\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) next to the search term \\'Whispers of the Past\\' was successful. The search field was cleared, and it now displays \\'Search\\'. The song list area below now shows \\'No results\\'. This action successfully prepared the interface for searching the next song, \\'Heartbeat Away\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 132], \\'text\\': \\'15.51\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [80, 171, 97, 298], \\'text\\': \\'Search\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [144, 48, 168, 172], \\'text\\': \\'Songs\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [147, 268, 163, 391], \\'text\\': \\'Artists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [146, 490, 163, 630], \\'text\\': \\'Albums\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [145, 729, 163, 952], \\'text\\': \\'Album artist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [505, 386, 526, 622], \\'text\\': \\'No results\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [765, 697, 793, 917], \\'text\\': \\'Keyboard\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [848, 171, 867, 565], \\'text\\': \\'Through the Storm Liam\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [920, 867, 941, 927], \\'text\\': \\'=\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [945, 251, 961, 350], \\'text\\': \\'Songs\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 444, 179, 669]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 222, 179, 432]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 681, 179, 990]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 8, 180, 210]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [746, 567, 809, 964]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [899, 210, 969, 386]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [904, 51, 960, 151]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [908, 841, 956, 960]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 902, 110, 982]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [898, 364, 1000, 634]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 194, 38, 244]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [905, 642, 963, 761]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 819, 39, 945]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [833, 34, 881, 141]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field, which currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. The search field is located at approximately [88, 234]. This action is expected to activate the search field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to input the song title \\'Whispers of the Past\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field at [88, 234] was successful. The search field is now active, and the virtual keyboard has appeared (indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' at the bottom of the screen). This prepares the interface for inputting the song title \\'Whispers of the Past\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Whispers of the Past\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Whispers of the Past\\n\\' into the active search field. The search field is currently empty and ready for input. This action will type \\'Whispers of the Past\\' into the field, and the newline character will initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for \\'Whispers of the Past\\' and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Whispers of the Past\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and \\'Whispers of the Past\\' is now visible in the search results. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the song to the queue.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,939],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located to the right of the song \\'Whispers of the Past\\'. The icon is within the bounding box `[243, 885, 293, 993]`. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playing queue\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon next to \\'Whispers of the Past\\' was successful. A context menu appeared, displaying various options for the song, including \\'Add to playing queue\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the necessary option to add the song to the queue is now accessible.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[385,758],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playing queue\\' option in the context menu. The option is located at approximately `[385, 758]`. This action is expected to add the song \\'Whispers of the Past\\' to the playing queue. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playing queue\\' for the song \\'Whispers of the Past\\' was successful. The context menu closed, and the screen returned to the view showing \\'Whispers of the Past\\'. This action successfully added the song to the playing queue, completing the primary task of Subgoal 5.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) located at the right end of the search bar, which currently displays \\'Whispers of the Past\\'. The icon is located at approximately [88, 938]. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing me to input the next song title, \\'Heartbeat Away\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) next to the search term \\'Whispers of the Past\\' was successful. The search field was cleared, and it now displays \\'Search\\'. The song list area below now shows \\'No results\\'. This action successfully prepared the interface for searching the next song, \\'Heartbeat Away\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 25: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

The search field is currently empty and ready for input. This action will type \\'Whispers of the Past\\' into the field, and the newline character will initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for \\'Whispers of the Past\\' and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Whispers of the Past\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and \\'Whispers of the Past\\' is now visible in the search results. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the song to the queue.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

The icon is within the bounding box `[243, 885, 293, 993]`. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playing queue\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon next to \\'Whispers of the Past\\' was successful. A context menu appeared, displaying various options for the song, including \\'Add to playing queue\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the necessary option to add the song to the queue is now accessible.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[385,758],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playing queue\\' option in the context menu.

This action is expected to activate the search field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to input the song title \\'Heartbeat Away\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field at [88, 234] was successful. The search field is now active, indicated by the cursor and the appearance of \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' at the bottom of the screen. The placeholder text \\'Search\\' now has a cursor at the beginning. This prepares the interface for inputting the song title \\'Heartbeat Away\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 132], \\'text\\': \\'15.51\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [75, 168, 102, 302], \\'text\\': \\'|earch\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [144, 48, 168, 172], \\'text\\': \\'Songs\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [147, 268, 163, 391], \\'text\\': \\'Artists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [146, 490, 163, 630], \\'text\\': \\'Albums\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [145, 729, 163, 952], \\'text\\': \\'Album artist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [480, 386, 502, 622], \\'text\\': \\'No results\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [718, 696, 747, 918], \\'text\\': \\'Keyboard\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [848, 171, 867, 565], \\'text\\': \\'Through the Storm Liam\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 444, 179, 669]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 222, 179, 432]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 681, 179, 990]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 8, 179, 210]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [698, 563, 763, 966]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 902, 110, 982]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 819, 40, 948]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [833, 895, 881, 989]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 194, 38, 243]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The search field is currently empty and ready for input. This action will type \\'Whispers of the Past\\' into the field, and the newline character will initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for \\'Whispers of the Past\\' and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Whispers of the Past\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and \\'Whispers of the Past\\' is now visible in the search results. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the song to the queue.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,939],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located to the right of the song \\'Whispers of the Past\\'. The icon is within the bounding box `[243, 885, 293, 993]`. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playing queue\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon next to \\'Whispers of the Past\\' was successful. A context menu appeared, displaying various options for the song, including \\'Add to playing queue\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the necessary option to add the song to the queue is now accessible.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[385,758],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playing queue\\' option in the context menu. The option is located at approximately `[385, 758]`. This action is expected to add the song \\'Whispers of the Past\\' to the playing queue. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playing queue\\' for the song \\'Whispers of the Past\\' was successful. The context menu closed, and the screen returned to the view showing \\'Whispers of the Past\\'. This action successfully added the song to the playing queue, completing the primary task of Subgoal 5.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) located at the right end of the search bar, which currently displays \\'Whispers of the Past\\'. The icon is located at approximately [88, 938]. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing me to input the next song title, \\'Heartbeat Away\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) next to the search term \\'Whispers of the Past\\' was successful. The search field was cleared, and it now displays \\'Search\\'. The song list area below now shows \\'No results\\'. This action successfully prepared the interface for searching the next song, \\'Heartbeat Away\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field, which currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. The search field is located at approximately [88, 234]. This action is expected to activate the search field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to input the song title \\'Heartbeat Away\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field at [88, 234] was successful. The search field is now active, indicated by the cursor and the appearance of \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' at the bottom of the screen. The placeholder text \\'Search\\' now has a cursor at the beginning. This prepares the interface for inputting the song title \\'Heartbeat Away\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 26: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Heartbeat Away\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Heartbeat Away\\n\\' into the active search field. The search field is currently empty and ready for input. This action will type \\'Heartbeat Away\\' into the field, and the newline character will initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for \\'Heartbeat Away\\' and display the results.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,939],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located to the right of the song \\'Whispers of the Past\\'. The icon is within the bounding box `[243, 885, 293, 993]`. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playing queue\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon next to \\'Whispers of the Past\\' was successful. A context menu appeared, displaying various options for the song, including \\'Add to playing queue\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the necessary option to add the song to the queue is now accessible.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[385,758],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playing queue\\' option in the context menu. The option is located at approximately `[385, 758]`. This action is expected to add the song \\'Whispers of the Past\\' to the playing queue. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playing queue\\' for the song \\'Whispers of the Past\\' was successful. The context menu closed, and the screen returned to the view showing \\'Whispers of the Past\\'. This action successfully added the song to the playing queue, completing the primary task of Subgoal 5.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) located at the right end of the search bar, which currently displays \\'Whispers of the Past\\'. The icon is located at approximately [88, 938]. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing me to input the next song title, \\'Heartbeat Away\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) next to the search term \\'Whispers of the Past\\' was successful. The search field was cleared, and it now displays \\'Search\\'. The song list area below now shows \\'No results\\'. This action successfully prepared the interface for searching the next song, \\'Heartbeat Away\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field, which currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. The search field is located at approximately [88, 234]. This action is expected to activate the search field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to input the song title \\'Heartbeat Away\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field at [88, 234] was successful. The search field is now active, indicated by the cursor and the appearance of \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' at the bottom of the screen. The placeholder text \\'Search\\' now has a cursor at the beginning. This prepares the interface for inputting the song title \\'Heartbeat Away\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Heartbeat Away\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Heartbeat Away\\n\\' into the active search field. The search field is currently empty and ready for input. This action will type \\'Heartbeat Away\\' into the field, and the newline character will initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for \\'Heartbeat Away\\' and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Heartbeat Away\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and \\'Heartbeat Away\\' is now visible in the search results. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the song to the queue.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.52\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [79, 172, 102, 462], \\'text\\': \\'Heartbeat Away\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [144, 48, 168, 172], \\'text\\': \\'Songs\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [147, 268, 163, 391], \\'text\\': \\'Artists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [146, 490, 163, 630], \\'text\\': \\'Albums\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [145, 729, 163, 952], \\'text\\': \\'Album artist\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [202, 19, 214, 122], \\'text\\': \\'SONG S\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [243, 186, 266, 477], \\'text\\': \\'Heartbeat Away\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [272, 188, 288, 289], \\'text\\': \\'Music\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [718, 696, 747, 918], \\'text\\': \\'Keyboard\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [848, 171, 867, 565], \\'text\\': \\'Through the Storm Liam\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 444, 179, 669]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 682, 179, 990]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 222, 179, 431]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 8, 179, 210]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [698, 563, 763, 966]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [240, 35, 294, 158]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [74, 908, 107, 977]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [243, 884, 294, 994]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 819, 39, 949]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [833, 33, 881, 142]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 37, 243]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [832, 895, 881, 987]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [899, 216, 949, 382]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,939],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located to the right of the song \\'Whispers of the Past\\'. The icon is within the bounding box `[243, 885, 293, 993]`. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playing queue\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon next to \\'Whispers of the Past\\' was successful. A context menu appeared, displaying various options for the song, including \\'Add to playing queue\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the necessary option to add the song to the queue is now accessible.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[385,758],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playing queue\\' option in the context menu. The option is located at approximately `[385, 758]`. This action is expected to add the song \\'Whispers of the Past\\' to the playing queue. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playing queue\\' for the song \\'Whispers of the Past\\' was successful. The context menu closed, and the screen returned to the view showing \\'Whispers of the Past\\'. This action successfully added the song to the playing queue, completing the primary task of Subgoal 5.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) located at the right end of the search bar, which currently displays \\'Whispers of the Past\\'. The icon is located at approximately [88, 938]. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing me to input the next song title, \\'Heartbeat Away\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) next to the search term \\'Whispers of the Past\\' was successful. The search field was cleared, and it now displays \\'Search\\'. The song list area below now shows \\'No results\\'. This action successfully prepared the interface for searching the next song, \\'Heartbeat Away\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field, which currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. The search field is located at approximately [88, 234]. This action is expected to activate the search field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to input the song title \\'Heartbeat Away\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field at [88, 234] was successful. The search field is now active, indicated by the cursor and the appearance of \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' at the bottom of the screen. The placeholder text \\'Search\\' now has a cursor at the beginning. This prepares the interface for inputting the song title \\'Heartbeat Away\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Heartbeat Away\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Heartbeat Away\\n\\' into the active search field. The search field is currently empty and ready for input. This action will type \\'Heartbeat Away\\' into the field, and the newline character will initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for \\'Heartbeat Away\\' and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Heartbeat Away\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and \\'Heartbeat Away\\' is now visible in the search results. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the song to the queue.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 27: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,939],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located to the right of the song \\'Heartbeat Away\\'. The icon is within the bounding box `[243, 884, 293, 994]`. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playing queue\\'.

Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[385,758],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playing queue\\' option in the context menu. The option is located at approximately `[385, 758]`. This action is expected to add the song \\'Whispers of the Past\\' to the playing queue. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playing queue\\' for the song \\'Whispers of the Past\\' was successful. The context menu closed, and the screen returned to the view showing \\'Whispers of the Past\\'. This action successfully added the song to the playing queue, completing the primary task of Subgoal 5.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) located at the right end of the search bar, which currently displays \\'Whispers of the Past\\'. The icon is located at approximately [88, 938]. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing me to input the next song title, \\'Heartbeat Away\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) next to the search term \\'Whispers of the Past\\' was successful. The search field was cleared, and it now displays \\'Search\\'. The song list area below now shows \\'No results\\'. This action successfully prepared the interface for searching the next song, \\'Heartbeat Away\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field, which currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. The search field is located at approximately [88, 234]. This action is expected to activate the search field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to input the song title \\'Heartbeat Away\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field at [88, 234] was successful. The search field is now active, indicated by the cursor and the appearance of \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' at the bottom of the screen. The placeholder text \\'Search\\' now has a cursor at the beginning. This prepares the interface for inputting the song title \\'Heartbeat Away\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Heartbeat Away\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Heartbeat Away\\n\\' into the active search field. The search field is currently empty and ready for input. This action will type \\'Heartbeat Away\\' into the field, and the newline character will initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for \\'Heartbeat Away\\' and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Heartbeat Away\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and \\'Heartbeat Away\\' is now visible in the search results. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the song to the queue.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,939],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located to the right of the song \\'Heartbeat Away\\'. The icon is within the bounding box `[243, 884, 293, 994]`. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playing queue\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon next to \\'Heartbeat Away\\' was successful. A context menu appeared, displaying various options for the song, including \\'Add to playing queue\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the necessary option to add the song to the queue is now accessible.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing.

Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9.

Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Add to playing queue\\' for the song \\'Whispers of the Past\\' was successful. The context menu closed, and the screen returned to the view showing \\'Whispers of the Past\\'. This action successfully added the song to the playing queue, completing the primary task of Subgoal 5.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,938],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) located at the right end of the search bar, which currently displays \\'Whispers of the Past\\'. The icon is located at approximately [88, 938]. This action is expected to clear the search field, allowing me to input the next song title, \\'Heartbeat Away\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'x\\' icon (clear button) next to the search term \\'Whispers of the Past\\' was successful. The search field was cleared, and it now displays \\'Search\\'. The song list area below now shows \\'No results\\'. This action successfully prepared the interface for searching the next song, \\'Heartbeat Away\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,234],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field, which currently displays \\'Search\\' as placeholder text. The search field is located at approximately [88, 234]. This action is expected to activate the search field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing me to input the song title \\'Heartbeat Away\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search field at [88, 234] was successful. The search field is now active, indicated by the cursor and the appearance of \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' at the bottom of the screen. The placeholder text \\'Search\\' now has a cursor at the beginning. This prepares the interface for inputting the song title \\'Heartbeat Away\\', bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Heartbeat Away\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'Heartbeat Away\\n\\' into the active search field. The search field is currently empty and ready for input. This action will type \\'Heartbeat Away\\' into the field, and the newline character will initiate the search. The predicted outcome is that the app will search for \\'Heartbeat Away\\' and display the results. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Heartbeat Away\\\\n\\' into the search field was successful. The app searched for the song, and \\'Heartbeat Away\\' is now visible in the search results. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding the song to the queue.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[268,939],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots menu icon located to the right of the song \\'Heartbeat Away\\'. The icon is within the bounding box `[243, 884, 293, 994]`. This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the song, including \\'Add to playing queue\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots menu icon next to \\'Heartbeat Away\\' was successful. A context menu appeared, displaying various options for the song, including \\'Add to playing queue\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the necessary option to add the song to the queue is now accessible.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 28: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[385,758],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add to playing queue\\' option in the context menu. The option is located at approximately `[385, 758]`. This action is expected to add the song \\'Heartbeat Away\\' to the playing queue and close the context menu.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",
